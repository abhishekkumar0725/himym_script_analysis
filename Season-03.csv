3,20,1,It's 10:,"0 in the morning.
"
3,20,2,God sent those lice to my head like he sent the locusts to Egypt:,
3,20,3,I know what he saw:,"boobs. Scotch.
"
3,8,1,"Now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled to post online at 10:","0, and it was 9:59.
"
3,8,2,It's true what they say:,"blondes have more fun.
"
3,9,1,Ted from 2030:,"Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.
"
3,9,2,Barney:,"No way! March does not have 31 days.
"
3,9,3,Marshall:,"Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge.
"
3,9,4,Ted & Robin:,"General knowledge.
"
3,9,5,Ted from 2030:,"And we did it all the time.
"
3,9,6,Lily:,"Isn't it sad? I mean in 2007, some countries actually still condone corporal punishment.
"
3,9,7,Ted & Robin:,"Corporal punishment.
"
3,9,8,Ted from 2030:,"Because once you start, it's surprisingly hard to stop.
"
3,9,9,Marshall:,"Oh, man, I got a kernel stuck in my teeth.
"
3,9,10,Ted & Robin:,"Colonel stuck-in-my-teeth.
"
3,9,11,Ted from 2030:,"But now, we were broken up,so when Marshall said...
"
3,9,12,Marshall:,"But after the first year,I get a major pay raise.
"
3,9,13,Ted from 2030:,"We just let it slide. You see, on the surface, Robin and I looked like we were doing great. But the truth is, trying to be friends with your ex is a lot harder than it looks. You can't be as candid as you used to be.
"
3,9,14,Ted:,"So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced... (Robin and Lily walk across the room) Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.
"
3,9,15,Ted from 2030:,"But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.
"
3,9,16,Barney:,"I gotta go.
"
3,9,17,Marshall:,"I'm gonna go pay.
"
3,9,18,Lily:,"Peeing.
"
3,9,19,Ted:,"I'm gonna help marshall pay.
"
3,9,20,Robin:,"I'm gonna help lily pee.
"
3,9,21,Lily:,"All right,we have a turkey.
"
3,9,22,Marshall:,"Yeah, we do.
"
3,9,23,Lily:,"Isn't this exciting? Our first Thanksgiving together as a group.
"
3,9,24,Marshall:,"Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever.
"
3,9,25,Barney:,"What?
"
3,9,26,Marshall:,"I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever.
"
3,9,27,Ted:,"yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right?
"
3,9,28,Robin:,"Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob.
"
3,9,29,Lily:,"Bob? You've been on, like, three dates with that guy. We haven't even met him.
"
3,9,30,Robin:,"Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal?
"
3,9,31,Lily:,"Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, ""Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob.""
"
3,9,32,Robin:,"I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.
"
3,9,33,Barney:,"I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,""the real Thanksgiving""? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?
"
3,9,34,Robin:,"Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.
"
3,9,35,Barney:,"Why are you guys even a country?
"
3,9,36,Marshall:,"Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade.
"
3,9,37,Barney:,"Well, there, you said it again.
"
3,9,38,Marshall:,"Said what?
"
3,9,39,Barney:,"Slapsgiving.
"
3,9,40,Marshall:,"Oh, I guess I did. You know why? I've invented a new holiday: Slapsgiving. It's the one day we set aside each year to gather together and give slaps.
"
3,9,41,Ted from 2030:,"I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third.
"
3,9,42,"Marshall, on the phone with Barney:","slapcountdown.com.
"
3,9,43,Barney:,"no.
"
3,9,44,Barney:,"No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out.
"
3,9,45,Ted:,"How many days are in october?
"
3,9,46,Barney:,"Uh, thirty.
"
3,9,47,Ted:,"Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.
"
3,9,48,"Barney, with a funny accent:","I like Halloween very much. Is nice.
"
3,9,49,Ted:,"Is also tomorrow.
"
3,9,50,Barney:,"Damn it!
"
3,9,51,Barney:,"Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?
"
3,9,52,Marshall:,"Slapsgiving.
"
3,9,53,Barney:,"That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?
"
3,9,54,Lily:,"The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.
"
3,9,55,Barney:,"Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving...
"
3,9,56,Marshall:,"Slapsgiving.
"
3,9,57,Barney:,"..at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.
"
3,9,58,Marhall:,"Really?
"
3,9,59,Barney:,"Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.
"
3,9,60,Marshall:,"And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand.
"
3,9,61,Robin:,"Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us.
"
3,9,62,Ted:,"How old is he?
"
3,9,63,Robin:,"He's forty-one. Hey, bob! Over here!
"
3,9,64,Ted from 2030:,"Okay, kids, the truth is, Bob probably looked like this.
"
3,9,65,Bob:,"Hey, sweetie.
"
3,9,66,Robin:,"Hi.
"
3,9,67,Ted from 2030:,"But when your ex is dating someone new your mind tends to accentuate their flaws. This is how I saw bob.
"
3,9,68,Bob:,"Hey, dudes,what's crackin'?.
"
3,9,69,Ted:,"Hey, man, how are you?
"
3,9,70,Bob:,"Good to meet you. Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with my parents.
"
3,9,71,Ted:,"Parents?
"
3,9,72,Bob:,"They were totally on my case: ""What are you gonna do with your life? You're forty-one."" and I'm like, ""Chillax, snowboarding is a legit career. you ought to be stoked I found my bliss."" and speaking of bliss,sugar me, baby. ( Robin and Bob kiss)
"
3,9,73,Robin:,"Let's go get a drink.
"
3,9,74,Ted:,"Unbelievable. Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher.
"
3,9,75,Lily:,"What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great.
"
3,9,76,Marshall:,"Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass.
"
3,9,77,Ted:,"How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?
"
3,9,78,Barney:,"Nothing but respect for that man.
"
3,9,79,Lily:,"Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.
"
3,9,80,Marshall:,"For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.
"
3,9,81,Ted:,"Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?
"
3,9,82,Lily:,"7:30.
"
3,9,83,Ted:,"Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.
"
3,9,84,Ted:,"Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily?
"
3,9,85,Robin:,"Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.
"
3,9,86,Ted:,"Is Bob coming?
"
3,9,87,Robin:,"No, he went to see green day.
"
3,9,88,Ted:,"So it's...
"
3,9,89,Ted and Robin:,"..just the two of us.
"
3,9,90,Robin:,"Making pies.
"
3,9,91,Ted:,"Pies. They're things that friends make together.
"
3,9,92,Robin:,"Yeah, they do.
"
3,9,93,Ted:,"Great.
"
3,9,94,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
3,9,95,Ted:,"Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up.
"
3,9,96,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
3,9,97,Ted:,"I'm going to make a phone call. (On the phone with Barney who is at the Bar) Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.
"
3,9,98,Barney:,"Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.
"
3,9,99,Ted:,"Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...
"
3,9,100,Barney:,"Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.
"
3,9,101,Ted:,"You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?
"
3,9,102,Barney:,"No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.
"
3,9,103,Ted:,"So you're not coming to make pies.
"
3,9,104,Barney:,"No, no. Thank you, mr. President. (He hungs up) Sorry.
"
3,9,105,Ted from 2030:,"After a very long night, it was finally the big holiday. Sorry, the two big holidays.
"
3,9,106,Lily:,"Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?
"
3,9,107,Marshall:,"In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.
"
3,9,108,Barney:,"Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce, ""Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness.""
"
3,9,109,Robin:,"Hey, ted.
"
3,9,110,Ted:,"Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
"
3,9,111,Robin:,"You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?
"
3,9,112,Ted:,"yep.
"
3,9,113,Robin:,"Great.
"
3,9,114,Ted:,"Marshall?
"
3,9,115,Robin:,"Lily?
"
3,9,116,Ted and Robin:,"Something really weird happened last night.
"
3,9,117,Marshall:,"What do you mean something weird happened last night?
"
3,9,118,Ted:,"You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together.
"
3,9,119,Ted:,"So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.
"
3,9,120,Ted:,"I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.
"
3,9,121,Barney:,"Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...
"
3,9,122,Marshall:,"You're still getting slapped.
"
3,9,123,Ted:,"I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.
"
3,9,124,Robin:,"I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.
"
3,9,125,Lily:,"Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.
"
3,9,126,Robin:,"I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.
"
3,9,127,Lily:,"Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.
"
3,9,128,Robin:,"And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.
"
3,9,129,Lily:,"Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.
"
3,9,130,Robin:,"He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.
"
3,9,131,Robin:,"Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?
"
3,9,132,Ted:,"Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?
"
3,9,133,Barney:,"Ooh. terrible.
"
3,9,134,Ted:,"What?! I thought it would break the ice.
"
3,9,135,Robin:,"I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.
"
3,9,136,Lily:,"How do you respond to something like that?
"
3,9,137,Robin:,"Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?
"
3,9,138,Ted:,"Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!
"
3,9,139,Robin:,"Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?
"
3,9,140,Ted:,"Pecan pie? Why are we making that?
"
3,9,141,Robin:,"Um, it's my favorite.
"
3,9,142,Ted:,"You're allergic.
"
3,9,143,Robin:,"I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.
"
3,9,144,Ted:,"So we're making a pie for Bob.
"
3,9,145,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
3,9,146,Barney:,"She's got you making pies for this guy?
"
3,9,147,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
3,9,148,Marshall:,"That is a real slap in the face.
"
3,9,149,Ted:,"You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.
"
3,9,150,Robin:,"Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.
"
3,9,151,Ted:,"Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?
"
3,9,152,Robin:,"I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?
"
3,9,153,Ted:,"Yes.
"
3,9,154,Robin:,"Why?
"
3,9,155,Ted:,"Because he's a thousand years old.
"
3,9,156,Lily:,"No, Ted! What are you doing?
"
3,9,157,Robin:,"Right?
"
3,9,158,Ted:,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,
"
3,9,159,Robin:,"Come on.
"
3,9,160,Ted:,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.
"
3,9,161,Robin:,"Ted...
"
3,9,162,Ted:,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?
"
3,9,163,Robin:,"He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?
"
3,9,164,Ted:,"I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.
"
3,9,165,Robin:,"It's mean.
"
3,9,166,Ted:,"Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?
"
3,9,167,Robin:,"First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?
"
3,9,168,Ted:,"Hey, that is...
"
3,9,169,Robin:,"And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?
"
3,9,170,Ted:,"Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.
"
3,9,171,Robin:,"Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.
"
3,9,172,Ted:,"I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.
"
3,9,173,Robin:,"I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.
"
3,9,174,Ted:,"me, too.
"
3,9,175,"Lily, Marshall and Barney:","You guys slept together last night?
"
3,9,176,Lily:,"That is a terrible idea!
"
3,9,177,Marshall:,"Horrible idea.
"
3,9,178,Barney:,"Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!
"
3,9,179,Lily:,"What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...
"
3,9,180,Robin:,"You are correct, Sir.
"
3,9,181,Lily:,"..who's coming to my thanksgiving today...
"
3,9,182,Robin:,"That is a truth-fact.
"
3,9,183,Lily:,"..an event Ted is also attending.
"
3,9,184,Robin:,"kablammo.
"
3,9,185,Lily:,"Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!
"
3,9,186,Robin:,"Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.
"
3,9,187,Lily:,"Well, did you guys at least talk about it?
"
3,9,188,Ted:," There's office material...
"
3,9,189,Robin:,"I hear something burning...
"
3,9,190,Ted:,"Clearly, we need to ignore this.
"
3,9,191,Robin:,"Clearly, we need to talk about this.
"
3,9,192,Ted and Robin:,"You know? to save the friendship.
"
3,9,193,Robin:,"We need to talk.
"
3,9,194,Ted:,"Stuffed mushroom?
"
3,9,195,Robin:,"We need to talk about last night.
"
3,9,196,Ted:,"Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?
"
3,9,197,Robin:,"Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...
"
3,9,198,Ted:,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?
"
3,9,199,Robin:,"What?! you're crazy!
"
3,9,200,Ted:,"We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.
"
3,9,201,Robin:,"Only because your hand was still around my waist.
"
3,9,202,Ted:,"Oh, come on! You leaned into it.
"
3,9,203,Robin:,"I... leaned into it?
"
3,9,204,Ted:,"Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...""Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.""
"
3,9,205,Robin:,"Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?
"
3,9,206,Ted:,"My on-base percentage was off the charts!
"
3,9,207,Marshall:,"Oh, no! The slap-petizers.
"
3,9,208,Lily:,"You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?
"
3,9,209,Barney:,"Um, most Thanksgivings.
"
3,9,210,Marshall:,"Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing.
"
3,9,211,Lily:,"Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe.
"
3,9,212,Marshall:,"Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.
"
3,9,213,Barney:,"I'm not scared.
"
3,9,214,Marshall:,"Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.
"
3,9,215,Barney:,"Please don't slap me.
"
3,9,216,Marshall:,"I'm sorry, what?
"
3,9,217,Barney:,"Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!
"
3,9,218,Marshall:,"I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?
"
3,9,219,Barney:,"Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.
"
3,9,220,Marshall:,"Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.
"
3,9,221,Barney:,"Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!
"
3,9,222,Marshall:,"But it's Slapsgiving.
"
3,9,223,Lily:,"No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!
"
3,9,224,Marshall:,"What?!
"
3,9,225,Barney:,"Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!
"
3,9,226,Bob:,"What's up, dudes?
"
3,9,227,All:,"Hey, bob.
"
3,9,228,Marshall:,"Baby,please... -no!
"
3,9,229,Lily:,"The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.
"
3,9,230,Bob:,"Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches.
"
3,9,231,Robin:,"Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?
"
3,9,232,Ted:,"Apparently not.
"
3,9,233,Robin:,"What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.
"
3,9,234,Ted:,"We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.
"
3,9,235,Robin:,"Well, maybe we should stop pretending.
"
3,9,236,Ted:,"Maybe we should.
"
3,9,237,Robin:,"So... what do we do now?
"
3,9,238,Ted:,"I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.
"
3,9,239,Robin:,"Okay.
"
3,9,240,Ted:,"Happy Thanksgiving.
"
3,9,241,Ted from 2030:,"So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last.
"
3,9,242,Barney:,"Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?
"
3,9,243,Marshall:,"No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words.
"
3,9,244,Lily:,"Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.
"
3,9,245,Marshall:,"Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.
"
3,9,246,Bob:,"This is rad! A nice, small,simple Thanksgiving. I'm the youngest of ten in my family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess. All the yelling and the screaming...
"
3,9,247,Ted from 2030:,"And then a funny thing happened...
"
3,9,248,Bob:,"It's really a major buzz-kill.
"
3,9,249,Ted and Robin:,"Major buzz-kill.
"
3,9,250,Lily:,"Oh, no...
"
3,9,251,Barney:,"I thought we were done with that?
"
3,9,252,Robin:,"I guess we're not.
"
3,9,253,Ted:,"Guess we're not.
"
3,9,254,Ted from 2030:,"You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.
"
3,9,255,Barney:,"Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing.
"
3,9,256,Lily:,"Barney, put it away.
"
3,9,257,Barney:,"How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?
"
3,9,258,Voice:,"The slap will occur in ten..
"
3,9,259,Barney:,"Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!
"
3,9,260,Lily:,"Barney, put it away.
"
3,9,261,Voice:,"..six...
"
3,9,262,Barney:,"I will in... five...
"
3,9,263,Voice:,".. five, four...
"
3,9,264,Lily:,"You can slap him.
"
3,9,265,Voice:,"..three...
"
3,9,266,Barney:,"What?! Wait, you...
"
3,9,267,Voice:,"..two...one.
"
3,9,268,Marshall:,"That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights! (Marshall starts playing the piano and singing) *What is this feelin' that's put you in your place a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face you feel the blood rush to your cheek. Tears start to fill your eyes and your lips are tremblin' but you can't speak,you're tryin', oh, you're tryin' not to cry! You just got sla-apped-oh, oh! Across the face, my friend-oh, oh, oh! You just got slapped. Yes, that really just happened. Everybody saw it and everybody laughed and clapped, it was awesome. Wait,you just got... slapped. Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.*
"
3,9,269,Lily:,"Well, guys have fun.
"
3,9,270,Ted:,"This is gonna be majoy cleaner.
"
3,9,271,All:,"Major cleaner!
"
3,9,272,Marshall:,"Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?
"
3,9,273,Robin:,"That's the general idea.
"
3,9,274,All:,"General idea.
"
3,19,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange have been happening to your uncle Barney. He's been doing great with a woman.
"
3,19,2,Barney:,"So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.
"
3,19,3,Ted from 2030:,"He's only been gone a few moments but when he return...
"
3,19,4,Barney:,"So where were we?
"
3,19,5,Ted from 2030:,"..he gets slap! It kept happening...
"
3,19,6,Woman:,"Jerk!
"
3,19,7,Ted from 2030:,"Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...
"
3,19,8,Barney:,"Again? Really? Wait...
"
3,19,9,Ted from 2030:,"Barney knew who to look for...
"
3,19,10,Barney:,"Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?
"
3,19,11,Woman:,"No.
"
3,19,12,Barney:,"What are you doing on Friday?
"
3,19,13,Barney:,"Stop! Amy?
"
3,19,14,Abby:,"Abby.
"
3,19,15,Barney:,"Riiiggghhhttt!!!
"
3,19,16,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...
"
3,19,17,Lily:,"A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful!
"
3,19,18,Ted from 2030:,"But then, that thousand-and-first time...
"
3,19,19,Lily:,"You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?
"
3,19,20,Ted:,"Hey, how was your day?
"
3,19,21,Lily:,"Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.
"
3,19,22,Ted:,"A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.
"
3,19,23,Marshall:,"So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.
"
3,19,24,Lily:,"But we can barely afford that to begin with.
"
3,19,25,Marshall:,"I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.
"
3,19,26,Lily:,"Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom.
"
3,19,27,Marshall:,"I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything.
"
3,19,28,Lily:,"What? Why just my clothes?
"
3,19,29,Marshall:,"We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my ""Split Happens"" bowling shirt.
"
3,19,30,Ted:,"Dude.
"
3,19,31,Marshall:,"I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website.
"
3,19,32,Lily:,"You made a Website?
"
3,19,33,Marshall:,"Yeah, it's called ""Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com.""
"
3,19,34,Lily:,"No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real.
"
3,19,35,Marshall:,"I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.
"
3,19,36,Lily:,"Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.
"
3,19,37,Barney:,"Why are you trying to ruin my life?
"
3,19,38,Abby:,"Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.
"
3,19,39,Barney:,"And?
"
3,19,40,Abby:,"That's it.
"
3,19,41,Barney:,"That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.
"
3,19,42,Abby:,"Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?
"
3,19,43,Barney:,"Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.
"
3,19,44,Abby:,"Abby!
"
3,19,45,Barney:,"Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.
"
3,19,46,Abby:,"Ted said Marshall was his best friend.
"
3,19,47,Barney:,"Seven years!
"
3,19,48,Abby:,"Sorry.
"
3,19,49,Barney:,"Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid ""meaningful relationship"" with Stella.
"
3,19,50,Abby:,"I hate Ted.
"
3,19,51,Barney:,"I hate Ted more.
"
3,19,52,Abby:,"Are you as turned on as I am?
"
3,19,53,Barney:,"Probably not quite as much.
"
3,19,54,Abby:,"I'm sorry I yelled out ""Ted.""
"
3,19,55,Barney:,"I'm sorry I yelled out ""Abby.""
"
3,19,56,Abby:,"I am Abby.
"
3,19,57,Barney:,"Oh, cool.
"
3,19,58,Ted:,"This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?
"
3,19,59,Robin:,"Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?
"
3,19,60,Ted:,"As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.
"
3,19,61,Robin:,"Whatever, red cowboy boots.
"
3,19,62,Ted:,"Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.
"
3,19,63,Marshall:,"Hey, Lil, if I were to say ""Ted could never pull them off,"" What would I be talking about?
"
3,19,64,Robin:,"His red cowboy boots.
"
3,19,65,Ted:,"I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.
"
3,19,66,Marshall:,"Oh, okay, uh, today's category: classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin.
"
3,19,67,Robin:,"""The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous.""
"
3,19,68,Lily:,"""The Magnificent Kevin.""
"
3,19,69,Marshall:,"""No Country for Straight Men.""
"
3,19,70,Lily:,"I don't want to sell my clothes!
"
3,19,71,Robin:,"Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk?
"
3,19,72,Marshall:,"Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do.
"
3,19,73,Lily:,"I'll sell my paintings!
"
3,19,74,Marshall:,"What?
"
3,19,75,Lily:,"Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, $500.
"
3,19,76,Marshall:,"Yeah. Totally. But...
"
3,19,77,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...
"
3,19,78,Marshall:,"I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!
"
3,19,79,Ted from 2030:,"But then, that thousand-and-first time...
"
3,19,80,Marshall:,"..that kind of money only goes for real paintings.
"
3,19,81,Lily:,"What does that mean?
"
3,19,82,Marshall:,"Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it.
"
3,19,83,Lily:,"You don't believe in me.
"
3,19,84,Marshall:,"No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you!
"
3,19,85,Lily:,"Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now?
"
3,19,86,Marshall:,"I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic.
"
3,19,87,Lily:,"Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job?
"
3,19,88,Marshall:,"About 1,500 bucks.
"
3,19,89,Lily:,"Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes.
"
3,19,90,Marshall:,"Babe, we need money fast.
"
3,19,91,Lily:,"Well, give me a week.
"
3,19,92,Marshall:,"Okay, a-a week.
"
3,19,93,Lily:,"Fine.
"
3,19,94,Marshall:,"Fine.
"
3,19,95,Ted:,"Pulling... Them... Off.
"
3,19,96,Ted from 2030:,"Lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008 was to display one of her favorite paintings at her friend's gallery. The night didn't go so well. But then at the last minute...
"
3,19,97,Woman:,"I love it.
"
3,19,98,Lily:,"You do?
"
3,19,99,Woman:,"Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?
"
3,19,100,Lily:,"It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!
"
3,19,101,Ted from 2030:,"So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists.
"
3,19,102,Lily:,"We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.
"
3,19,103,Robin:,"Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?
"
3,19,104,Ted:,"Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.
"
3,19,105,Robin:,"Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.
"
3,19,106,Ted:,"Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors ""neat"" or are they more ""neato burrito?""
"
3,19,107,Robin:,"Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.
"
3,19,108,Ted:,"I pull these off! (Everyone is laughing at him) I pull these off!
"
3,19,109,Abby:,"You know what I hate most about Ted?
"
3,19,110,Barney:,"What?
"
3,19,111,Abby:,"His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.
"
3,19,112,Barney:,"You know what I hate most about Ted?
"
3,19,113,Abby:,"What?
"
3,19,114,Barney:,"How he's always like, ""Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with."" He's so lame.
"
3,19,115,Abby:,"He's so lame and awesome.
"
3,19,116,Barney:,"You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.
"
3,19,117,Abby:,"Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"
3,19,118,Barney:,"I think so.
"
3,19,119,Abby:,"You're thinking of having s*x with Ted?
"
3,19,120,Ted from 2030:,"After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate.
"
3,19,121,Lily:,"Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.
"
3,19,122,Man:,"Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?
"
3,19,123,Lily:,"Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?
"
3,19,124,Man:,"Heroin.
"
3,19,125,Lily:,"Do you like heroin?
"
3,19,126,Man:,"Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin.
"
3,19,127,Lily:,"Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...
"
3,19,128,Man:,"It's not very good.
"
3,19,129,Ted from 2030:,"And just as she was about to lose all hope, something amazing happened.
"
3,19,130,Man:,"2 Oh, my God!
"
3,19,131,Lily:,"500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?
"
3,19,132,Marshall:,"Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.
"
3,19,133,Lily:,"Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... ""Suck It!""
"
3,19,134,Marshall:,"Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?
"
3,19,135,Lily:,"Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!
"
3,19,136,Ted:,"You bagged a G-CWOK?!
"
3,19,137,Lily:,"Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.
"
3,19,138,Ted:,"You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.
"
3,19,139,Lily:,"That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.
"
3,19,140,Barney:,"Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?
"
3,19,141,Ted:,"Uh, yeah.
"
3,19,142,Barney:,"Hi, Abby.
"
3,19,143,Ted:,"Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?
"
3,19,144,Barney:,"That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?
"
3,19,145,Abby:,"That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.
"
3,19,146,Barney:,"Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.
"
3,19,147,Abby:,"We're showing Ted how lame he is.
"
3,19,148,Barney:,"You don't have to say it, though.
"
3,19,149,Ted:,"Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.
"
3,19,150,Barney:,"Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.
"
3,19,151,Abby:,"We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing.
"
3,19,152,Ted:,"Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.
"
3,19,153,Barney:,"Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?
"
3,19,154,Abby:,"Wait, really?
"
3,19,155,Barney:,"I would never joke about true love.
"
3,19,156,Abby:,"Yes, I'll marry you.
"
3,19,157,Barney:,"Okay.
"
3,19,158,Abby:,"Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.
"
3,19,159,Barney:,"That's you.
"
3,19,160,Ted:,"Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.
"
3,19,161,Barney:,"Uh, yes, she does.
"
3,19,162,Abby:,"It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.
"
3,19,163,Barney:,"Totally committed to the bit.
"
3,19,164,Lily:,"Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.
"
3,19,165,Man 2:,"Oh, honey, hello.
"
3,19,166,Lily:,"You sound happy.
"
3,19,167,Man 2:,"Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.
"
3,19,168,Lily:,"Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.
"
3,19,169,Man 2:,"Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you. We just bought that for the frame.
"
3,19,170,Lily:,"What?
"
3,19,171,Man 2:,"Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer, a very rare frame from the turn of the century.
"
3,19,172,Lily:,"So... y-you didn't like my painting?
"
3,19,173,Man 2:,"Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all. But you know, good for you.
"
3,19,174,Lily:,"Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?
"
3,19,175,Man 2:,"Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.
"
3,19,176,Lily:,"Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.
"
3,19,177,Man 2:,"Champagne for everyone on me, the happiest guy in the world.
"
3,19,178,Lily:,"This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.
"
3,19,179,Robin:,"Really?
"
3,19,180,Lily:,"Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.
"
3,19,181,Man:,"Da-amn.
"
3,19,182,Lily:,"I got a two-syllable ""damn"" in this dress.
"
3,19,183,Robin:,"A two-syllable ""damn."" That's the dream.
"
3,19,184,Lily:,"Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirl(a)MetroNewsOne.com.
"
3,19,185,Robin:,"It's still in the family.
"
3,19,186,Marshall:,"Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened.
"
3,19,187,Lily:,"What?
"
3,19,188,Marshall:,"I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.
"
3,19,189,Lily:,"Really? Why?
"
3,19,190,Marshall:,"Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.
"
3,19,191,Robin:,"It's still in the family.
"
3,19,192,Marshall:,"And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.
"
3,19,193,Lily:,"Well, what happened?
"
3,19,194,Man 2:,"Well, hello.
"
3,19,195,Marshall:,"Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame.
"
3,19,196,Lawrence:,"Talk about a nice frame. My, my, you are a big one, aren't you? And you're married to that little bit of a thing. How does that work? I'd like to find out.
"
3,19,197,Lily:,"Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you.
"
3,19,198,Marshall:,"No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part.
"
3,19,199,Ted:,"Here's the important part.
"
3,19,200,Ted:,"Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you: what do you think of the boots?
"
3,19,201,Lawrence:,"Walter. Boots.
"
3,19,202,Walter:,"Pulling... Them.... Off.
"
3,19,203,Ted:,"I'll be in the cab.
"
3,19,204,Ted:,"G-CWOK-approved.
"
3,19,205,Lily:,"The painting!
"
3,19,206,Marshall:,"Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster.
"
3,19,207,Marshall:,"It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash.
"
3,19,208,Lily:,"Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?
"
3,19,209,Marshall:,"You're about to find out.
"
3,19,210,Dr Greer:,"I had to make a trash run. Been a busy day-- lots of neuterings.
"
3,19,211,Lily:,"Ooh, we don't need the details.
"
3,19,212,Dr Greer:,"Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think. Oh, thank God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles.
"
3,19,213,Dr Greer:,"Anyway... I noticed your painting just sitting right there on top and I thought, ""Hey,free painting,"" so I brought it upstairs and hung it up in Exam Room 3, and then the strangest thing happened. Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst. I'd never seen Muffin that calm, and then a little later the same thing happened again with Tidbit... and King Larry... and again with the Weinstein triplets.
"
3,19,214,Dr Greer:,"Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility on a very primal level.
"
3,19,215,Lily:,"Really? Dogs like my paintings?
"
3,19,216,Dr Greer:,"Yeah. But you know who it bums out? Birds. Yeah. Had a parrot in there today. He took one look at it, pried open his cage, flew right into the ceiling fan.
"
3,19,217,Marshall:,"Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.
"
3,19,218,Lily:,"Really?
"
3,19,219,Marshall:,"Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.
"
3,19,220,Lily:,"That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.
"
3,19,221,Marshall:,"Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.
"
3,19,222,Lily:,"In what?
"
3,19,223,Marshall:,"In you.
"
3,19,224,Ted from 2030:,"Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.
"
3,19,225,Lily:,"Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.
"
3,19,226,Marshall:,"Man, birds do not get you.
"
3,19,227,Abby:,"Hi, sweetie.
"
3,19,228,Barney:,"Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?
"
3,19,229,Abby:,"No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?
"
3,19,230,Barney:,"Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.
"
3,19,231,Abby:,"So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.
"
3,19,232,Barney:,"Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.
"
3,19,233,Abby:,"What?
"
3,19,234,Barney:,"Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.
"
3,19,235,Abby:,"Really?
"
3,19,236,Barney:,"Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.
"
3,19,237,Abby:,"Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.
"
3,19,238,Barney:,"Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.
"
3,19,239,Marshall:,"Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com.
"
3,19,240,Lily:,"We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles
"
3,19,241,Marshall:,"You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.
"
3,19,242,Lily & Marshall:,"Thanks.
"
3,18,1,[Title:,"The Year 2030]
"
3,18,2,Narrator:,"Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life. (Cut to when Ted and Barney was in the limo) The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.
"
3,18,3,Barney:,"Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?
"
3,18,4,Ted:,"I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.
"
3,18,5,Ted:,"It's Barney. (To Barney, in the phone) Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.
"
3,18,6,"Barney (he is at work, in the phone):","Ted, I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls.
"
3,18,7,Ted:,"(in the phone) Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.
"
3,18,8,Barney:,"I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?
"
3,18,9,Ted:,"No I'm not.
"
3,18,10,Barney:,"Sh! Let it out, let it out.
"
3,18,11,Ted:,"Goodbye Barney. (He hangs up)
"
3,18,12,Lily:,"So are you two back together?
"
3,18,13,Ted:,"No.
"
3,18,14,Marshall:,"I miss Barney. I haven't ""high five"" with anyone like a week. I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.
"
3,18,15,Robin:,"Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me?
"
3,18,16,Lily:,"Yeah! She had just as much s*x with Barney as Barney had with her.
"
3,18,17,Robin:,"You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird.
"
3,18,18,Ted:,"I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. It's that's simple.
"
3,18,19,Lily:,"I will tell you why he is not mad. Because he is so happy with Stella.
"
3,18,20,Narrator:,"She was right. (We see videos of Stella and Ted) Stella and I had been dating for two months. And things were going really well. (Stella, Ted and his friends are playing) She had mat my friend in past for flying colors. There was just one little problem.
"
3,18,21,Lily:,"You guys haven't had s*x yet!!?? When Marshall and I were two months, we were doing it 24/7.
"
3,18,22,Ted:,"I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games.
"
3,18,23,Lily:,"So what you guys waiting for?
"
3,18,24,Ted:,"I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow.
"
3,18,25,Marshall:,"Wait, so you haven't had s*x since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then.
"
3,18,26,Lily:,"Oh baby, do you remember Martin Luther King day?
"
3,18,27,Marshall:,"Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.
"
3,18,28,Ted:,"Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing?
"
3,18,29,Randy:,"Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?
"
3,18,30,Barney:,"No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.
"
3,18,31,Randy:,"Assistant under secretary of only ok. Thank you, I will not let you down.
"
3,18,32,Narrator:,"So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.
"
3,18,33,Barney:,"(in the phone) Pitt, Barney Stinson!
"
3,18,34,Pitt:,"Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while.
"
3,18,35,Barney:,"Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight.
"
3,18,36,Pitt:,"You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter.
"
3,18,37,Barney:,"So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? (They both hang up)
"
3,18,38,Barney:,"Starry Porten, Barney Stinson.
"
3,18,39,Starry:,"What up, chef?
"
3,18,40,Barney:,"I need a new bro, what do you say?
"
3,18,41,Starry:,"Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan.
"
3,18,42,Barney:,"Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. (He hangs up)
"
3,18,43,Barney:,"Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson.
"
3,18,44,Willie:,"What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?
"
3,18,45,Barney:,"Yes finally!
"
3,18,46,Willie:,"Here is what on the rocket tocket. My wife is gonna put the cheese out at seven, scrabble at 8:00 PM, 9 PM we watch 27 dresses, everybody's home by 11:00. Booya! (Barney hangs up and he remakes a phone call to Willie)
"
3,18,47,Willie:,"Hello?
"
3,18,48,Barney:,"Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. (And then Barney hangs up)
"
3,18,49,Stella:,"So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere.
"
3,18,50,Ted:,"Let's have s*x. Right now, I'll lock the door.
"
3,18,51,Stella:,"Oh, there is no lock on that door.
"
3,18,52,Ted:,"We can do it against the door. It'll be hot! It'll be like a three-way: you, me and the door.
"
3,18,53,Stella:,"Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird between me and the door tomorrow.
"
3,18,54,Ted:,"I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.
"
3,18,55,Stella:,"You've been so patient Ted. The truth is... I'm kind of nervous. I have a confession to make.
"
3,18,56,Ted:,"I was afraid of this. You're 14.
"
3,18,57,Stella:,"No, um... it's kind of embarrassing, but it's been a while since I was intimate with anyone.
"
3,18,58,Ted:,"Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.
"
3,18,59,Stella:,"Really? How long it's been for you?
"
3,18,60,Ted:,"It's been a while.
"
3,18,61,Stella:,"Tell me.
"
3,18,62,Stella:,"Me too!
"
3,18,63,Ted:,"It's been five months for you too?
"
3,18,64,All (except Ted):,"Five years!!??
"
3,18,65,Marshall:,"Wow. Stella hasn't had s*x since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had s*x, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.
"
3,18,66,Lily:,"Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.
"
3,18,67,Marshall:,"The last time Stella had s*x, the world was just learning about SARS.
"
3,18,68,Robin:,"Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?
"
3,18,69,Stella:,"Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to.
"
3,18,70,Ted:,"But nobody in five years?
"
3,18,71,Stella:,"Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs.
"
3,18,72,Ted:,"In my defense, they were staring at me.
"
3,18,73,Lily:,"So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?
"
3,18,74,Ted:,"Actually...
"
3,18,75,Stella:,"But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all.
"
3,18,76,Ted:,"Your pillow talk's a little rusty.
"
3,18,77,Stella:,"You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready.
"
3,18,78,Ted:,"That's great. Like ""right now"" ready? (She laughs)
"
3,18,79,Ted:,"So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.
"
3,18,80,Marshall:,"The last time Stella had s*x, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.
"
3,18,81,Robin:,"Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.
"
3,18,82,Marshall:,"Not the movie, the book.
"
3,18,83,Robin:,"Wow.
"
3,18,84,Ted:,"It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?
"
3,18,85,Lily:,"You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...
"
3,18,86,Lily:,"(V.O.) It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. (There is a shock. And Lily likes the sensation which that gets her.)
"
3,18,87,Lily:,"Oh, San Francisco!
"
3,18,88,Ted:,"I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.
"
3,18,89,Marshall (watching on Internet):,"Notable deaths in 2003... Oh my God... Nell Carter. Did you guys know that Nell Carter had died?
"
3,18,90,Ted:,"I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.
"
3,18,91,Robin:,"Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.
"
3,18,92,Ted:,"Not Nell Carter... Stella.
"
3,18,93,Marshall:,"Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?
"
3,18,94,Ted:,"Because you're dead inside?
"
3,18,95,Marshall:,"No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite: lower expectations.
"
3,18,96,Ted:,"Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.
"
3,18,97,Marshall (in the phone):,"Hey, buddy. I'm married, Barney, I cannot be your new wingman. (Marshall hangs up, then Robin's phone rings, she picks up the phone and say directly...)
"
3,18,98,Robin:,"No. (And hangs up)
"
3,18,99,Barney:,"Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute? (Randy releases a box. And comes in Barney's office by running) Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?
"
3,18,100,Randy:,"Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back. (Then he goes in the lane, and dances. He comes back.) Tomorrow works.
"
3,18,101,Ted:,"I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.
"
3,18,102,Stella:,"Fancy?
"
3,18,103,Ted:,"Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever. (He eats the potato skin) Huh. That's surprising.
"
3,18,104,Stella:,"What?
"
3,18,105,Ted:,"This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.
"
3,18,106,Stella:,"Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?
"
3,18,107,Ted:,"No.
"
3,18,108,Stella:,"Quick on the draw?
"
3,18,109,Ted:,"No.
"
3,18,110,Stella:,"Unexpected number of testicules?
"
3,18,111,Ted:,"No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel. (She laughs)
"
3,18,112,Stella:,"Virginity 2: Eletric Boogaloo?
"
3,18,113,Ted:,"Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.
"
3,18,114,Stella:,"Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs. (They kiss each other)
"
3,18,115,Ted:,"""Unexpected number of testicules?""
"
3,18,116,Stella:,"It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. (They laugh)
"
3,18,117,Barney:,"Hey.
"
3,18,118,Randy:,"What up bro-seph Lieberman?
"
3,18,119,Barney:,"No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word ""bro"" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.
"
3,18,120,Randy:,"(He takes out his memo pad) Goodbye ""Geraldine Ferrar-bro"".
"
3,18,121,Barney:,"You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.
"
3,18,122,Randy:,"What a loser.
"
3,18,123,Barney:,"But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.
"
3,18,124,Randy:,"Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.
"
3,18,125,Barney:,"Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. (Barney wants to pick up two young woman)
"
3,18,126,Randy:,"Ok.
"
3,18,127,Barney:,"You ready?
"
3,18,128,Randy:,"Yes. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, no!
"
3,18,129,Barney:,"What? What's the matter?
"
3,18,130,Randy:,"Nothing, let's do this. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!
"
3,18,131,Barney:,"Randy what are you doing?
"
3,18,132,Randy:,"Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!
"
3,18,133,Barney:,"(Finally Randy is ready, so Barney goes talking to the girls) Hey, laddies. Have you met... (He points the finger towards Randy and turns around. But Randy hid under a table.)
"
3,18,134,Ted:,"Hey.
"
3,18,135,Stella:,"Hey.
"
3,18,136,Ted:,"So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...
"
3,18,137,Stella:,"Ted. Five years.
"
3,18,138,Ted:,"Straight to the hotel?
"
3,18,139,Stella:,"Straight to the hotel.
"
3,18,140,Ted:,"I'll get my bag. (Ted go to his bedroom)
"
3,18,141,Stella:,"Hey, guys.
"
3,18,142,Lily:,"Hey.
"
3,18,143,Marshall:,"Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight?
"
3,18,144,Stella:,"Yeah. Definitly. It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.
"
3,18,145,Lily:,"Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a ""night out"".
"
3,18,146,Marshall:,"This one wakes me up at 4am sometimes just to have a little night out.
"
3,18,147,Stella:,"Um, what are you guys talking about?
"
3,18,148,Lily:,"Nothing. Pizza. What are you talking about?
"
3,18,149,Ted:,"Hey guys.
"
3,18,150,Stella:,"Ted, you told them, didn't you?
"
3,18,151,Ted:,"Told them what?
"
3,18,152,Stella:,"You told them that I haven't had s*x in five years. (She seems embarrassing)
"
3,18,153,Marshall:,"You haven't had s*x in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!
"
3,18,154,Ted:,"Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.
"
3,18,155,Stella:,"Ted, that was so personal. Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.
"
3,18,156,Ted:,"No, they don't.
"
3,18,157,Stella:,"Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having s*x.
"
3,18,158,Barney:,"13 years??!!
"
3,18,159,Randy:,"I peaked really young.
"
3,18,160,Stella:,"That's why it was difficult for me to tell you. But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.
"
3,18,161,Ted:,"You can trust me.
"
3,18,162,Stella:,"Obviously, I can't. You know there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy, and you just gave me yours.
"
3,18,163,Ted:,"Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?
"
3,18,164,Stella:,"Why would be looking for one?
"
3,15,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me. Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work. So I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends.
"
3,15,2,Ted:,"A new car!
"
3,15,3,Barney:,"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!
"
3,15,4,Robin:,"You can't call shotgun for eternity.
"
3,15,5,Barney:,"I just called it.
"
3,15,6,Robin:,"You can't just call things, barney.
"
3,15,7,Barney:,"I call that I can call things!
"
3,15,8,Lily:,"Hey, baby.
"
3,15,9,Marshall:,"Beer.
"
3,15,10,Lily:,"Are you okay?
"
3,15,11,Marshall:,"Beer.
"
3,15,12,Ted:,"Okay, what happened?
"
3,15,13,Marshall:,"They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war...
"
3,15,14,Marshall:,"..You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...
"
3,15,15,Man:,"Dude, we're lawyers now.
"
3,15,16,Marshall:,"Totally.
"
3,15,17,Man:,"We've got briefcases and everything.
"
3,15,18,Marshall:,"Freakin' briefcases.
"
3,15,19,Man:,"You have anything in yours?
"
3,15,20,Marshall:,"Totally empty. you?
"
3,15,21,Man:,"Candy bars.
"
3,15,22,Marshall:,"Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...
"
3,15,23,Arthur:,"Hey, Marshall....
"
3,15,24,Marshall:,"..the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.
"
3,15,25,Marshall:,"Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... Artillery arthur.
"
3,15,26,Arthur:,"How's your morning going?
"
3,15,27,Marshall:,"It's going fine. How is yours?
"
3,15,28,Arthur:,"Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet?
"
3,15,29,Marshall:,"He is, he's in... just in his office next door.
"
3,15,30,Arthur:,"That's great... have a good one, buddy.
"
3,15,31,Marshall:,"You, too. (Arthur leaves Marshall's office) You never know who's gonna get hit...
"
3,15,32,Arthur:,"Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!
"
3,15,33,Marshall:,"It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.
"
3,15,34,Ferguson:,"Did you hear that?
"
3,15,35,Marshall:,"Yeah, sorry.
"
3,15,36,Ferguson:,"Can you believe he did that On ""Take-your-daughter-to-work"" day?
"
3,15,37,Marshall:,"So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...""
"
3,15,38,Ted:,"Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?
"
3,15,39,Marshall:,"Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in ""the ninja report"" yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...
"
3,15,40,Arthur:,"Hey, Ferguson.
"
3,15,41,Ferguson:,"Hey, Arthur.
"
3,15,42,Arthur:,"How's your day going?
"
3,15,43,Marshall:,"I gotta go.
"
3,15,44,Ferguson:,"Great. how is yours?
"
3,15,45,Arthur:,"Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet?
"
3,15,46,Ferguson:,"Oh, thank god. Yeah, he's right in there.
"
3,15,47,Arthur:,"Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.
"
3,15,48,Marshall:,"And then...
"
3,15,49,Marshall:,"He screamed at me.
"
3,15,50,Lily:,"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.
"
3,15,51,Barney:,"What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?
"
3,15,52,Marshall:,"Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.
"
3,15,53,Ted:,"Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?
"
3,15,54,Barney:,"I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.
"
3,15,55,Lily:,"Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.
"
3,15,56,Robin:,"Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.
"
3,15,57,Marshall:,"Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.
"
3,15,58,Ted:,"All of what?
"
3,15,59,Marshall:,"All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!
"
3,15,60,Marshall:,"I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...
"
3,15,61,Barney:,"Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.
"
3,15,62,Barney:,"Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.
"
3,15,63,Marshall:,"I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.
"
3,15,64,Robin:,"Is ""boy"" the right word?
"
3,15,65,Marshall:,"I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.
"
3,15,66,Lily:,"God, you're hot right now.
"
3,15,67,Marshall:,"And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.
"
3,15,68,Barney:,"Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.
"
3,15,69,Marshall:,"How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?
"
3,15,70,Robin:,"Here's what I would do if I were you.
"
3,15,71,Robin:,"Hi, Arthur.
"
3,15,72,Arthur:,"Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?
"
3,15,73,Robin:,"Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.
"
3,15,74,Arthur:,"Please, I have a family.
"
3,15,75,Robin:,"So we good?
"
3,15,76,Arthur:,"We're so good.
"
3,15,77,Robin:,"Then why are you still in my office?
"
3,15,78,Ted:,"Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.
"
3,15,79,Marshall:,"Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.
"
3,15,80,Ted:,"Observe.
"
3,15,81,Ted:,"Arthur?
"
3,15,82,Arthur:,"What do you want, Marshall?
"
3,15,83,Ted:,"Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.
"
3,15,84,Arthur:,"You are nailing this.
"
3,15,85,Ted:,"Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...
"
3,15,86,Arthur:,"You got me hooked, reel me in.
"
3,15,87,Ted:,"There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.
"
3,15,88,Arthur:,"Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.
"
3,15,89,Marshall:,"Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.
"
3,15,90,Ted:,"Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?
"
3,15,91,Marshall:,"It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.
"
3,15,92,Barney:,"Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.
"
3,15,93,Barney:,"Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.
"
3,15,94,Bilson:,"You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...
"
3,15,95,Blauman:,"You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.
"
3,15,96,Barney:,"Oh, snap.
"
3,15,97,Bilson:,"What?
"
3,15,98,Blauman:,"You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?
"
3,15,99,Ted:,"Oh, my God.
"
3,15,100,Marshall:,"He peed on the conference table?
"
3,15,101,Blauman:,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.
"
3,15,102,"Barney, pouring some water in a glass:","Does this help?
"
3,15,103,Barney:,"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.
"
3,15,104,Marshall:,"That's it? that's the end of the story?
"
3,15,105,Barney:,"No, no, of course not... he died.
"
3,15,106,Marshall:,"How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?
"
3,15,107,Barney:,"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.
"
3,15,108,Marshall:,"Chain of screaming?
"
3,15,109,Barney:,"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.
"
3,15,110,Ted:,"I thought it was a chain of screaming.
"
3,15,111,Barney:,"It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.
"
3,15,112,Marshall:,"I don't scream at Lily.
"
3,15,113,Lily:,"And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.
"
3,15,114,Robin:,"So it's not a circle.
"
3,15,115,Barney:,"Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?
"
3,15,116,Marshall:,"Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?
"
3,15,117,Lily:,"Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...
"
3,15,118,Barney:,"Oh, God.
"
3,15,119,Lily:,"..When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.
"
3,15,120,Lily:,"Hello, Arthur.
"
3,15,121,Arthur:,"Hello, Marshall.
"
3,15,122,Lily:,"I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.
"
3,15,123,Arthur:,"Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.
"
3,15,124,Lily:,"Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?
"
3,15,125,Arthur:,"Oh, yeah.
"
3,15,126,Lily:,"I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...
"
3,15,127,Arthur:,"That's it.
"
3,15,128,Lily:,"..just throw her on the bed...
"
3,15,129,Arthur:,"That's where she belongs.
"
3,15,130,Lily:,"..and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!
"
3,15,131,Lily:,"It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.
"
3,15,132,Marshall:,"You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?
"
3,15,133,Lily:,"I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...
"
3,15,134,Marshall:,"o, the other part, please.
"
3,15,135,Lily:,"I have the ninja report right here, but...
"
3,15,136,Ted from 2030:,"And it seemed like that was the end of it, but it wasn't, because the next night...
"
3,15,137,Lily:,"Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.
"
3,15,138,Ted:,"Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?
"
3,15,139,Marshall:,"Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.
"
3,15,140,Ted:,"Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?
"
3,15,141,Marshall:,"Not good, not good at all.
"
3,15,142,Ted:,"Where are you right now?
"
3,15,143,Marshall:,"Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.
"
3,15,144,Ted:,"Okay, I'll see you soon.
"
3,15,145,Marshall:,"I love you.
"
3,15,146,Ted:,"I love you, too.
"
3,15,147,Lily:,"Wow, you two are already saying the ""l"" word, huh?
"
3,15,148,Ted:,"Apparently.
"
3,15,149,Lily:,"You hitting that?
"
3,15,150,Marshall:,"I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.
"
3,15,151,Ted:,"Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...
"
3,15,152,Marshall:,"I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.
"
3,15,153,Ted:,"It's just, this is a really good parking spot.
"
3,15,154,Marshall:,"Dude!
"
3,15,155,Ted:,"Look, just tell me what happened first.
"
3,15,156,Marshall:,"Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.
"
3,15,157,Ted:,"There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?
"
3,15,158,Marshall:,"After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.
"
3,15,159,Barney:,"Hey, marshall.
"
3,15,160,Marshall:,"How long have you been sitting there?
"
3,15,161,Barney:,"If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?
"
3,15,162,Marshall:,"Yeah, I was just about to order.
"
3,15,163,Barney:,"What do you want?
"
3,15,164,Marshall:,"A sandwich and gravy fries.
"
3,15,165,Waiter:,"Okay, friends, what do you like?
"
3,15,166,Barney:,"A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.
"
3,15,167,Waiter:,"Very good.
"
3,15,168,Marshall:,"No, I didn't want meatloaf.
"
3,15,169,Barney:,"Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.
"
3,15,170,Marshall:,"No, I don't.
"
3,15,171,Barney:,"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.
"
3,15,172,Marshall:,"Who would I even scream at?
"
3,15,173,Barney:,"I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.
"
3,15,174,Marshall:,"No.
"
3,15,175,Robin:,"Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?
"
3,15,176,Marshall:,"Oh, I was just telling Ted a story.
"
3,15,177,Robin:,"Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?
"
3,15,178,Ted:,"Is that ice cream cone big enough?
"
3,15,179,Robin:,"Uh, it's delicious enough.
"
3,15,180,Marshall:,"Okay, so... Then I say to Barney...
"
3,15,181,Marshall:,"I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.
"
3,15,182,Barney:,"Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.
"
3,15,183,Waiter:,"One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.
"
3,15,184,Barney:,"Marshall.
"
3,15,185,Marshall:,"Excuse me?
"
3,15,186,Waiter:,"Yes?
"
3,15,187,Marshall:,"This is not what I ordered.
"
3,15,188,Waiter:,"Yes, it is.
"
3,15,189,Marshall:,"I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so...
"
3,15,190,Waiter:,"No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!
"
3,15,191,Barney:,"Hey, what are you guys doing out here?
"
3,15,192,Robin:,"Oh sweet, can I get a toot?
"
3,15,193,Ted:,"Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!
"
3,15,194,Barney:,"Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.
"
3,15,195,Ted:,"Well, that's just not true.
"
3,15,196,Barney:,"Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.
"
3,15,197,Robin:,"ou can't call shotgun for eternity.
"
3,15,198,Barney:,"Well, that's funny, cause I did!
"
3,15,199,Robin:,"t's case by case.
"
3,15,200,Marshall:,"Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!
"
3,15,201,Barney:,"A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?
"
3,15,202,Marshall:,"I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...
"
3,15,203,Barney:,"I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.
"
3,15,204,Marshall:,"What?
"
3,15,205,Barney:,"Yell at me.
"
3,15,206,Marshall:,"I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.
"
3,15,207,Barney:,"What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot.
"
3,15,208,Marshall:,"Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?
"
3,15,209,Barney:,"Yeah.
"
3,15,210,Marshall:,"This is me yelling at you, Barney.
"
3,15,211,Barney:,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.
"
3,15,212,Marshall:,"This is me yelling at you, Barney!
"
3,15,213,Barney:,"Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.
"
3,15,214,Marshall:,"You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!
"
3,15,215,Barney:,"No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.
"
3,15,216,Marshall:,"Your mom's a slut!
"
3,15,217,Barney:,"Yes.
"
3,15,218,Marshall:,"Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!
"
3,15,219,Barney:,"Keep going.
"
3,15,220,Marshall:,"I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!
"
3,15,221,Barney:,"Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.
"
3,15,222,Marshall:,"Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...
"
3,15,223,Barney:,"No, I'm kidding... keep going.
"
3,15,224,Marshall:,"Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be...
"
3,15,225,Marshall:,".. I quit, Arthur! I quit!
"
3,15,226,Arthur:,"Well, thank you, Eriksen, I needed to hear that.
"
3,15,227,Marshall:,"Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i...
"
3,15,228,Arthur:,"No, no, no, the part where you said, ""I quit."" Now we don't have to pay you a severance package. Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.
"
3,15,229,Ted:,"Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...
"
3,15,230,Marshall:,"Dude!
"
3,15,231,Ted:,"I'm sorry.
"
3,15,232,Barney:,"Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.
"
3,15,233,Marshall:,"How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?
"
3,15,234,Ted:,"Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!
"
3,15,235,Barney:,"Ted, screaming never solves anything.
"
3,15,236,Ted from 2030:,"And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.
"
3,15,237,Marshall:,"I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back.
"
3,15,238,Lily:,"No, you're not.
"
3,15,239,Marshall:,"What?
"
3,15,240,Lily:,"Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.
"
3,15,241,Marshall:,"I love you.
"
3,15,242,Lily:,"I love you, too.
"
3,15,243,Ted from 2030:,"Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet without going bust on the apartment.
"
3,15,244,Marshall:,"You sure about this?
"
3,15,245,Ted:,"Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?
"
3,15,246,Marshall:,"Ted, I don't think I can accept...
"
3,15,247,Ted:,"Marshall, don't make me scream at you.
"
3,15,248,Marshall:,"Thanks a lot, buddy.
"
3,15,249,Ted:,"You guys did it in the car, didn't...
"
3,15,250,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah!

"
3,1,17,Lily:,"Robin!
"
3,1,18,Robin:,"Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael.
"
3,1,19,Gael:,"Hola.
"
3,1,20,Ted:,"Okay, I'm ready.
"
3,1,21,Ted:,"I just can't believe her. (He walks into the room with only his chin shaved) We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy? You know what she's doing? She's trying to win the breakup.
"
3,1,22,Lily:,"What do you mean ""Win the breakup"", old timey inventor.
"
3,1,23,Marshall:,"What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers.
"
3,1,24,Lily:,"It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition.
"
3,1,25,Marshall:,"That's my wife.
"
3,1,26,Barney:,"Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?
"

"
3,1,31,Gael:,"Gael.
"
3,1,32,Marshall:,"Girl?
"
3,1,33,Robin:,"It's pronounced ""guy-el"".
"
3,1,34,Gael:,"It's means ""joyful"". That is why I live my life by bringing joy, good energy and happiness to others. Especially those less fortunate that I.
"
3,1,35,Ted:,"I'm sorry. So it's Gayle?
"
3,1,36,Ted:,"(With only a mustache now) What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.
"
3,1,37,Barney:,"That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.
"
3,1,38,Ted:,"And, oh, he is a masseuse.
"
3,1,39,Gael:,"With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your heartbeat.
"
3,1,40,Ted:,"One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it.
"
3,1,41,Gael:,"Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.
"
3,1,42,Barney:,"How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.
"
3,1,43,Barney:,"Not possible. You cannot have s*x on a windsurfing board.
"
3,1,44,Lily:,"How do you know?
"
3,1,45,Barney:,"Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have s*x. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had s*x in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.
"
3,1,46,Lily:,"To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.
"
3,1,47,Barney:,"This conversation never happened.
"
3,1,48,Ted:,"All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.
"
3,1,49,Barney:,"Yes!
"
3,1,50,Ted:,"You guys, have fun of your duble date.
"
3,1,51,Lily:,"Oh, for the hundredth time, I'm sorry, there was a lull.
"
3,1,52,Gael:,"And then we fell asleep on the beach while counting the stars.
"
3,1,53,Lily:,"Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us?
"
3,1,54,Marshall:,"There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot.
"
3,1,55,Lily:,"No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy.
"
3,1,56,Marshall:,"Well, you did.
"
3,1,57,Lily:,"I'm one of the lucky few.
"
3,1,58,Marshall:,"Lily, Ted is our best friend, so let's get something straight: Male Gayle is not hot. He's not our friend. Don't even look at him. Just... no eye contact.
"
3,1,59,Narrator:,"So that night, as Lily and Marshall did their best to hate Gael...
"
3,1,60,Lily:,"Hey, Robin. (Looks down) Gael.
"

3,1,63,Ted:,"""I just want to make sure you're okay with this""? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?
"
3,1,64,Barney:,"Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah.

"
3,1,70,Lily:,"I do not! Shut up! Oh, my God!
"
3,1,71,Robin:,"I just hope Ted's okay.
"
3,1,72,Marshall:,"Hmm.
"
3,1,73,Gael:,"I hate to see you so tense. (Begins massaging her) I mean, we had a really clean break up, you know? We really acted like adults, so the last thing... Oh! Oh, God, oh!

"
3,1,75,Gael:,"What?
"
3,1,76,Marshall:,"Are you legally certified by some type of gouverning entity?

3,14,16,Ted:,"That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.
"
3,14,17,Barney:,"Your team lost 20 minutes ago.
"
3,14,18,Ted:,"I didn't know they were playing today.
"
3,14,19,Lily:,"You okay, Barney?
"
3,14,20,Barney:,"Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.
"
3,14,21,Robin:,"Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?
"
3,14,22,Barney:,"There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.
"
3,14,23,Robin:,"Of course there are.
"
3,14,24,Barney:,"Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.
"
3,14,25,Lily:,"You could not be more evil.
"
3,14,26,Barney:,"Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...
"
3,14,27,Barney:,"Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.
"
3,14,28,Barney:,"I was only gone for a second when...
"
3,14,29,Barney:,"See? Skid-proof.
"
3,14,30,Barney:,"The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.
"
3,14,31,Marshall:,"Pet store?
"
3,14,32,Ted:,"Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.
"
3,14,33,Barney:,"God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog.
"
3,14,34,Ted:,"I'm really bored at work.
"
3,14,35,Barney:,"I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.
"
3,14,36,Woman:,"Oh, I want to take her home right now.
"
3,14,37,Barney:,"Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?
"
3,14,38,"Woman, slapping him:","Jerk!
"
3,14,39,Barney:,"Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.
"
3,14,40,Lily:,"Ooh, ooh, ooh!
"
3,14,41,Barney:,"Lily.
"
3,14,42,Lily:,"You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.
"
3,14,43,Barney:,"No. Marshall.
"
3,14,44,Marshall:,"You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!
"
3,14,45,Barney:,"Oh. No. Robin.
"
3,14,46,Robin:,"You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.
"
3,14,47,Barney:,"Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...
"
3,14,48,Barney:,"At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left.
"
3,14,49,Woman:,"I'm so sorry.
"
3,14,50,Barney:,"My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.
"
3,14,51,Barney:,"Why does this keep happening?
"
3,14,52,Lily:,"Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.
"
3,14,53,Barney:,"Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.
"
3,14,54,Ted from 2030:,"But the next night got even weirder.
"
3,14,55,Barney:,"Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.
"
3,14,56,Lily:,"You never gonna believe what just happened.
"
3,14,57,Barney:,"Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?
"
3,14,58,Lily:,"Alan Alda?
"
3,14,59,Barney:,"No.
"
3,14,60,Mystery woman:,"Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life.
"
3,14,61,Barney:,"Oh, my God. Where is she?
"
3,14,62,Lily:,"She must have left. She...
"
3,14,63,Barney:,"Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?
"
3,14,64,Lily:,"She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.
"
3,14,65,Barney:,"Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?
"
3,14,66,Lily:,"Yes!
"
3,14,67,Barney:,"That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!
"
3,14,68,Barney:,"Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?
"
3,14,69,Lily:,"It's karma.
"
3,14,70,Barney:,"Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.
"
3,14,71,Ted:,"Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?
"
3,14,72,Barney:,"My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.
"
3,14,73,Marshall:,"I have one. It's called my marriage license.
"
3,14,74,Ted:,"Come on, let's see the list.
"
3,14,75,Barney:,"Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.
"
3,14,76,Barney:,"This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?
"
3,14,77,Lily:,"I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face.
"
3,14,78,Ted:,"How many of these girls know they're being photographed?
"
3,14,79,Barney:,"All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.
"
3,14,80,Lily:,"Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you.
"
3,14,81,Robin:,"Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.
"
3,14,82,Barney:,"Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.
"
3,14,83,Lily:,"I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.
"
3,14,84,Barney:,"This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?
"
3,14,85,Barney:,"The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.
"
3,14,86,Lily:,"Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!
"
3,14,87,Lily:,"The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.
"
3,14,88,Robin:,"It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!
"
3,14,89,Ted:,"It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!
"
3,14,90,Robin:,"Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!
"
3,14,91,Barney:,"Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.
"
3,14,92,"Marshal, Lily and Ted:","12 hours to live!
"
3,14,93,Robin:,"Damn it!
"
3,14,94,Barney:,"Okay, toss up. ""Thought I was Jorge Posada,"" or ""You have my dead wife's kidney?""
"
3,14,95,Ted:,"Kidney!
"
3,14,96,Robin:,"Jorge Posada!
"
3,14,97,Lily:,"She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!
"
3,14,98,Barney:,"That's true...
"
3,14,99,Marshall:,"It's ""Dead wife's kidney."" How are we even discussing this?
"
3,14,100,Lily:,"Fake baby!
"
3,14,101,Marshall:,"Lost at sea!
"
3,14,102,Ted:,"Fake baby!
"
3,14,103,Marshall:,"Lost at sea!
"
3,14,104,Ted:,"I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.
"
3,14,105,Barney:,"Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, ""Girl who thought I owned Google,"" up against the number seven seed, ""Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.""
"
3,14,106,Ted:,"You got to go scuba instructor.
"
3,14,107,Robin:,"You're kidding me!
"
3,14,108,Ted:,"She got the bends!
"
3,14,109,Barney:,"Yeah, she did.
"
3,14,110,Marshall:,"Evil twin!
"
3,14,111,Ted:,"Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!
"
3,14,112,Robin:,"Barney, you're the tiebreaker.
"
3,14,113,Barney:,"I'm going with Evil Twin.
"
3,14,114,Ted:,"You're kidding me!
"
3,14,115,Barney:,"Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.
"
3,14,116,Robin:,"Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.
"
3,14,117,Lily:,"Is that the blackboard from my classroom?
"
3,14,118,Barney:,"Come on! Marshall?
"
3,14,119,Marshall:,"I'm tired and sad.
"
3,14,120,Barney:,"Mosby?
"
3,14,121,Ted:,"I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.
"
3,14,122,Barney:,"Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.
"
3,14,123,Lily:,"You guys stole my blackboard!
"
3,14,124,Barney:,"Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.
"
3,14,125,Lily:,"No.
"
3,14,126,Barney:,"What do you mean ""no""?
"
3,14,127,Lily:,"That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, ""I'm sorry.""
"
3,14,128,Barney:,"Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.
"
3,14,129,Lily:,"Barney, you're doing this.
"
3,14,130,Barney:,"Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!
"
3,14,131,Lily:,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?
"
3,14,132,Barney:,"If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.
"
3,14,133,Meg:,"What are you doing here?
"
3,14,134,Barney:,"Look, Meg, we need to talk.
"
3,14,135,Meg:,"It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.
"
3,14,136,Barney:,"And I forgive you. I love you.
"
3,14,137,Meg:,"Oh, my God! I love you, too!
"
3,14,138,Lily:,"No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...
"
3,14,139,Barney:,"So you remember who this one is, right?
"
3,14,140,Lily:,"Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.
"
3,14,141,Barney:,"Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...
"
3,14,142,Lily:,"Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.
"
3,14,143,Barney:,"Ah, there she is.
"
3,14,144,Lily:,"Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.
"
3,14,145,Barney:,"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
"
3,14,146,Lily:,"I'm making a scrapbook.
"
3,14,147,Barney:,"Anna, hi.
"
3,14,148,Anna:,"Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.
"
3,14,149,Barney:,"What Web site?
"
3,14,150,Anna:,"Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.
"
3,14,151,Barney:,"You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.
"
3,14,152,Ted from 2030:,"And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!
"
3,14,153,Lily:,"Okay, which one is this again?
"
3,14,154,Barney:,"She's...
"
3,14,155,Kate:,"Larney! Die!
"
3,14,156,Barney:,"Is it her?
"
3,14,157,Kate:,"Die!
"
3,14,158,Lily:,"Smile.
"
3,14,159,Barney:,"You look good. Have you lost weight?
"
3,14,160,Barney:,"We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.
"
3,14,161,Holly:,"Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!
"
3,14,162,Lily:,"That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.
"
3,14,163,Barney:,"But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.
"
3,14,164,Lily:,"She's gonna kill you.
"
3,14,165,Holly:,"Barney.
"
3,14,166,Barney:,"Holly.
"
3,14,167,Holly:,"Mark, come over here. Barney, this is my fiancé. Mark.
"
3,14,168,Mark:,"Barney? You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?
"
3,14,169,Lily:,"So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?
"
3,14,170,Holly:,"No, whatever happened was in the past. Mark is my present and my future.
"
3,14,171,Mark:,"And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.
"
3,14,172,Barney:,"Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.
"
3,14,173,Mark:,"Fourth of July? We started dating in June.
"
3,14,174,Lily:,"We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.
"
3,14,175,Barney:,"No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.
"
3,14,176,Robin:,"Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.
"
3,14,177,Barney:,"That's not a bad idea.
"
3,14,178,Robin:,"I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.
"
3,14,179,Ted:,"I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.
"
3,14,180,Robin:,"I do not.
"
3,14,181,Ted:,"Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?
"
3,14,182,Robin:,"No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.
"
3,14,183,Barney:,"I'm in.
"
3,14,184,Robin:,"Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...
"
3,14,185,Robin:,"..she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.
"
3,14,186,Barney:,"Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!
"
3,14,187,Robin:,"And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.
"
3,14,188,Man:,"Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful.
"
3,14,189,Robin:,"I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.
"
3,14,190,Barney:,"Hey, there, how are you doing?
"
3,14,191,Robin:,"Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.
"
3,14,192,Barney:,"Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?
"
3,14,193,Robin:,"Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.
"
3,14,194,Barney:,"It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.
"
3,14,195,Robin:,"You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?
"
3,14,196,Barney:,"Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?
"
3,14,197,Robin:,"No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.
"
3,14,198,Barney:,"Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x.
"
3,14,199,Ted:,"Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.
"
3,14,200,Marshall:,"I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? (Barney joins them at the booth) Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?
"
3,14,201,Barney:,"I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.
"
3,14,202,Marshall:,"Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.
"
3,14,203,Ted:,"Are you okay?
"
3,14,204,Barney:,"I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.
"
3,14,205,Lily:,"Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.
"
3,14,206,Barney:,"What? What?
"
3,14,207,Robin:,"Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.
"
3,14,208,Barney:,"So I apologized for nothing?
"
3,14,209,Lily:,"Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo ""Barney's Redemption."" Could you stop giving me the finger?
"
3,14,210,Ted from 2030:,"Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later.
"
3,14,211,Woman:,"Barney, come back to bed. You have a shuttle launch tomorrow. And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan, It's not gonna destroy itself.
"
3,2,1,[Title:,"The Year 2007]
"
3,2,2,Ted:,"So, beeing married, different? Not different?
"
3,2,3,Marshall:,"It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.
"
3,2,4,Barney:,"I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.
"
3,2,5,Marshall:,"No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly.
"
3,2,6,Lily:,"Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...
"
3,2,7,Barney:,"Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?
"
3,2,8,Lily:,"It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly.
"
3,2,9,Marshall:,"It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location.
"
3,2,10,Lily:,"Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round.
"
3,2,11,Ted:,"Thanks.
"
3,2,12,Marshall:,"I am such a jerk.
"
3,2,13,Barney:,"Yeah. Wait, why?
"
3,2,14,Marshall:,"I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.
"
3,2,15,Ted:,"Marshall brownies.
"
3,2,16,Marshall:,"Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.
"
3,2,17,Barney:,"That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.
"
3,2,18,Ted:,"Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.
"
3,2,19,Barney:,"No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...
"
3,2,20,Marshall:,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what? It didn't work. So, there.
"
3,2,21,Marshall:,"You guys are jerks!

3,2,24,Robin:,"I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before.

3,2,32,Lily:,"Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.
"
3,2,33,Barney:,"You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker.
"
3,2,34,Lily:,"Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.
"
3,2,35,Barney:,"What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.

"
3,2,39,Robin:,"I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.
"
3,2,40,Barney:,"Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a ""Best if banged by"" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being ""Unevolved Robin"", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.

3,2,41,Ted:,"I'm just happy Robin's happy.
"
3,2,42,Barney:,"I'm telling you, within three days...

"
3,2,53,Barney:,"That guy...
"
3,2,54,Ted:,"Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.
"
3,2,55,Barney:,"Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?
"
3,2,56,Ted:,"He's better looking than us.
"
3,2,57,Barney:,"No. Because he's from out of town.
"
3,2,58,Ted:,"Mmm.
"
3,2,59,Ted:,"Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.
"
3,2,60,Barney:,"Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?
"
3,2,61,Ted:,"Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.

"
3,2,71,Colleen:,"No, what is it?
"
3,2,72,Ted:,"Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.
"
3,2,73,Barney:,"Yeah.
"
3,2,74,Lindsay:,"Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? Atfer lunch?
"
3,2,75,Barney:,"Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?
"
3,2,76,Colleen:,"It's kind of a lame bar, but sure.
"

"
3,2,78,Lindsay:,"It's pretty lame.

"
3,2,99,Robin:,"And you know what else? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from?
"
3,2,100,Lily:,"Well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip.
"
3,2,101,Robin:,"But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow.
"
3,2,102,Robin:,"Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me?
"
3,2,103,A guy (but he's not Gael):,"Don't mind if I do, love.
"
3,2,104,Robin:,"Gael, there's some weird du.. (A lot of people is on her apartment) Hello.
"
3,2,105,Gael:,"Hey. Good news. I made some travelling friends today, and they'll be staying with us. How do you say... indefinetly?!

"
3,2,107,[The Apartment - Lily/Marshall]Lily:,"Oh, here. Will you sign this thank you note?
"
3,2,108,Marshall:,"Wow. Both sides. You wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box.
"
3,2,109,Lily:,"Wow, it's a really nice blender.
"
3,2,110,Marshall:,"Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it.
"
3,2,111,Lily:,"I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong?
"
3,2,112,Marshall:,"Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong? Except that when you die, I'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were ""Cancel Vogue"".
"
3,2,113,Lily:,"How can you open my letter?
"
3,2,114,Marshall:,"That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.
"
3,2,115,Lily:,"Marshall, wait. (He opens the door) This was our first fight as a married couple.
"
3,2,116,Marshall:,"Oh, baby.

"
3,2,133,Barney:,"Yes, we do.
"
3,2,134,Robin:,"Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. G.F.H.L. number two ; Marijuana is illegal in the United States, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a TV Newscaster. ""This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand?"" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I... (All cherring). (Yelling) And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked.

3,2,135,Barney:,"Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. (Barney and Colleen laughing)
"
3,2,136,Ted:,"Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson.
"
3,2,137,Barney:,"(scoffing) Now he knows all the streets. Someone's been watching too many ""Steinfield reruns"". (Woman laughing, Ted laughts sarcastically)

3,2,142,Ted:,"There were three of them, at least two guns... they took all our money.
"

"
3,2,146,Marshall:,"I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet.
"
3,2,147,Lily:,"Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead.
"
3,2,148,Marshall:,"You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter?
"
3,2,149,Lily:,"Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter.
"
3,2,150,Marshall:,"Really?
"
3,2,151,Lily:,"Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again.
"
3,2,152,Marshall:,"Lily, I won't, I promise.
"
3,2,153,Lily:,"Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder.

"

"
3,2,180,Ted:,"Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to ""pretty much New York""? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!

3,16,39,Marshall:,"And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy?
"
3,16,40,Lily:,"Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you?
"
3,16,41,Robin:,"I have no idea what you' talking about.
"
3,16,42,Ted:,"Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.
"
3,16,43,Robin:,"Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.
"
3,16,44,Barney:,"You're starting out with two big ones right there.
"
3,16,45,Robin:,"Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.
"
3,16,46,Ted:,"Point Robin.
"
3,16,47,Robin:,"Um, he never became a rock star.
"
3,16,48,Lily:,"Point Robin.
"
3,16,49,Robin:,"He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa.
"
3,16,50,Marshall:,"Point Simon.
"
3,16,51,Ted:,"Wait. Do they have a wave pool?
"
3,16,52,Robin:,"No.
"
3,16,53,Marshall:,"Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.
"
3,16,54,Robin:,"Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.
"
3,16,55,Ted from 2030:,"And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody.
"
3,16,56,Simon:,"Hey, babe.
"
3,16,57,"Robin, giggling:","Oh, my God.
"
3,16,58,Ted:,"Okay, what the hell just happened?
"
3,16,59,Robin:,"Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?
"
3,16,60,Robin:,"Hey, Simon.
"
3,16,61,Simon:,"Wow, look at you. You got old.
"
3,16,62,Robin:,"Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.
"
3,16,63,Robin:,"So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.
"
3,16,64,Simon:,"Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good thing I'm packing.
"
3,16,65,Robin:,"So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.
"
3,16,66,Marshall:,"The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.
"
3,16,67,Lily:,"So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.
"
3,16,68,Robin:,"No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.
"
3,16,69,Barney:,"I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?
"
3,16,70,Simon:,"Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park.
"
3,16,71,Ted:,"Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.
"
3,16,72,Simon:,"Yeah, it is... because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going... Go.. Go... Go... people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it.
"
3,16,73,Ted:,"Um... (clears his throat)... okay. Go.
"
3,16,74,Simon:,"You didn't put your hand up; kid just died.
"
3,16,75,Ted:,"No, I didn't know...
"
3,16,76,Simon:,"Another kid just went; he died too.
"
3,16,77,Ted:,"Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...
"
3,16,78,Simon:,"Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in: My friend, Ted, just killed a bunch of kids today.
"
3,16,79,Lily:,"Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?
"
3,16,80,Simon:,"Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding.
"
3,16,81,Robin:,"The Foreskins are still playing?
"
3,16,82,Ted:,"The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?
"
3,16,83,Simon:,"Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously.
"
3,16,84,Robin:,"I know. I'm sorry.
"
3,16,85,Robin:,"I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.
"
3,16,86,Barney:,"Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.
"
3,16,87,Barney:,"So, Simon, how did you guys meet?
"
3,16,88,Simon:,"Oh, I was in her video.
"
3,16,89,Robin:,"Starred in it is more like it.
"
3,16,90,Simon:,"Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.
"
3,16,91,Barney:,"I'm sorry. I've seen ""Let's Go to the Mall"" about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.
"
3,16,92,Simon:,"No, I was in the other one.
"
3,16,93,Barney:,"There's another video?!
"
3,16,94,Barney:,"Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.
"
3,16,95,Robin:,"No.
"
3,16,96,Barney:,"All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.
"
3,16,97,Robin:,"Okay.
"
3,16,98,Marshall:,"It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.
"
3,16,99,Robin:,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.
"
3,16,100,Ted:,"Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.
"
3,16,101,Marshall:,"It's called ""revertigo.""
"
3,16,102,Ted:,"Yeah, I don't know about ""revertigo.""
"
3,16,103,Marshall:,"You know who gets really bad revertigo? (whispers) Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.
"
3,16,104,Barney:,"Michelle? She sounds hot.
"
3,16,105,Ted:,"You don't know about Lily and Michelle?
"
3,16,106,Barney:,"No. What about Lily and Michelle?
"
3,16,107,Marshall:,"Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?
"
3,16,108,Lily:,"What?
"
3,16,109,Marshall:,"You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.
"
3,16,110,Lily:,"Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.
"
3,16,111,Barney:,"What... (stammers) Do they make out?
"
3,16,112,Marshall:,"Better.
"
3,16,113,Ted:,"Comparable.
"
3,16,114,Marshall:,"Comparable.
"
3,16,115,Robin:,"Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.
"
3,16,116,Robin:,"I got a second chance.
"
3,16,117,Lily:,"What happened?
"
3,16,118,Robin:,"He came by my place tonight...
"
3,16,119,Robin:,"Simon. What are you doing here?
"
3,16,120,Simon:,"I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.
"
3,16,121,Robin:,"Oh, I like where this is going.
"
3,16,122,Simon:,"I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date?
"
3,16,123,Lily:,"He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.
"
3,16,124,Ted:,"The coup de grace.
"
3,16,125,Barney:,"Finish him!
"
3,16,126,Robin:,"I'd love to!
"
3,16,127,Ted:,"Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?
"
3,16,128,Lily:,"Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.
"
3,16,129,Robin:,"That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?
"
3,16,130,Lily:,"Oh, hell, no!
"
3,16,131,Marshall:,"I think you're gonna enjoy this.
"
3,16,132,Lily:,"That my girl Michelle?
"
3,16,133,Michelle:,"Bitch, you know it!
"
3,16,134,Lily:,"How she livin'?
"
3,16,135,Michelle:,"She living only way she know how to. Large!
"
3,16,136,Lily:,"Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.
"
3,16,137,Michelle:,"I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.
"
3,16,138,Lily:,"For reals.
"
3,16,139,Barney:,"I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.
"
3,16,140,Robin:,"Yeah!
"
3,16,141,Simon:,"Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you?
"
3,16,142,Robin:,"That rocked.
"
3,16,143,Simon:,"Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.
"
3,16,144,Robin:,"Oh, uh, sure.
"
3,16,145,Simon:,"Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later.
"
3,16,146,Robin:,"Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.
"
3,16,147,Simon:,"Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show.
"
3,16,148,Robin:,"Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.
"
3,16,149,Simon:,"Right. So you can be, like ""Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out."" And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs.
"
3,16,150,Robin:,"And now it's time for ""Puppy Corner,"" some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.
"
3,16,151,Robin:,"Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them.
"
3,16,152,Marshall:,"Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.
"
3,16,153,Lily:,"What's revertigo?
"
3,16,154,Ted:,"It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.
"
3,16,155,Marshall:,"No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.
"
3,16,156,Lily:,"Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.
"
3,16,157,Marshall:,"You do?
"
3,16,158,Lily:,"Yeah. Ted.
"
3,16,159,Ted:,"Me?
"
3,16,160,Lily:,"Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.
"
3,16,161,Ted:,"Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.
"
3,16,162,Ted:,"Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?
"
3,16,163,Punchy:,"'Sup, Shmosby?!
"
3,16,164,Ted:,"You want to go?
"
3,16,165,Punchy:,"I'm already there!
"
3,16,166,Ted:,"Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.
"
3,16,167,Punchy:,"eah, it was a real shock.
"
3,16,168,Ted:,"I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.
"
3,16,169,Lily:,"Why?
"
3,16,170,Ted:,"No reason.
"
3,16,171,Marshall:,"Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?
"
3,16,172,Robin:,"Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.
"
3,16,173,Lily:,"Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.
"
3,16,174,Robin:,"You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?
"
3,16,175,Lily:,"I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?
"
3,16,176,Robin:,"That's exactly what my mom would say.
"
3,16,177,Lily:,"No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, ""We forbid you from seeing this boy.""
"
3,16,178,Robin:,"Lily!
"
3,16,179,Lily:,"No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.
"
3,16,180,Robin:,"This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!
"
3,16,181,Marshall:,"Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.
"
3,16,182,Robin:,"Yeah, like, a billion years ago.
"
3,16,183,Lily:,"You've been drinking, haven't you?
"
3,16,184,Robin:,"Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.
"
3,16,185,Lily:,"You're not going to that show tonight!
"
3,16,186,Robin:,"Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.
"
3,16,187,Lily:,"Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.
"
3,16,188,Ted:,"Hey, so, today at work...
"
3,16,189,Marshall:,"Not now, Ted!
"
3,16,190,Ted:,"Geez.
"
3,16,191,Robin:,"Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.
"
3,16,192,Simon:,"Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?!
"
3,16,193,Robin:,"God, I just love seeing you so happy.
"
3,16,194,Simon:,"Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over.
"
3,16,195,Robin:,"What?
"
3,16,196,Simon:,"I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.
"
3,16,197,"Robin, laughing:","What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason?
"
3,16,198,Ted:,"Well... I'm sorry, Robin.
"
3,16,199,Robin:,"I'm fine, really.
"
3,16,200,Lily:,"Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?
"
3,16,201,Michelle:,"Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub.
"
3,16,202,Lily:,"Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.
"
3,16,203,Ted:,"So, how's Columbia?
"
3,16,204,Michelle:,"Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology.
"
3,16,205,Robin:,"Um, can I make an observation?
"
3,16,206,Michelle:,"Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon.
"
3,16,207,Marshall:,"Revertigo?
"
3,16,208,Michelle:,"o. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!
"
3,16,209,Ted from 2030:,"One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.
"
3,16,210,Barney:,"All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?
"
3,16,211,Robin:,"Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.
"
3,16,212,Barney:,"Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.
"
3,16,213,Robin:,"No, tonight.
"
3,16,214,Barney:,"Ooh. Really? (Robin starts crying)Oh! Oh, come here.
"
3,16,215,Robin:,"It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.
"
3,16,216,Barney:,"Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.
"
3,16,217,Robin:,"Right. Of course, the-the first being you.
"
3,16,218,Barney:,"No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.
"
3,16,219,Robin:,"Barney, do you want to come back to my place?
"
3,16,220,Barney:,"Your place?
"
3,16,221,Barney:,"Are you sure you want to do this?
"
3,16,222,Robin:,"Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?
"
3,16,223,Barney:,"Of course. So, should I just put it in?
"
3,16,224,Robin:,"Yeah, why not?
"
3,16,225,Robin:,"This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked.
"
3,16,226,Barney:,"Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.
"
3,16,227,Robin:,"Oh, I'm so glad.
"
3,16,228,Barney:,"Is that Alan Thicke?
"
3,16,229,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
3,16,230,Barney:,"You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?
"
3,16,231,Robin:,"Yeah, you're right. I was lame.
"
3,16,232,Barney:,"Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.
"
3,16,233,Robin:,"He was my sidekick. He had to be.
"
3,16,234,Ted from 2030:,"And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally... (Robin and Barney kiss) they stopped watching.
"
3,17,1,Ted from 2030:,"Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed.
"
3,17,2,Barney:,"In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.
"
3,17,3,Robin:,"Check.
"
3,17,4,Barney:,"Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.
"
3,17,5,Robin:,"And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?""
"
3,17,6,Barney:,"Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend
"
3,17,7,Robin:,"And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.
"
3,17,8,Barney:,"Best friend.
"
3,17,9,Robin:,"Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.
"
3,17,10,Barney:,"Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.
"
3,17,11,Robin:,"Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.
"
3,17,12,Barney:,"Okay. Right. So, Robin?
"
3,17,13,Robin:,"Yes, Barney?
"
3,17,14,Barney:,"Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?
"
3,17,15,Robin:,"I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.
"
3,17,16,Barney:,"Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.
"
3,17,17,Ted from 2030:,"But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy.
"
3,17,18,Ted:,"So, tell us, what was it like?
"
3,17,19,Barney:,"What?
"
3,17,20,Ted:,"Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.
"
3,17,21,Barney:,"I... I... I'm... I'm...
"
3,17,22,Marshall:,"Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.
"
3,17,23,Robin:,"Yeah, you are.
"
3,17,24,Marshall:,"Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.
"
3,17,25,Lily:,"It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.
"
3,17,26,Barney:,"What are you talking about?!
"
3,17,27,Ted:,"The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?
"
3,17,28,Barney:,"Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin?
"
3,17,29,Robin:,"I'm good.
"
3,17,30,Ted:,"Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?
"
3,17,31,Barney:,"Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?
"
3,17,32,Ted:,"Liking video games?
"
3,17,33,Robin:,"I'm gonna get a drink.
"
3,17,34,Barney:,"I'll come with you.
"
3,17,35,Robin:,"Okay.
"
3,17,36,Barney:,"God, this is awkward.
"
3,17,37,Robin:,"What is?
"
3,17,38,Barney:,"Being around Ted.
"
3,17,39,Robin:,"Why?
"
3,17,40,Barney:,"Because of our thing.
"
3,17,41,Robin:,"What thing?
"
3,17,42,Barney:,"You're really gonna pretend this never happened?
"
3,17,43,Ted:,"What never happened? What are you guys talking about?
"
3,17,44,Robin:,"Nothing.
"
3,17,45,Ted:,"Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.
"
3,17,46,Barney:,"Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.
"
3,17,47,Marshall:,"Hello.
"
3,17,48,Barney:,"Hey, Marshall, I need your help.
"
3,17,49,Marshall:,"Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.
"
3,17,50,Barney:,"I know. I want to hire you.
"
3,17,51,Marshall:,"For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.
"
3,17,52,Barney:,"I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.
"
3,17,53,Marshall:,"How much?
"
3,17,54,Barney:,"A little.
"
3,17,55,Marshall:,"I'll take it.
"
3,17,56,Marshall:,"Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal.
"
3,17,57,Barney:,"Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?
"
3,17,58,Marshall:,"Of course. Why are you upset?
"
3,17,59,Barney:,"Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.
"
3,17,60,Marshall:,"No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...
"
3,17,61,Barney:,"You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept... (Marshall covers his ears with his hands and starts singing) Stop..stop doing that. (Barney throws a bowling ball at him, Marshall catches it) I slept... I slept with Robin.
"
3,17,62,Marshall:,"You slept with Robin?
"
3,17,63,Barney:,"Are you mad at me?
"
3,17,64,Marshall:,"I don't know.
"
3,17,65,Barney:,"How's the hot dog?
"
3,17,66,Marshall:,"It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.
"
3,17,67,Barney:,"You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.
"
3,17,68,Marshall:,"Why are you doing this to me?!
"
3,17,69,Barney:,"Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.
"
3,17,70,Marshall:,"How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?
"
3,17,71,Barney:,"I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.
"
3,17,72,Ted from 2030:,"For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic.
"
3,17,73,Barney:,"Bro Code article one:""Bros before hoes.""
"
3,17,74,Ted from 2030:,"Some were unbelievably complicated.
"
3,17,75,Barney:,"Bro Code article 89: ""The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and/or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing.""
"
3,17,76,Ted from 2030:,"And some were just plain disturbing.
"
3,17,77,Barney:,"Bro Code article 34: ""Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."" Two dudes.
"
3,17,78,Marshall:,"This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.
"
3,17,79,Barney:,"You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?
"
3,17,80,Barney:,"The year was 1776. The place: Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.
"
3,17,81,Benjamin:,"But, bro, seriously, I called the dibs on that wench. You codpiece blocked me.
"
3,17,82,George:,"So what if I did? There's no rule against it.
"
3,17,83,Benjamin:,"Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros.
"
3,17,84,George:,"But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.
"
3,17,85,Benjamin:,"And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.
"
3,17,86,Barney:,"I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.
"
3,17,87,George:,"It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code.
"
3,17,88,Barney:,"And I shall l include a provision that stateth ""No eye contact in a devil's three-way.""
"
3,17,89,Benjamin:,"Seconded.
"
3,17,90,George:,"Seconded.
"
3,17,91,Marshall:,"Listen, what do you want me for?
"
3,17,92,Barney:,"I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?
"
3,17,93,Marshall:,"Yeah, because you slept with Robin.
"
3,17,94,Barney:,"No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.
"
3,17,95,Marshall:,"And you would pay me for that?
"
3,17,96,Barney:,"No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.
"
3,17,97,Marshall:,"Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?
"
3,17,98,Barney:,"Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!
"
3,17,99,Ted from 2030:,"While Marshall examined the Bro Code, Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.
"
3,17,100,Lily:,"And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?
"
3,17,101,Frank:,"You got it, toots.
"
3,17,102,Lily:,"Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.
"
3,17,103,Girl:,"Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?
"
3,17,104,Frank:,"Oh! Ah, isn't that sweet! Well, you know, honey, right after this, I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop. And they're going to take a great big knife...
"
3,17,105,Ted from 2030:,"And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from... So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.
"
3,17,106,Girl:,"Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.
"
3,17,107,Lily:,"I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday.
"
3,17,108,Ted:,"Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?
"
3,17,109,Lily:,"I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof.
"
3,17,110,Ted:,"Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.
"
3,17,111,Ted from 2030:,"And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat would go on to do in that bathroom was so... No, you know what? I'm m getting ahead of myself. We'll get there.
"
3,17,112,Robin:,"Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?
"
3,17,113,Ted:,"How'd you know that was a goat turd?
"
3,17,114,Robin:,"Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?
"
3,17,115,Ted:,"Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.
"
3,17,116,Marshall:,"Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.
"
3,17,117,Ted:,"Talk about what?
"
3,17,118,Marshall:,"Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?
"
3,17,119,Ted:,"How does everyone know that's a goat turd?
"
3,17,120,Robin:,"Barney told you.
"
3,17,121,Marshall:,"I don't know what you're talking about,madam.
"
3,17,122,Robin:,"Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking.
"
3,17,123,Ted:,"Robin, come here!
"
3,17,124,Robin:,"Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.
"
3,17,125,Barney:,"Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.
"
3,17,126,Marshall:,"I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.
"
3,17,127,Barney:,"No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.
"
3,17,128,Marshall:,"I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87: ""A bro shall at all times say yes.""
"
3,17,129,Woman:,"So he saved you from an avalanche?
"
3,17,130,Ted:,"Yes.
"
3,17,131,Woman:,"And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?
"
3,17,132,Ted:,"Yes.
"
3,17,133,Woman:,"And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer who used to be a member of the Russian mob?
"
3,17,134,Ted:,"Da.
"
3,17,135,Marshall:,"Article 29 ""A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight.""
"
3,17,136,Ted:,"Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.
"
3,17,137,Barney:,"What?!
"
3,17,138,Ted:,"Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.
"
3,17,139,Barney:,"Hey.
"
3,17,140,Marshall:,"Article 53: ""A bro will, whenever possible, provide his bro with protection.""
"
3,17,141,Woman:,"That feels nice.
"
3,17,142,Barney:,"Good.
"
3,17,143,Woman:,"I just wish we had some wine.
"
3,17,144,Barney:,"Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.
"
3,17,145,Barney:,"Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!
"
3,17,146,Marshall:,"Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.
"
3,17,147,Barney:,"What if he never wants to talk to me again?
"
3,17,148,Marshall:,"Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take.
"
3,17,149,Ted from 2030:,"Which brings us to April 25, 2008. My 30th birthday, or as it would come to be referred to in later years: The Day of the Goat.
"
3,17,150,Lily:,"Hey, where are you?
"
3,17,151,Barney:,"'m in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.
"
3,17,152,Lily:,"Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...
"
3,17,153,Barney:,"Goat in a party hat?
"
3,17,154,Lily:,"Damn it! Well, you still gotta see it. It's so much fun having a goat at a party!
"
3,17,155,Ted from 2030:,"In a few short hours, Lily would come to regret those words. But we'll get there.
"
3,17,156,Barney:,"h, gotta go. Here he comes.
"
3,17,157,Lily:,"Okay. Bye.
"
3,17,158,Ted:,"Whoa, you guys went all out.
"
3,17,159,Lily:,"Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are!
"
3,17,160,Ted:,"Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?
"
3,17,161,Barney:,"Vegas.
"
3,17,162,Ted:,"Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.
"
3,17,163,Barney:,"Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.
"
3,17,164,Ted:,"So there's no roof party?
"
3,17,165,Barney:,"Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!
"
3,17,166,Ted:,"Take me home, Barney.
"
3,17,167,Barney:,"No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.
"
3,17,168,Ted:,"You slept with Robin.
"
3,17,169,Ranjit:,"You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!
"
3,17,170,Barney:,"When did you find out?
"
3,17,171,Ted:,"Hey, Robin. Come here!
"
3,17,172,Robin:,"What's up?
"
3,17,173,Ted:,"I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...
"
3,17,174,Marshall:,"Oh, crap!
"
3,17,175,Ted:,"Anyway, uh, I came across this.
"
3,17,176,Robin:,"From my vacacation in Vermont.
"
3,17,177,Ted:,"Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.
"
3,17,178,Robin:,"I slept with Barney!
"
3,17,179,Ted:,"What?
"
3,17,180,Robin:,"It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends.
"
3,17,181,Ted:,"Of course we can still be friends.
"
3,17,182,Robin:,"So you're not mad?
"
3,17,183,Ted:,"Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.
"
3,17,184,Barney:,"So you're not mad?
"
3,17,185,Ted:,"No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.
"
3,17,186,Barney:,"I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
"
3,17,187,Ted:,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!
"
3,17,188,Marshall:,"Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.
"
3,17,189,Lily:,"Marshall, can we keep the goat?
"
3,17,190,Marshall:,"No.
"
3,17,191,Lily:,"But she's so cute and furry and soft.
"
3,17,192,Marshall:,"Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels.
"
3,17,193,Lily:,"Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?
"
3,17,194,Robin:,"Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house.
"
3,17,195,Lily:,"Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.
"
3,17,196,Robin:,"Marshall!
"
3,17,197,Marshall:,"I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore.
"
3,17,198,Lily:,"I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing?
"
3,17,199,Robin:,"What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.
"
3,17,200,Lily:,"I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff?
"
3,17,201,Robin:,"Lily,come on.
"
3,17,202,Lily:,"Hot wax?
"
3,17,203,Marshall:,"Stop it.
"
3,17,204,Lily:,"Did he tie you to anything?
"
3,17,205,Marshall:,"That's enough. What's wrong with you?
"
3,17,206,Lily:,"I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?
"
3,17,207,Ted:,"Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!
"
3,17,208,Barney:,"You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened.
"
3,17,209,Ted:,"How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.
"
3,17,210,Barney:,"You mean... what position? (They starts fighting) Stop it! Stop it!
"
3,17,211,Ranjit:,"Hit him!
"
3,17,212,Barney:,"Ted! Stop!
"
3,17,213,Ranjit:,"Hit him!
"
3,17,214,Barney:,"Stop!
"
3,17,215,Ranjit:,"Hit him!
"
3,17,216,Barney:,"Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face. (Ted hits him where it hurts the most...) Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?
"
3,17,217,Ted:,"You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, ""don't do this""?
"
3,17,218,Barney:,"Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...
"
3,17,219,Ted:,"I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled ""stuff I have no use for anymore.""
"
3,17,220,Barney:,"What does that mean?
"
3,17,221,Ted:,"It means... maybe you belong in that box.
"
3,17,222,Barney:,"Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?
"
3,17,223,Ted:,"I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.
"
3,17,224,Barney:,"Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.
"
3,17,225,Ted:,"Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.
"
3,17,226,Everyone:,"Surprise!
"
3,17,227,Ted from 2030:,"Oh, right, the goat. So funny.You're going to love this. So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom and was eating one of Robin's washcloths and wait, hold on. Robin wasn't living here on my 30th birthday. When did this happen? Oh, wait, the goat was there on my 31st birthday. Sorry, I totally got that wrong.
"
3,3,1,Future Ted:,"Kids, I know you think that you've heard every story from back before I met your mother. But there are some stories you tell and some stories you don't.
"
3,3,2,Ted:,"Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.
"
3,3,3,Barney:,"Use your words, Ted.
"
3,3,4,Ted:,"OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.
"
3,3,5,Barney:,"The belt?
"
3,3,6,Ted:,"The belt.
"
3,3,7,Barney:,"But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.
"
3,3,8,Marshall:,"Yes, advantage Ericksen.
"
3,3,9,Barney:,"Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.
"
3,3,10,Marshall:,"Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.
"
3,3,11,Ted:,"All right, I'm ready, let's hit it.
"
3,3,12,Marshall:,"Can't go. Tournament.
"
3,3,13,Ted:,"What? We agreed, I suited up.
"
3,3,14,Barney:,"You take too long to get ready
"
3,3,15,Ted:,"What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.
"
3,3,16,Marshall:,"Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.
"
3,3,17,Barney:,"And then he starts on his hair. Ace.
"
3,3,18,Ted:,"Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?
"
3,3,19,Barney:,"Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.
"
3,3,20,Ted:,"Really?
"
3,3,21,"Barney, Marshall:","Yes.
"
3,3,22,Ted:,"All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.
"
3,3,23,Ted:,"(holding up appropriate number of fingers) 3 beers, 5 minutes.
"
3,3,24,Robin:,"Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?
"
3,3,25,Lily:,"Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy.
"
3,3,26,Lily:,"I saw it first.
"
3,3,27,Lily:,"You just made the list, bitch.
"
3,3,28,Barney:,"So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?
"
3,3,29,Lily:,"You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?
"
3,3,30,Robin:,"Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.
"
3,3,31,Barney:,"FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.
"
3,3,32,Marshall:,"Shekwakie.
"
3,3,33,Barney:,"Stinson.
"
3,3,34,Ted:,"All right, the beers are here.
"
3,3,35,Barney:,"Yeah, we're not gonna make it.
"
3,3,36,Ted:,"Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?
"
3,3,37,Barney:,"Yeah, pants are off.
"
3,3,38,Marshall:,"This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio.
"
3,3,39,Ted:,"Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer.
"
3,3,40,Trudy:,"Ted.
"
3,3,41,Trudy:,"Trudy.
"
3,3,42,Ted:,"Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...
"
3,3,43,Trudy:,"I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape?
"
3,3,44,Ted:,"That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me.
"
3,3,45,Ted:,"No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed.
"
3,3,46,Trudy:,"You were embarrassed? I was like, I really like this guy and now I'm climbing out his window.
"
3,3,47,Trudy:,"And I forgot my underwear.
"
3,3,48,Ted:,"Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding.
"
3,3,49,Trudy:,"I am so glad I ran into you.
"
3,3,50,Ted:,"I know, do you wanna get a...
"
3,3,51,Rachel:,"Trudy, no way!
"
3,3,52,Trudy:,"Oh my God, Rachel, how are you?
"
3,3,53,Trudy:,"Ted, this is Rachel.
"
3,3,54,Rachel:,"Hi.
"
3,3,55,"Rachel, Trudy:","Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Whoo!
"
3,3,56,Ted:,"Let me guess, you guys met in prison.
"
3,3,57,Rachel:,"No, we're sorority sisters.
"
3,3,58,Trudy:,"And best friends forever, all sophomore year.
"
3,3,59,Rachel:,"When we weren't at each other's throats.
"
3,3,60,Trudy:,"We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now.
"
3,3,61,Rachel:,"(singing and dancing) Hey, mista...
"
3,3,62,"Rachel, Trudy:","(Trudy joins in singing and dancing)... hey mista, stay away from my sista.
"
3,3,63,Trudy:,"We have so much catching up do to.
"
3,3,64,Rachel:,"OK, are you going to Stacy's wedding?
"
3,3,65,Trudy:,"Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes.
"
3,3,66,Rachel:,"No! Again? That's like her third one.
"
3,3,67,Trudy:,"I know.
"
3,3,68,Ted:,"Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.
"
3,3,69,Rachel:,"So, Trudy and I got a table.
"
3,3,70,Ted:,"Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.
"
3,3,71,Rachel:,"But I want you to stay.
"
3,3,72,Ted:,"Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.
"
3,3,73,Ted:,"OK, guys, be cool.
"
3,3,74,Marshall:,"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.
"
3,3,75,Barney:,"That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.
"
3,3,76,Barney:,"Stinson.
"
3,3,77,Ted:,"I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.
"
3,3,78,Barney:,"You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.
"
3,3,79,Ted:,"So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.
"
3,3,80,Barney:,"So you now have two on the line?
"
3,3,81,Ted:,"And I don't know which one to go for.
"
3,3,82,Barney:,"Go for the new girl.
"
3,3,83,Barney:,"Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.
"
3,3,84,Lily:,"New girl? What new girl?
"
3,3,85,Barney:,"Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...
"
3,3,86,Lily:,"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me.
"
3,3,87,Lily:,"Are they friends? (Ted on phone)
"
3,3,88,Ted:,"Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.
"
3,3,89,Lily:,"Are they Betas?
"
3,3,90,Lily:,"Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway.
"
3,3,91,Ted:,"They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.
"
3,3,92,Lily:,"OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out.
"
3,3,93,Marshall:,"I thought we were in for the evening.
"
3,3,94,Barney:,"That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.
"
3,3,95,Trudy:,"Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?
"
3,3,96,Ted:,"Well, that's very complicated.
"
3,3,97,Rachel:,"See, he agrees with me. You're such a little man-thief.
"
3,3,98,Trudy:,"You're the man-thief, man-thief.
"
3,3,99,Ted:,"Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.
"
3,3,100,Trudy:,"You're so funny. I think Ted is funny.
"
3,3,101,Rachel:,"Really? I think Ted is hilarious.
"
3,3,102,Ted:,"(muttering to himself) I am never not wearing a suit again.
"
3,3,103,Ted:,"Hello.
"
3,3,104,Lily:,"It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.
"
3,3,105,Ted:,"Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?
"
3,3,106,Lily:,"What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.
"
3,3,107,Ted:,"They are? Are you sure?
"
3,3,108,Lily:,"Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.
"
3,3,109,Ted:,"Are you positive?
"
3,3,110,Robin:,"That is so fascinating. So what happened?
"
3,3,111,Robin's date:,"Well, after eighteen hours of surgery, I closed and thankfully both girls just celebrated their second birthday.
"
3,3,112,Robin:,"Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.
"
3,3,113,Robin's date:,"True, but now the parents don't know what to do with their huge supply of four-legged overalls.
"
3,3,114,Robin:,"That is so funny. You are so funny.
"
3,3,115,Lily:,"Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.
"
3,3,116,Lily:,"Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.
"
3,3,117,Ted:,"Bye mom.
"
3,3,118,Ted:,"My mom.
"
3,3,119,Lily:,"Hello.
"
3,3,120,Robin:,"Bring me a razor.
"
3,3,121,Lily:,"What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions?
"
3,3,122,Robin:,"They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.
"
3,3,123,Lily:,"No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving...
"
3,3,124,Robin:,"Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.
"
3,3,125,Lily:,"I'm on my way.
"
3,3,126,Ted:,"So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?
"
3,3,127,Trudy:,"Neither of us.
"
3,3,128,Rachel:,"He left, junior year abroad.
"
3,3,129,Trudy:,"It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do.
"
3,3,130,Rachel:,"We were gonna do, but never did.
"
3,3,131,Ted:,"What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.
"
3,3,132,Rachel:,"No, It's too embarrassing. You tell him.
"
3,3,133,Trudy:,"No, you tell him.
"
3,3,134,Rachel:,"I don't care if you don't care.
"
3,3,135,Trudy:,"I don't care.
"
3,3,136,Ted:,"Nobody cares, just say it.
"
3,3,137,Rachel:,"Why don't we tell him together?
"
3,3,138,Trudy:,"OK, on three.
"
3,3,139,Trudy:,"One.
"
3,3,140,Lily:,"Well, he's right, it's a dead heat.
"
3,3,141,Trudy:,"Two.
"
3,3,142,Lily:,"Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel.
"
3,3,143,Trudy:,"Three
"
3,3,144,Ted:,"It's a tricycle.
"
3,3,145,Barney:,"No way, no way, no way!
"
3,3,146,Marshall:,"What's happening?
"
3,3,147,Ted:,"It's a tricycle.
"
3,3,148,Marshall:,"No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle.
"
3,3,149,Lily:,"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.
"
3,3,150,Barney:,"Put him on speaker.
"
3,3,151,Barney:,"So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?
"
3,3,152,Marshall:,"Wait wait wait, what belt?
"
3,3,153,Ted:,"Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.
"
3,3,154,Marshall:,"Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?
"
3,3,155,(flashback to Barney removing a large belt from a box) Barney:,"Behold.
"
3,3,156,Ted:,"You actually bought a belt.
"
3,3,157,Barney:,"That's right, it's resplendent.
"
3,3,158,Ted:,"It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.
"
3,3,159,Barney:,"I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...
"
3,3,160,Marshall:,"Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.
"
3,3,161,Marshall:,"If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.
"
3,3,162,Lily:,"If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s.
"
3,3,163,Ted:,"Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?
"
3,3,164,Barney:,"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?
"
3,3,165,Ted:,"Yes.
"
3,3,166,Barney:,"Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.
"
3,3,167,Ted:,"Yes.
"
3,3,168,Barney:,"Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?
"
3,3,169,Ted:,"What? No.
"
3,3,170,Barney:,"Ted?
"
3,3,171,Ted:,"No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.
"
3,3,172,Ted:,"Oh, are you guys leaving?
"
3,3,173,Rachel:,"Well, it is getting pretty late.
"
3,3,174,Ted:,"Right, well...
"
3,3,175,Trudy:,"I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before.
"
3,3,176,Ted:,"Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.
"
3,3,177,Rachel:,"I'm sorry, where was your apartment again?
"
3,3,178,Ted:,"That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.
"
3,3,179,Marshall:,"Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, ""Please, don't, I love my dead wife,"" but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life.
"
3,3,180,Lily:,"Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle.
"
3,3,181,Marshall:,"I already did this morning.
"
3,3,182,Lily:,"Hello.
"
3,3,183,Robin:,"Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.
"
3,3,184,Lily:,"Sorry, I can't leave now.
"
3,3,185,Robin:,"Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian
"
3,3,186,Robin:,"There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?
"
3,3,187,Waitress:,"No, but fifty will.
"
3,3,188,Barney:,"Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me. (reading text) We're combing upsars.
"
3,3,189,Marshall:,"We're combing upsars? What does that mean?
"
3,3,190,Lily:,"He's coming upstairs!
"
3,3,191,Marshall:,"Where are my pants? Where's my pants!
"
3,3,192,Ted:,"Got 'em.
"
3,3,193,Rachel:,"Ooh, nice place!
"
3,3,194,Rachel:,"Hey, are these your roommates?
"
3,3,195,Ted:,"Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.
"
3,3,196,Rachel:,"You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music.
"
3,3,197,Ted:,"That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.
"
3,3,198,Rachel:,"OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble.
"
3,3,199,Trudy:,"Of course we can't promise anything.
"
3,3,200,Ted:,"This is gonna be awesome.
"
3,3,201,Ted:,"No!
"
3,3,202,Ted:,"What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...
"
3,3,203,Lily:,"We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.
"
3,3,204,Marshall:,"Yeah bro, up top.
"
3,3,205,Lily:,"Oh, don't be gross.
"
3,3,206,Ted:,"You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.
"
3,3,207,Marshall:,"No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.
"
3,3,208,Lily:,"Oh, you can use our bedroom.
"
3,3,209,Ted:,"OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.
"
3,3,210,Ted:,"What are you doing?
"
3,3,211,Barney:,"I cannot allow Ted to do this.
"
3,3,212,Ted:,"Why, why?
"
3,3,213,Barney:,"Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.
"
3,3,214,Marshall:,"But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.
"
3,3,215,Barney:,"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.
"
3,3,216,Barney:,"So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?
"
3,3,217,Blonde Girl:,"Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel.
"
3,3,218,Brunette Girl:,"OK.
"
3,3,219,Barney:,"I'll get the video camera.
"
3,3,220,Blonde Girl:,"Get out!
"
3,3,221,Barney:,"OK then.
"
3,3,222,Ted:,"Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...
"
3,3,223,Marshall:,"Tom Petty.
"
3,3,224,Ted:,"Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.
"
3,3,225,Ted:,"Where's Lily?
"
3,3,226,Ted:,"Still looking for that CD, so...
"
3,3,227,Ted:,"What are you doing?
"
3,3,228,Lily:,"I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.
"
3,3,229,Lily:,"I saw it first.
"
3,3,230,Lily:,"You just made the list, bitch.
"
3,3,231,Lily:,"I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.
"
3,3,232,Ted:,"Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.
"
3,3,233,Lily:,"No, never.
"
3,3,234,Ted:,"What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?
"
3,3,235,Lily:,"Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.
"
3,3,236,Ted:,"OK, take it.
"
3,3,237,Ted:,"Wish me luck.
"
3,3,238,Barney:,"Oh my God.
"
3,3,239,Robin:,"Where's the shaving cream?
"
3,3,240,Waitress:,"Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.
"
3,3,241,Robin:,"Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?
"
3,3,242,Waitress:,"Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?
"
3,3,243,Robin:,"Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?
"
3,3,244,Waitress:,"Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.
"
3,3,245,Robin's date:,"Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap?
"
3,3,246,Robin:,"Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?
"
3,3,247,Robin's date:,"Yeah.
"
3,3,248,Robin:,"You've gotta be kidding me.
"
3,3,249,Robin:,"Excuse me.
"
3,3,250,Ted:,"So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.
"
3,3,251,Rachel:,"That's OK, we don't need music to have fun.
"
3,3,252,Ted:,"Exactly.
"
3,3,253,Trudy:,"You do like to have fun, don't you Ted?
"
3,3,254,Ted:,"It's getting late, I'll get your coats.
"
3,3,255,Lily:,"I'll get your coats? Ted: I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on.
"
3,3,256,Marshall:,"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.
"
3,3,257,Barney:,"Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.
"
3,3,258,Lily:,"What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night.
"
3,3,259,Blonde Girl:,"So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?
"
3,3,260,Barney:,"Oh no, the night's ruined!
"
3,3,261,Brunette Girl:,"No, baby, it's not.
"
3,3,262,Barney:,"Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?
"
3,3,263,Marshall:,"Why would you do that to yourself?
"
3,3,264,Barney:,"Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.
"
3,3,265,Ted:,"See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?
"
3,3,266,Barney:,"The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.
"
3,3,267,Ted:,"It won't?
"
3,3,268,Barney:,"No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong. (laughs) Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.
"
3,3,269,Ted:,"Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.
"
3,3,270,"Trudy, Rachel:","Oh!
"
3,3,271,Ted:,"Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.
"
3,3,272,(back to present scene) Barney:,"Right, that's my apartment. Dressing gown's mine too. Damn, this should be me.
"
3,3,273,Rachel:,"I am so exhausted.
"
3,3,274,Trudy:,"So exhausted.
"
3,3,275,Ted:,"Why would I want to tire them out?
"
3,3,276,Barney:,"That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.
"
3,3,277,Rachel:,"You give the most amazing foot massage.
"
3,3,278,Ted:,"It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.
"
3,3,279,Ted:,"Why in God's name would I say that?
"
3,3,280,(back to present scene in Ted's room) Barney:,"It's endearing, you're a caregiver. Never take family values out of the equation.
"
3,3,281,Trudy:,"Ted, what's wrong?
"
3,3,282,Ted:,"I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.
"
3,3,283,Ted:,"OK, what the hell.
"
3,3,284,Barney:,"OK, wait for it.
"
3,3,285,Ted:,"Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.
"
3,3,286,Rachel:,"Oh my God.
"
3,3,287,Trucy:,"That's so true.
"
3,3,288,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
3,3,289,Ted:,"Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.
"
3,3,290,Barney:,"Yes you can.
"
3,3,291,Lily:,"I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.
"
3,3,292,Ted:,"All right.
"
3,3,293,Ted:,"I'll see you on the other side.
"
3,3,294,Barney:,"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.
"
3,3,295,Barney:,"What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.
"
3,3,296,Barney:,"You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?
"
3,3,297,Barney:,"You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!
"
3,3,298,Ted:,"Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.
"
3,3,299,Barney:,"Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?
"
3,3,300,Barney:,"Ted, belt.
"
3,3,301,(Barney lifts up belt) Barney:,"Did you? Did you? Or didn't you?
"
3,3,302,Barney:,"Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?
"
3,3,303,Robin's date:,"Oh hey. Will you go in there and see if my date's OK?
"
3,3,304,Waitress:,"No problem.
"
3,3,305,Waitress:,"No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open.
"
3,3,306,Robins' date:,"I guess I shouldn't be so surprised. I mean, she was acting weird all night, right? Waitress: Yeah. You know...
"
3,3,307,Waitress:,"Why don't I buy you a drink?
"

"
3,7,25,Marshall:,"Ted! How many times have i asked you to put the lid back on the peanut butter jar? (Ted wants to speak but Marshall goes on) It's this sort of incoiderate, immature jackassery that makes me feel like i'm living in the Realworld house, and not the early years when they all had jobs and social consciences. I'm talking about Hawaii and after! I can't take this anymore!

3,7,239,Marshall:,"No we're not getting divorced, not even on paper. Lily, when i married you, i married your problems too. The ones i knew about and the ones i didn't. So that was the deal, we'll figure this out together. (They kiss, the waitress comes)
"
3,7,240,"Wendy, upset, with a black eye:","Can i get you guys anything else?
"
3,7,241,Robin:,"So you're not getting a divorce?
"
3,7,242,Lily:,"No!
"
3,7,243,Ted:,"Wow, guys! You scared us.
"
3,7,244,Barney:,"Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold.
"
3,7,245,Robin:,"So what's the annoucement?
"
3,7,246,Marshall:,"I just got off the phone with the Realtor. We told her that, uh, because of our finances, we're not getting the place. It's just --it's not the right time.
"
3,7,247,Narrator:,"Is what Marshall should have said.
"
3,7,248,[Rewind] Marshall:,"I just got off the phone with the Realtor. we got the place!
"
3,7,249,Lily:,"We're home on earth!
"
3,7,250,The others:,"Are you insane?
"
3,7,251,Narrator:,"Is what we should have said.
"
3,7,252,Together:,"Yeah!! (They hug each other)
"
3,7,253,Marshall:,"Ow this is exciting!
"
3,7,254,Lily:,"Yeah! There it is! Our new home!
"
3,7,255,Marshall:,"Shall we?
"
3,7,256,Lily:,"We shall.
"
3,7,257,Lily:,"Oh! what a horrible smell.
"
3,7,258,Marshall:,"It reeks!
"
3,7,259,Cab driver:,"Oh, that's just the plant. Don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends.
"
3,7,260,Lily:,"Wh-what plant? What are you talking about?
"
3,7,261,Cab driver:,"Don't you know? Baby, this whole neighborhood is downwind of the sewage treatment plant.
"
3,7,262,Marshall:,"Wait... What did you just say?
"
3,7,263,Cab driver:,"I said, we're downwind of the sewage treatment plant.

"
3,13,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, sometimes in life you see someone and you just instantly know this is the person for you. It can happen anywhere. Even the waiting room of a tattoo removal clinic. And that's what happened when I met..Stella.
"
3,13,2,Stella:,"Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp. My bread and butter. So I'm guessing that the real story involves a bad breakup and some booze. Unless it's a gang tattoo, in which case, I think it's time to find a new gang.
"
3,13,3,Ted:,"No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden...
"
3,13,4,Stella:,"Well, I can get rid of it in ten one-hour sessions, but, I should warn you, laser surgery's very painful.
"
3,13,5,Ted:,"Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made.
"
3,13,6,Stella:,"Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?
"
3,13,7,Ted:,"No, the worst movie... Manos: Hands of Fate.
"
3,13,8,Stella:,"Uh, I'm a doctor, went to medical school. It's Plan 9. If you don't believe me, it's playing down at the Pamela Theater.
"
3,13,9,Ted:,"Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor.
"
3,13,10,Stella:,"Well, what are you doing tonight?
"
3,13,11,Stella:,"Hey, Ted.
"
3,13,12,Ted:,"Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me.
"
3,13,13,Stella:,"Oh, no, no, don't...
"
3,13,14,Ted:,"Come on, I insist.
"
3,13,15,Stella:,"That's so nice. Thank you. Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted. (3 women approaches) He wants to pay.
"
3,13,16,Ted:,"Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four.
"
3,13,17,"Woman 1, to Ted:","Is something wrong?
"
3,13,18,Ted:,"No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.
"
3,13,19,"Woman 2, to Woman 1:","What's wrong?
"
3,13,20,"Woman 1, to Woman 2:","Ted's embarrassed-- he thought this was a date.
"
3,13,21,"Woman 2, to Woman 3:","Ted thought this was a date.
"
3,13,22,"Woman 3, to Stella:","Stella, did you know Ted thought this was a date?
"
3,13,23,"Stella, to Woman 3:","What? I'm not allowed to date a patient. It's an AMA rule.
"
3,13,24,"Woman 3, to Woman 2:","She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule.
"
3,13,25,"Woman 2, to Woman 1:","She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule.
"
3,13,26,"Woman 1, to Ted:","She's not allowed to date...
"
3,13,27,Ted:,"Yeah, I got it.
"
3,13,28,Man:,"We all got it. Ted's a schmuck.
"
3,13,29,Stella:,"And you bought all the tickets.
"
3,13,30,Ted:,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie.
"
3,13,31,Stella:,"I am so sorry that you thought that was a date.
"
3,13,32,Ted:,"No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then.
"
3,13,33,Stella:,"Well, then,fair warning: I'm going to say no.
"
3,13,34,Ted:,"Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?
"
3,13,35,Stella:,"No.
"
3,13,36,Ted:,"Boyfriend?
"
3,13,37,Stella:,"No.
"
3,13,38,Ted:,"Lesbian?
"
3,13,39,Stella:,"No.
"
3,13,40,Ted:,"Only date black guys?
"
3,13,41,Stella:,"No.
"
3,13,42,Ted:,"And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be...
"
3,13,43,Stella:,"No.
"
3,13,44,Robin:,"No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic.
"
3,13,45,Ted:,"This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?
"
3,13,46,Marshall:,"Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.
"
3,13,47,Barney:,"Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind.
"
3,13,48,Ted:,"That's ridiculous.
"
3,13,49,Barney:,"Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.
"
3,13,50,Stella:,"Lower back butterfly tattoo... you're up.
"
3,13,51,Ted:,"So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.
"
3,13,52,Robin:,"Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?
"
3,13,53,Lily:,"I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails.
"
3,13,54,Marshall:,"But, baby, you love biting your nails.
"
3,13,55,Lily:,"I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard.
"
3,13,56,Ted:,"Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that ""no"" into a ""yes.""
"
3,13,57,Barney:,"Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?
"
3,13,58,Stella:,"This is going to hurt a little.
"
3,13,59,Ted:,"Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and... (He screams in a high-pitched ton)
"
3,13,60,Stella:,"Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts. Everyone probably sounds like that.
"
3,13,61,Abby:,"Doctor, are you all right? I heard a woman screaming in here. Oh. (she starts laughing and leave)
"
3,13,62,Ted:,"Here's to nine more great sessions.
"
3,13,63,Ted from 2030:,"Weeks went by. The second session I told her about how I spent a summer working with inner-city kids. The third session we both spoke nothing but French. The fourth session I made her laugh so hard she fell out of her chair. So by the time the fifth session came around...
"
3,13,64,Stella:,"Still no.
"
3,13,65,Ted:,"Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.
"
3,13,66,Barney:,"You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.
"
3,13,67,Ted:,"You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?
"
3,13,68,Barney:,"Magic's not lame.
"
3,13,69,Ted:,"I don't get it. I mean...
"
3,13,70,Barney:,"Is this lame?
"
3,13,71,Robin:,"Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table.
"
3,13,72,Marshall:,"What the hell is wrong with you?
"
3,13,73,Robin:,"There's alcohol in here.
"
3,13,74,Lily:,"Barney...
"
3,13,75,Barney:,"I...
"
3,13,76,Lily:,"We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.
"
3,13,77,Barney:,"Yeah, but Ted provoked me.
"
3,13,78,Lily:,"No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there.
"
3,13,79,Barney:,"But...
"
3,13,80,Lily:,"Go!
"
3,13,81,Ted:,"Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.
"
3,13,82,Lily:,"You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face.
"
3,13,83,Marshall:,"Works for baboons. It's called ""presenting.""
"
3,13,84,Ted:,"I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.
"
3,13,85,Barney:,"You can't turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"" Ted. Can't be done.
"
3,13,86,Robin:,"I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said ""yes"" eventually.
"
3,13,87,Barney:,"No, you didn't. You were like, ""No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group.""
"
3,13,88,Robin:,"To Ted.
"
3,13,89,Barney:,"Oh, right.
"
3,13,90,Ted:,"Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle.
"
3,13,91,Abby:,"Sir, please don't yell at me, because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying. Please don't do it.
"
3,13,92,Stella:,"Abby, I've told you before.
"
3,13,93,Abby:,"..Please...
"
3,13,94,Stella:,"When they're rude to you, hang up the phone.
"
3,13,95,Abby:,"..how difficult it is for me to...
"
3,13,96,Stella:,"Go on, you can do this, hang up. Abby, hang it up.
"
3,13,97,Abby:,"I am too busy to waste my time... (Abby finally hangs up)
"
3,13,98,Stella:,"I'm sorry, I just wish that some of the patients would be nicer to you.
"
3,13,99,Ted:,"The receptionist. That's my way in.
"
3,13,100,Barney:,"I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan.
"
3,13,101,Ted:,"That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?
"
3,13,102,Barney:,"Who?
"
3,13,103,Ted:,"Here's the plan.
"
3,13,104,Ted:,"Hi. Here. I stopped... (He takes the bag back and wait for stella to be able to see him to give it back to Abby) Hi, I stopped for coffee and I... and I thought I'd grab you something.
"
3,13,105,Abby:,"Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice. You're like a knight. I should call you Sir Ted.
"
3,13,106,Ted:,"What?
"
3,13,107,Abby:,"Nothing. Nothing. (laughs nervously) It's really stupid. (She calls Stella, who is standing right behind her) Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.
"
3,13,108,Stella:,"Thanks. Thanks, Abby.
"
3,13,109,Ted:,"And now... we wait.
"
3,13,110,Ted from 2030:,"And sure enough, by session seven, she saw me in a whole new light.
"
3,13,111,Stella:,"Okay, I'm about to break my big rule here.
"
3,13,112,Ted:,"Break it.
"
3,13,113,Stella:,"Okay. Abby goes bowling with her church group every Wednesday nights...and she really wanted to invite you, but she's too shy.
"
3,13,114,Ted:,"Abby is...?
"
3,13,115,Stella:,"My receptionist. You really made quite an impression on her with the coffee the other day. I mean, she has really not stopped talking about you.
"
3,13,116,Ted:,"Oh, Abby. I thought you said ""Alan.""
"
3,13,117,Stella:,"But you just said, ""Abby is...?""
"
3,13,118,Ted:,"Right. Right, I thought I said ""Alan.""
"
3,13,119,Stella:,"Who's Alan?
"
3,13,120,Ted:,"Who's Abby?
"
3,13,121,Stella:,"My receptionist.
"
3,13,122,Ted:,"Exactly.
"
3,13,123,Ted:,"What is happening?
"
3,13,124,Lily:,"Ted. You just got to be yourself, no more gimmicks.
"
3,13,125,Ted:,"You're right, no more gimmicks. One more gimmick.
"
3,13,126,Ted:,"You know what's on her shelf? That self-help book 'The Power of Me'.
"
3,13,127,Ted:,"I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about.
"
3,13,128,Marshall:,"It's actually a great book. It taught me the power of complete memory.
"
3,13,129,Ted:,"Can I borrow your copy?
"
3,13,130,Marshall:,"I left it somewhere... I forget.
"
3,13,131,Ted:,"Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.
"
3,13,132,Abby:,"Hi, Ted. I'll let her know.
"
3,13,133,Ted:,"Telepathically?
"
3,13,134,"Abby, laughing:","That's funny. That's funny, smart, and great.
"
3,13,135,Stella:,"I am so sorry that I am late. I have, like, two minutes for lunch everyday.
"
3,13,136,Ted:,"It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny...
"
3,13,137,Stella:,"What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, I would never read that piece of crap. Some patient left it here.
"
3,13,138,Ted:,"Oh, thank God. (chuckling) I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, ""Get a life, people!""
"
3,13,139,Abby:,"Ted, I found your book.
"
3,13,140,Ted:,"What?
"
3,13,141,Abby:,"Your book 'The Power of Me'. I think you accidentally dropped it in the garbage.
"
3,13,142,Ted:,"What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life.
"
3,13,143,Abby:,"No, you were reading it in the lobby.
"
3,13,144,Ted:,"Wha... no, you have me confused with someone else.
"
3,13,145,Abby:,"No, no, look right here. ""From the personal library of Ted Mosby."" That's you.
"
3,13,146,Robin:,"Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's ""nail the receptionist"" time.
"
3,13,147,Ted:,"I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.
"
3,13,148,Barney:,"Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.
"
3,13,149,Ted:,"No. I like Stella.
"
3,13,150,Barney:,"Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.
"
3,13,151,Ted:,"What do you mean?
"
3,13,152,Barney:,"I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.
"
3,13,153,Ted:,"What? What is it?
"
3,13,154,Barney:,"Hold on, I gotta pee. (He stands up et goes to the toilets) Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work?
"
3,13,155,Ted:,"What's the big secret?!
"
3,13,156,Barney:,"Oh. Oh, right.
"
3,13,157,Barney:,"Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.
"
3,13,158,Abby:,"Sure, what's it regarding?
"
3,13,159,Barney:,"Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like.
"
3,13,160,Abby:,"I-I don't understand.
"
3,13,161,Barney:,"I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!
"
3,13,162,Abby:,"Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying.
"
3,13,163,Barney:,"What are your credentials?!
"
3,13,164,Abby:,"Please don't do that. Please.
"
3,13,165,Barney:,"I want to know who am I speaking with!
"
3,13,166,Barney:,"At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation.
"
3,13,167,Stella:,"Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?
"
3,13,168,Abby:,"No.
"
3,13,169,Stella:,"When am I going to kick this folliculaphilia?
"
3,13,170,Ted:,"Folliculaphilia?
"
3,13,171,Barney:,"Folliculaphilia.
"
3,13,172,Ted:,"What is that?
"
3,13,173,Barney:,"Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.
"
3,13,174,Ted:,"That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.
"
3,13,175,Barney:,"You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.
"
3,13,176,Ted:,"I know that you are because there's no such thing.
"
3,13,177,Robin:,"I got it a little bit.
"
3,13,178,Ted:,"Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.
"
3,13,179,Abby:,"Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache. You look like a young Tom Selleck, only a million times handsomer. Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you. Just kidding. Stupid.
"
3,13,180,Stella:,"Sorry I'm late. Typical two-minute lunch. So we are very close to getting...
"
3,13,181,Ted:,"Why? Just why?
"
3,13,182,Barney:,"Y-you don't remember?
"
3,13,183,Barney:,"I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache.
"
3,13,184,Ted:,"Uh... okay.
"
3,13,185,Ted:,"You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?
"
3,13,186,Barney:,"I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.
"
3,13,187,Ted:,"This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her.
"
3,13,188,Lily:,"No, you have to. She likes you. She said so herself. (clearing throat) I mean...
"
3,13,189,Ted:,"Oh, my God, you went and saw her, too.
"
3,13,190,Lily:,"I swear to you, I did not.
"
3,13,191,Marshall:,"My wife's always getting on me about my dry elbows. So good to be in a relationship. Anyone special in your life? Or maybe just someone you're interested in? Interes-ted in?
"
3,13,192,Stella:,"You know, we should really get this mole checked out. It's just a little irregular.
"
3,13,193,Marshall:,"Irregular? Oh, my God. This is it. It's all over.
"
3,13,194,Stella:,"One of my patients has this little butterfly tattoo at the bottom of his back.
"
3,13,195,Marshall:,"Can you stop talking about your other patients?! I'm dying here, woman!
"
3,13,196,Stella:,"There you go. Look, even if it is something, it's easily treatable, so try to relax.
"
3,13,197,Marshall:,"Okay. Hey, what was it you were saying before about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?
"
3,13,198,Stella:,"Oh, that... that's nothing. It's just a little crush. So I will be calling you with your results.
"
3,13,199,Marshall:,"Oh. Okay. Thank you.
"
3,13,200,Stella:,"Oh, sir, your book!
"
3,13,201,Ted:,"No.
"
3,13,202,Marshall:,"Yes.
"
3,13,203,Ted:,"She said ""crush""? And she was talking about me?
"
3,13,204,Ted from 2030:,"That last session was the least painful of all. I savored every searing blast of that laser.
"
3,13,205,Stella:,"All done.
"
3,13,206,Ted from 2030:,"The moment I'd waited ten weeks for had arrived.
"
3,13,207,Ted:,"Stella...now that I'm no longer your patient, would you like to have dinner with me?
"
3,13,208,Stella:,"Ted, you're a really nice guy...
"
3,13,209,Ted:,"Oh, no.
"
3,13,210,Stella:,"It has been so great getting to know you.
"
3,13,211,Ted:,"I am gonna kill Marshall.
"
3,13,212,Stella:,"I've had so much fun these last ten weeks.
"
3,13,213,Ted:,"Oh, my God, this is worse than the laser.
"
3,13,214,Stella:,"I have a daughter.
"
3,13,215,Ted:,"What?

3,13,216,Stella:,"Her name's Lucy. She's eight. Work and being with her, that's pretty much my life. My social calendar is movie night with the girls once a month when I can get a sitter. I mean, I've been to one party in the past year... St. Paddy's Day... it was awful, I left early. But, really, my only free time is the two minutes I get for lunch, so... this is why I don't date. Ted, I only have time for one most important person in my life, and that's Lucy. Anyway, it's been fun. Next time, think before you ink. But if you ever do wake up with, like, a dolphin tattoo on your ankle, just give me a call.
"
3,13,217,Ted:,"There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.
"
3,13,218,Marshall:,"Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp.
"
3,13,219,Ted:,"I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.
"
3,13,220,Ted:,"You didn't actually say no.
"
3,13,221,Stella:,"What do you mean?
"
3,13,222,Ted:,"All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?
"
3,13,223,Stella:,"Right.
"
3,13,224,Ted:,"Okay. You want to, uh... go on a a two-minute date with me?
"
3,13,225,Stella:,"Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter. Um... Okay.

"
3,13,232,Stella:,"380 West 22nd? That's...

"
3,13,245,Waitress:,"Of course.
"
3,13,246,Ted:,"Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous?
"
3,13,247,Stella:,"A little bit.
"
3,13,248,Ted:,"You can't tell at all.

3,13,259,Ted:,"How we doing on time? Taxi!
"
3,13,260,Stella:,"We got a little time.
"
3,13,261,Ted:,"Okay. Do you want to walk it?
"
3,13,262,Stella:,"Why not?
"
3,13,263,Ranjit:,"Hello! Good-bye!
"
3,13,264,Ted:,"So what grade's your daughter in?
"
3,13,265,Stella:,"Third grade.
"
3,13,266,Ted:,"Ah! That's a good year.
"
3,13,267,Stella:,"Yeah, she's wonderful. I just wish that I could get her to quit smoking, you know?
"
3,13,268,Ted:,"What?
"
3,13,269,Stella:,"I'm kidding.
"
3,13,270,Ted:,"Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?
"
3,13,271,Stella:,"You know, this neighborhood just keeps on changing. This used to be a cute, little Italian restaurant.
"
3,13,272,Ted:,"I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go.
"
3,13,273,Stella:,"Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.
"
3,13,274,Ted:,"Flowers?
"
3,13,275,Stella:,"I'm allergic.
"
3,13,276,Ted:,"Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time.
"
3,13,277,Stella:,"Me, too, Ted.
"
3,13,278,Ted:,"And... date.
"
3,13,279,Stella:,"Huh?
"
3,13,280,Ted:,"That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss.
"
3,13,281,Stella:,"I think I can be late just once. (They kiss) Ted...
"
3,13,282,Ted:,"Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call?
"
3,13,283,Stella:,"Yes.
"
3,13,284,Ted:,"Okay.
"
3,13,285,Ted from 2030:,"And that, kids, is how you turn a ""no"" into a ""yes.""
"
3,13,286,Abby:,"All my friends told me, ""Abby, be strong. He doesn't deserve another chance."" But I forgive you! (She runs after Ted)
"
3,13,287,Ted:,"No, no, no, no!
"
3,13,288,Abby:,"..then he just kept toying with my emotions.
"
3,13,289,Barney:,"Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.
"
3,13,290,Abby:,"Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?
"
3,13,291,Barney:,"Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?
"
3,13,292,Abby:,"My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.
"
3,13,293,Barney:,"We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.
"
3,13,294,Abby:,"Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have s*x on it and then go shopping.
"
3,13,295,Barney:,"I like you.
"
3,12,1,"In fairness, I did call Ted's butt at, like, 2:","0 this afternoon.

3,6,4,Barney:,"This is incredible!
"
3,6,5,Marshall:,"(At the same time) Oh my God! I can't believe it!
"
3,6,6,Barney:,"I have big news!
"
3,6,7,Marshall:,"(At the same time) Oh my God!
"
3,6,8,Barney:,"Okay. My thing's pretty huge. But fine, you can go first.
"
3,6,9,Marshall:,"Okay, I just found out...
"
3,6,10,Barney:,"I just find a porno starring Ted Mosby!
"
3,6,11,Ted:,"What are you... What you're talking about?
"
3,6,12,Barney:,"I'm talking about welcome to the s*x plane, and look who plays the navigator, Ted Mosby (He shows a porno dvd)
"
3,6,13,Ted:,"Oh, it's the same exact spelling as my name.
"
3,6,14,Marshall:,"Okay, you know, cute coincidence, Barney. Whatever. I just got on the phone with the NR...
"
3,6,15,Ted:,"Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day.
"
3,6,16,[Flashback - At the doctor's - Ted/Ted doctor's]The doctor:,"Open wide. I guess you're more used to saying that hearing it, huh, Ted Mosby?
"
3,6,17,[End Flashback]Ted:,"Who is this guy? And why my doctor watching p0rn?
"
3,6,18,Barney:,"All right. Let's meet your new doppelganger. Or should I say doppel banger.
"
3,6,19,Marshall:,"Guys, guys, guys! Can I tell my news? It's pretty...
"
3,6,20,Ted:,"This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil war.
"
3,6,21,Barney:,"Probably not the same guy.
"
3,6,22,Marshall (yelling):,"I got the job at the NRDC.

"
3,6,27,Ted:,"Yeah, it really is.
"
3,6,28,Barney:,"Oh, hey, hey-o. New guy entering the cockpit. Could it be the navigator, Ted Mosby.
"
3,6,29,Ted:,"Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain.
"
3,6,30,Barney:,"Yeah, and I'm sure complete accuracy in all those details was very important to the directors... ""Dirt and skank, the raunch brothers"".
"
3,6,31,Marshall:,"Baby, I have some exciting news.
"
3,6,32,Lily:,"I hope it's not that you just won some sort of race here.
"
3,6,33,Marshall:,"I got the job at the NRDC.
"
3,6,34,Lily:,"Wow.
"
3,6,35,Barney:,"And I found a porno starring Ted Mosby.

"
3,6,44,Robin:,"Oh, no! No, I meant, that Ted Mosby, he really knows what he's doing. Like all Ted Mosbys. (to Marshall) Wow, NRDC! Way to go, Marshall.
"
3,6,45,Lily:,"But you're still gonna go to your job interview today, right, baby?
"
3,6,46,Narrator:,"Marshall had an interview (Picture of a building) at a firm called Nicholson, Hewitt and West. (Video of a factory unit) They represented, well, pretty much everybody Marshall was going to sue (Video of a tree in the process of uproot) once he started at the NRDC.
"
3,6,47,Marshall:,"I'm not doing that interview. Those people are evil.
"
3,6,48,Lily:,"Marshall, your dad went through a lot of trouble to set this up. You can't just pull out at the last second.
"
3,6,49,Robin:,"Apparently you can.
"
3,6,50,Barney:,"Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat! Three stripes, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ted Mosby, p0rn star.
"
3,6,51,Robin:,"I know what kind of plane this is. It's a ""boing"".
"
3,6,52,Barney:,"See, this is way better than Marshall's intership.
"
3,6,53,Marshall:,"It's a real job.
"
3,6,54,Ted:,"Who is this guy? Are we related? Do, do I look like him?
"
3,6,55,Marshall:,"Hmm. It's hard to tell. Go, go like this.
"
3,6,56,All:,"Oh yeah. A little bit. Yeah.
"
3,6,57,Barney:,"More around the eyes.
"
3,6,58,Robin:,"Oh, I do see that.
"
3,6,59,Wendy:,"And here's you water, in case you're dehydrated, Ted Mosby.
"
3,6,60,Ted:,"Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p0rn. (She leaves) This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous.
"
3,6,61,Barney:,"Hmm. You're not wrong. (He looks on his phone) According to the web site, of the far superior Ted Mosby... he's been in the business three months, and he's made 125 movies.
"
3,6,62,Robin:,"Wow. That's 42 movies a month. Who is he, Jude Law? Right? He makes a lot of movies. I mean, not so much lately, but maybe, like, two years ago, you couldn't go to a movie without...
"
3,6,63,Ted:,"Shh.
"
3,6,64,Ted:,"Adult Video Weekly? Oh, no...
"
3,6,65,Ted:,"Hello?
"
3,6,66,Leonard:,"Hi, I'm looking for Ted Mosby. It's Leonard Ross from AVW.
"
3,6,67,Ted:,"Oh my God! (To Marshall and Lily) AVW? It's architecture vision weekly.
"
3,6,68,Leonard:,"Well, that's a bummer. Anyway, I'm calling to interview you about your latest project.
"
3,6,69,Ted:,"Well, I don't want to say it's my project. I mean, I'll be working with at least three partners.
"
3,6,70,Leonard:,"Oh! Group scene. Always fun.
"
3,6,71,Ted:,"Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I know they're gonna ride me pretty hard but they're great guys.
"
3,6,72,Leonard:,"Guys? Oh, wouah, there's a scoop.
"
3,6,73,Ted:,"That interview went on for 20 more minutes.
"
3,6,74,Lily:,"""This project was so demanding, I can't tell you how many nights I spent bent over a table.""
"
3,6,75,Lily:,"Oh, hey, baby, how'd the interview go?
"
3,6,76,Marshall:,"Um, interesting. There I am in the office of Jefferson Coatsworth and I figure I'm not gonna take this job anyway, I might as well give this old b*st*rd a piece of mind. Jefferson Coastworth wasn't what I expected.
"
3,6,77,Jefferson:,"Marshall, Jefferson Coastworth.
"
3,6,78,Marshall:,"Hello.
"
3,6,79,Jefferson:,"Dude, I am so, so psyched that you're here. Can I beer ya?

3,6,82,Jefferson:,"Go to hell! I'd do it again! (To the media) I'm innocent. I'm innoncent.

3,6,83,Jefferson:,"Marshall, why don't you want to work at Nicholson, Hewitt and West?
"
3,6,84,Marshall:,"Right, um, okay, Jeff, I've actually given this a lot of thought...
"
3,6,85,Jeff:,"I'm sorry. Stop. I can't do this with a straight face. You don't want to work here. You're only here 'cause your dad went to high school with Joe Hewitt. Fact is, you just got a sweet job at the NRDC. And it's awesome. Man, I could have gone the non-profit route. I didn't. And it eats me up inside every day. I hate myself. I hate myself.
"
3,6,86,Barney:,"Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique.
"
3,6,87,Marshall:,"What do you mean?
"
3,6,88,Barney:,"Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting ""oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y""! And by you, I mean her.
"
3,6,89,Marshall:,"He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.
"
3,6,90,Barney:,"That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?
"
3,6,91,Jeff:,"Let me buy you a dinner. Tomorrow night. As a thank you, okay? You'll tell me all about the NRDC, and we'll charge it all to one of my evil clients.
"
3,6,92,Marshall:,"I, you know, I don't know if...
"
3,6,93,Jeff:,"Marshall, you know what kobe beef is?
"
3,6,94,Marshall:,"The most expensive beef in the world.
"
3,6,95,Jeff:,"The place I'm taking you has kobe lobster. That is lobster fed with kobe beef.
"
3,6,96,Marshall:,"Oh my God. He's trying to seduce me.
"
3,6,97,Robin:,"So are you gonna go to dinner with him?
"
3,6,98,Marshall:,"No. No way. I promise myself to the NRDC. I'm not that kind of lawyer.
"
3,6,99,Lily:,"Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.
"
3,6,100,Barney:,"Don't wait up.
"
3,6,101,Robin:,"Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Ted Mosby p0rn star's bio says his hometown is your hometown. Shaker Heights, Ohio.
"
3,6,102,Ted:,"What? Okay, this is getting creepy. Who, who is this guy? I gotta find him.
"
3,6,103,Robin:,"Well, it's your lucky day. He's gonna be signing autographs tomorrow night in Manhattan at something called the Adult Video Expo.
"
3,6,104,Lily:,"Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p0rn?
"
3,6,105,Barney:,"Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America.
"
3,6,106,Marshall:,"You can really taste the beef in that lobster.
"
3,6,107,Jeff:,"Right, listen, I know we're only here to screw over my client, who quite frankly deserves it... hum, but I gotta be able to tell the guys upstairs I gave you the spiel, okay? So, first up, starting salary. (He gives him a paper).
"
3,6,108,Marshall:,"Okay. Here we go. This is the big number that's supposed to impress me and... (He looks at the paper) whoa, that's a BIG number.
"
3,6,109,Jeff:,"here's also a signing bonus, uh, use of a company car, expense account, blah, blah, blah. Hey, by the way, turn around and wave to Patrick Swayze.
"
3,6,110,Marshall:,"Hey, I'm going to, uh, try to remain cool. But you know Patrick Swayze?!
"
3,6,111,Jeff:,"He's a client. Who do you think bought us this wine? (To Patrick) Crazy, Swayze. Cheers, buddy.
"
3,6,112,Marshall:,"Okay, no. Jeff, this is all very impressive, but I just don't think that...
"
3,6,113,Jeff:,"Listen, I know, I know. You are not gonna be tempted by big numbers and fancy perks. You're gonna do the noble thing, take the low-paying job at the NRDC, live off you family money.
"
3,6,114,Marshall:,"Family money?
"
3,6,115,Jeff:,"You do have family money, don't you?
"
3,6,116,Marshall:,"No, hum, not that I know of. I do have an uncle who owns a, a pretty successful bait shop.
"
3,6,117,Jeff:,"NRDC. No family money. Hum. So you don't plane on having kids?
"
3,6,118,Marshall:,"Actually, I want to have four kids.
"
3,6,119,Jeff:,"Well. New York public school make a lot of parents nervous, but the kids who walk out, walk out proud.
"
3,6,120,Narrator:,"He was surely doing a tough decision. Now, kids, when I'm faced with a tough decision, I like to make a list of pros and cons. Marshall knew all cons. (We see the list. Pros: Money, Security, Swayze. Cons: Evil.) But there is one thing he didn't know, a big guy live in a pros con.

3,6,121,Robin:,"Lily, you're a kindergarten teacher?

"
3,6,128,Lily:,"I shop the sales. There were in the closet when we moved in. I steal. I'm a criminal. I once shot a man just to watch him die.

"
3,4,5,Ted:,"What's his 'but'?
"
3,4,6,Lily:,"What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.

3,4,15,Robin:,"Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.
"
3,4,16,Barney:,"If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!
"
3,4,17,Lily:,"Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.

3,4,20,Ted:,"Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.
"
3,4,21,Lily:,"But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.
"
3,4,22,Ted:,"Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.
"
3,4,23,Robin:,"I don't hate kids.
"
3,4,24,Ted:,"You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.
"
3,4,25,Little Girl:,"Robin, will you watch cartoons with me?
"
3,4,26,Little Robin:,"I go to school all week. Can't I just have five minutes to myself to read Highlights and drink my juice?
"
3,4,27,Robin:,"OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them.
"
3,4,28,Ted:,"Well, you don't wanna have them.
"
3,4,29,Robin:,"I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my v*g1n*
"
3,4,30,Barney:,"Shotgun.
"
3,4,31,Marshall:,"You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.
"
3,4,32,Barney:,"Nice.
"
3,4,33,Robin:,"You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy.
"
3,4,34,Lily:,"OK, that's awesome.
"
3,4,35,Robin:,"Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but...
"
3,4,36,Ted:,"(to himself) But she's afraid of commitment.
"
3,4,37,Lily:,"(to herself) But she's a gun nut.
"
3,4,38,Barney:,"(to himself) But she's Canadian.
"
3,4,39,Marshall:,"(to himself) But she didn't like Field of Dreams.
"
3,4,40,Barney:,"I can't think of anything.
"
3,4,41,Ted:,"You don't have a 'but'.
"
3,4,42,Barney:,"OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.
"
3,4,43,Ted:,"Why?
"
3,4,44,Barney:,"The ultimate ice breaker.
"
3,4,45,Barney:,"A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.
"
3,4,46,Ted:,"So, what are the eye patches for?
"
3,4,47,Barney:,"We got bit.
"
3,4,48,Ted:,"On the eye? Barney: Yes.
"
3,4,49,Ted:,"Both of us.
"
3,4,50,Barney:,"They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!
"
3,4,51,Future Ted VO:,"So, Robin went on a date with George, the guy with the kid. And afterwards...
"
3,4,52,Robin:,"OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date.
"
3,4,53,Lily:,"But?
"
3,4,54,(flashback to Robin and George walking on street having ice cream on their date) Robin:,"Great, I can't wait to meet him.
"
3,4,55,Robin:,"Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid.
"
3,4,56,Lily:,"Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later.
"
3,4,57,Robin:,"I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.
"
3,4,58,Lily:,"Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting.
"
3,4,59,Robin:,"Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?
"
3,4,60,Lily:,"A good one. He won full custody.
"
3,4,61,Robin:,"He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?
"
3,4,62,Robin:,"Don't tell anyone I said that.
"
3,4,63,(Barney and Ted sit at booth) Barney:,"I'm going out, buying eye patches. What are you doing to help score chicks?
"
3,4,64,Ted:,"OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.
"
3,4,65,Barney:,"Oh, Theodore...
"
3,4,66,Barney:,"..no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.
"
3,4,67,Ted:,"Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.
"
3,4,68,Barney:,"Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.
"
3,4,69,Ted:,"Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.
"
3,4,70,Barney:,"Wow.
"
3,4,71,Marshall:,"Wow. You're here and not in stall two.
"
3,4,72,Ted:,"Yeah, so?
"
3,4,73,Marshall:,"I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.
"
3,4,74,Barney:,"OK, Marshall.
"
3,4,75,Marshall:,"Yes.
"
3,4,76,Barney:,"Which one of us has more game?
"
3,4,77,Marshall:,"Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.
"
3,4,78,Barney:,"What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game.
"
3,4,79,Ted:,"Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.
"
3,4,80,Marshall:,"You're joking. I have mad game, bra.
"
3,4,81,Barney:,"OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.
"
3,4,82,Ted:,"I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.
"
3,4,83,Marshall:,"What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.
"
3,4,84,Barney:,"Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.
"
3,4,85,Marshall:,"Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?
"
3,4,86,Ted:,"First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.
"
3,4,87,Marshall:,"Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.
"
3,4,88,Barney:,"Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.
"
3,4,89,Ted:,"Fine.
"
3,4,90,Barney:,"There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...
"
3,4,91,Ted:,"Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.
"
3,4,92,Barney:,"That's good too.
"
3,4,93,Barney:,"How about her?
"
3,4,94,Ted:,"You're on.
"
3,4,95,Barney:,"Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?
"
3,4,96,Ted:,"OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.
"
3,4,97,Marshall:,"One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.
"
3,4,98,Ted:,"Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.
"
3,4,99,Ted:,"Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.
"
3,4,100,Barney:,"I win.
"
3,4,101,Ted:,"How?
"
3,4,102,Barney:,"Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.
"
3,4,103,Ted:,"Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.
"
3,4,104,Barney:,"I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.
"
3,4,105,Ted:,"Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.
"
3,4,106,Marshall:,"Ted, she's leaving.
"
3,4,107,Ted:,"Get out of my way.
"
3,4,108,Barney:,"By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.
"
3,4,109,Marshall:,"Look who's got game.
"
3,4,110,George:,"You're a big kids person, huh?
"
3,4,111,Robin:,"Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.
"
3,4,112,George:,"Babies.
"
3,4,113,Robin:,"Yeah, I like that kind.
"
3,4,114,George:,"Well, Doug's almost six
"
3,4,115,Robin:,"Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to... (Robin nods) I hate kids.
"
3,4,116,George:,"Excuse me, what? Robin: I mean, I don't hate kids. I'm just not a kid person. I mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little, but beyond that, what's the draw? You must think I'm nuts.
"
3,4,117,George:,"What? No no no. So you don't like kids, so what? I'm not looking for a mother for Doug. Why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?
"
3,4,118,Robin:,"Yeah, let's take things slow.
"
3,4,119,Future Ted VO:,"And, kids, that's exactly what she did.
"
3,4,120,Future Ted VO:,"Then on a totally different day that was definitely not the next morning, Aunt Robin had to face her worst fear.
"
3,4,121,Lily:,"Hey, what's up?
"
3,4,122,Robin:,"It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?
"
3,4,123,Lily:,"Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.
"
3,4,124,Doug:,"Who are you? Robin: I'm Robin.
"
3,4,125,Doug:,"That's a bird's name.
"
3,4,126,Robin:,"No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.
"
3,4,127,Doug:,"My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code?
"
3,4,128,Robin:,"Dude, I'm just reading my paper.
"
3,4,129,Doug:,"Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal?
"
3,4,130,Robin:,"Sure.
"
3,4,131,Doug:,"What are you doing? You're supposed to pour milk first? Robin: What? No, you pour the cereal first so you know how much milk you need.
"
3,4,132,Doug:,"It tastes better milk first.
"
3,4,133,Robin:,"It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.
"
3,4,134,Doug:,"Why are you wearing my dad's pants?
"
3,4,135,Robin:,"Milk first it is.
"
3,4,136,Doug:,"What are you reading? Robin: The business section. The Fed's gonna lower rates again to bail out these subprime lenders, bunch of idiots.
"
3,4,137,Doug:,"Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.
"
3,4,138,Robin:,"Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.
"
3,4,139,Doug:,"That's what I said. You're pretty cool.
"
3,4,140,Robin:,"You too.
"
3,4,141,Future Ted VO:,"Meanwhile, Stacy and I had started dating. Oh, Stacy was the girl from the bar. Anyway, I was close to winning the bet when something unexpected happened, I started to really like her.
"
3,4,142,Ted:,"Well, have fun in yoga.
"
3,4,143,Ted:,"She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.
"
3,4,144,Ted:,"Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.
"
3,4,145,Ted:,"You see this. Game face.
"
3,4,146,Barney:,"Whatever, Ted.
"
3,4,147,Ted:,"Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?
"
3,4,148,Barney:,"Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.
"
3,4,149,Marshall:,"I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it...
"
3,4,150,Barney:,"Nice.
"
3,4,151,Marshall:,"One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had s*x and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.
"
3,4,152,Barney:,"Doesn't count.
"
3,4,153,Marshall:,"Totally counts.
"
3,4,154,Ted:,"You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had s*x once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.
"
3,4,155,Barney:,"OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.
"
3,4,156,Ted:,"Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.
"
3,4,157,Barney:,"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.
"
3,4,158,Barney:,"No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going (lowers head slightly and shakes it vigorously) on what I've already gone (lowers head again slightly and shakes it vigorously) on.
"
3,4,159,Ted:,"Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?
"
3,4,160,Barney:,"Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.
"
3,4,161,Ted:,"Fine.
"
3,4,162,Barney:,"And I only stirred that with my pinky.
"
3,4,163,Robin:,"Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.
"
3,4,164,Lily:,"Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me.
"
3,4,165,Robin:,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him.
"
3,4,166,Lily:,"What?
"
3,4,167,Robin:,"Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.
"
3,4,168,Robin:,"What?
"
3,4,169,Lily:,"I hate to tell you this but, too late.
"
3,4,170,Lily:,"He drew it in class today.
"
3,4,171,Robin:,"Oh crap.
"
3,4,172,Robin:,"There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.
"
3,4,173,Lily:,"You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.
"
3,4,174,Robin:,"We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me
"
3,4,175,Marshall:,"That's totally you.
"
3,4,176,Robin:,"You guys are totally crazy.
"
3,4,177,Ted:,"Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?
"
3,4,178,Robin:,"It's not me.
"
3,4,179,Marshall:,"You're joking, right?
"
3,4,180,Robin:,"It's not me.
"
3,4,181,Ted:,"""My new mommy."" Kinda has a nice ring to it.
"
3,4,182,Marshall:,"Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?
"
3,4,183,Robin:,"Do guys really think this is me?
"
3,4,184,Lily:,"Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.
"
3,4,185,Robin:,"Really?
"
3,4,186,Lily:,"Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.
"
3,4,187,Robin:,"Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass.
"
3,4,188,Stacy:,"So, I, I had a really nice time tonight.
"
3,4,189,Ted:,"Me too.
"
3,4,190,Stacy:,"Yeah?
"
3,4,191,Ted:,"Mm-hm.
"
3,4,192,Little Barney:,"Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want but I was here first.
"
3,4,193,Little Barney:,"From this spot, I also launched an expedition to those two large ridges down there.
"
3,4,194,Stacy:,"Uh, Ted, something wrong?
"
3,4,195,Robin:,"Hey, Doug.
"
3,4,196,Doug:,"Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower.
"
3,4,197,Robin:,"Actually, I came to see you.
"
3,4,198,Doug:,"I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.?
"
3,4,199,Robin:,"Sure, why not?
"
3,4,200,Doug:,"To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies.
"
3,4,201,Robin:,"Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.
"
3,4,202,Robin:,"Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.
"
3,4,203,Future Ted VO:,"Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before.
"
3,4,204,Robin:,"We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.
"
3,4,205,Brooke:,"Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter.
"
3,4,206,Brooke:,"I had so much coffee earlier, I need to run to the loo. Hey Dougie.
"
3,4,207,Robin:,"What the hell was that? Doug: That was my new mommy.
"
3,4,208,Robin:,"So, this picture is not of me?
"
3,4,209,Doug:,"Why would I draw a picture of you?
"
3,4,210,Robin:,"How many dates has she been on with your dad?
"
3,4,211,Doug:,"Two.
"
3,4,212,Robin:,"Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?
"
3,4,213,Doug:,"We just really connected.
"
3,4,214,Robin:,"And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.
"
3,4,215,Doug:,"Why are you getting so upset, Roberta?
"
3,4,216,Robin:,"Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember?
"
3,4,217,Doug:,"Whatever.
"
3,4,218,Robin:,"So, that's it, huh?
"
3,4,219,Doug:,"Look, you're great, but...
"
3,4,220,Robin:,"Yeah, there's always a 'but'.
"
3,4,221,Ted:,"Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.
"
3,4,222,Marshall:,"Which Chumbawumba song? Barney: Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win.
"
3,4,223,Ted:,"What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.
"
3,4,224,Barney:,"That's what you think happened.
"
3,4,225,Ted:,"OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...
"
3,4,226,Barney:,"Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?
"
3,4,227,Stacy:,"You are so sweet.
"
3,4,228,Barney:,"So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.
"
3,4,229,Ted:,"So you never slept with her?
"
3,4,230,Barney:,"Not even at all.
"
3,4,231,Marshall:,"Wow, that's good.
"
3,4,232,Barney:,"It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?
"
3,4,233,Ted:,"Well., have fun in yoga
"
3,4,234,Barney:,"Well?
"
3,4,235,Barney:,"Oh.
"
3,4,236,Stacy:,"I'm sorry.
"
3,4,237,Barney:,"Stacy, right?
"
3,4,238,Stacy:,"Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?
"
3,4,239,Barney:,"Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?
"
3,4,240,Stacy:,"I do.
"
3,4,241,(flashback to Ted telling Barney about Stacy) Ted:,"She plays bass in a reggae band.
"
3,4,242,Barney:,"I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.
"
3,4,243,Stacy:,"Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band.
"
3,4,244,Barney:,"No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.
"
3,4,245,Ted:,"After a while crocodile.
"
3,4,246,"Stacy, Barney:","See you later alligator.
"
3,4,247,Barney:,"We are two peas.
"
3,4,248,Barney:,"Wow, take care. Namaste.
"
3,4,249,Ted:,"You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.
"
3,4,250,Barney:,"So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.
"
3,4,251,Barney:,"Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches.
"
3,4,252,Ted:,"No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...
"
3,4,253,Barney:,"Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.
"
3,4,254,Barney:,"Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.
"
3,4,255,Ted:,"I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.
"
3,4,256,Lily:,"I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.
"
3,4,257,Robin:,"Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids.
"
3,4,258,Future Ted VO:,"Of course, Robin eventually made her peace with kids. And as you guys know she went on to appear in some very important works of arts. Yours.
"
3,4,259,Stacy:,"Hey.
"
3,4,260,Stacy:,"You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow.
"
3,4,261,Barney:,"That's what makes you so special, baby.
"
3,4,262,Stacy:,"Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy.
"
3,5,1,Future Ted VO:,"Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her...
"
3,5,2,Ted:,"Everyone, this is Blah-blah.
"
3,5,3,Blah-blah:,"Please call me Blah.
"
3,5,4,Marshall:,"So, Blah, how did you two meet?
"
3,5,5,Blah-blah:,"Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.
"
3,5,6,Ted:,"It was so magical.
"
3,5,7,Future Ted VO:,"Except it wasn't.
"
3,5,8,Ted:,"She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.
"
3,5,9,Marshall:,"Ay, Chihuahua.
"
3,5,10,Ted:,"What? There's no stigma anymore.
"
3,5,11,Robin:,"Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.
"
3,5,12,Barney:,"So, she's hot.
"
3,5,13,Ted:,"Oh, she's gorgeous.
"
3,5,14,Barney:,"Then she's crazy.
"
3,5,15,Ted:,"No she's not.
"
3,5,16,Barney:,"Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.
"
3,5,17,Ted:,"OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.
"
3,5,18,Barney:,"There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.
"
3,5,19,Ted:,"She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.
"
3,5,20,Robin:,"Wait, hot-crazy scale?
"
3,5,21,Barney:,"Let me illustrate.
"
3,5,22,Barney:,"A girl is allowed to be crazy...
"
3,5,23,Barney:,".. as long as she is equally hot.
"
3,5,24,Barney:,"Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.
"
3,5,25,Barney:,"If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.
"
3,5,26,Barney:,"You want the girl to be above this line
"
3,5,27,Barney:,"Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...
"
3,5,28,Barney:,"..then lose ten pounds.
"
3,5,29,Barney:,"She'd stab me with a fork...
"
3,5,30,Barney:,".. then get a boob job.
"
3,5,31,Barney:,"I should give her a call.
"
3,5,32,Ted:,"OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.
"
3,5,33,Barney:,"I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...
"
3,5,34,Ted:,"She's not crazy.
"
3,5,35,Barney:,"OK, we'll see.
"
3,5,36,Blah-blah:,"Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.
"
3,5,37,Barney:,"It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.
"
3,5,38,Ted:,"You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.
"
3,5,39,Blah-blah:,"Yeah. Marshall: All right, but spoiler alert, it ends with everyone saying 'aw.'
"
3,5,40,Lily:,"Aw.
"
3,5,41,Marshall:,"Starts with it too.
"
3,5,42,Future Ted VO:,"When you've been a couple as long as Marshall and Lily, telling the how we met story becomes a choreographed dance.
"
3,5,43,Lily:,"It was late August 1996
"
3,5,44,Marshall:,"Lily and I were both freshmen moving into
"
3,5,45,"Lily, Marshall:","Hewitt Hall.
"
3,5,46,Marshall VO:,"And she needed some help setting up her stereo.
"
3,5,47,Lily VO:,"For some unknown reason, I felt drawn to room 110.
"
3,5,48,Marshall VO:,"As if she knew that someone very special was behind that door.
"
3,5,49,Lily VO:,"And as fate would have it, that someone was Marshall.
"
3,5,50,"Marshall, Lily VO:","It was love at first sight.
"
3,5,51,College Marshall:,"Hi.
"
3,5,52,College Lily:,"Hi.
"
3,5,53,Blah-blah:,"Ohhh.
"
3,5,54,Marshall:,"I know, right?
"
3,5,55,Future Ted VO:,"Now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings. The first time Marshall told it to me, it was a little different.
"
3,5,56,Marshall:,"Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today, (singing) wanna tap that.
"
3,5,57,Blah-blah:,"You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did.
"
3,5,58,Blah-blah:,"Saw 'aw.'
"
3,5,59,Everyone:,"Aw.
"
3,5,60,Blah-blah:,"I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys.
"
3,5,61,Ted:,"Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.
"
3,5,62,(Barney is about to say something) Ted:,"Shut up.
"
3,5,63,(back from commercial break) Blah-blah:,"So, we know how Marshall and Lily met. Robin, how did you and Barney meet?
"
3,5,64,Robin:,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.
"
3,5,65,Barney:,"Really? Sixteen no's. Really?
"
3,5,66,Blah-blah:,"So, you're single.
"
3,5,67,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
3,5,68,Blah-blah:,"Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.
"
3,5,69,Ted:,"You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.
"
3,5,70,Future Ted VO:,"Kids, to understand this story, you need to know that your Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich.
"
3,5,71,College Guy:,"Dude, I heard the dean is coming. Put out your sandwich.
"
3,5,72,College Ted:,"Hey.
"
3,5,73,College Marshall:,"Good afternoon, sir. I'm Marshall Eriksen. College Ted: Sir? Please, just call me Ted.
"
3,5,74,College Marshall:,"OK, Dean Ted.
"
3,5,75,College Ted:,"Whoa. Someone's been eating a sandwich.
"
3,5,76,College Marshall:,"What? No. Really? I don't know 'cause I don't even know what sandwiches smell like. My parents are gonna donate a lot of money to this school.
"
3,5,77,College Ted:,"So you're bottom bunk, that's cool. I wanted the top bunk anyway.
"
3,5,78,College Marshall:,"What do you mean?
"
3,5,79,College Ted:,"I'm your new roommate. College Marshall: This is so unfair.
"
3,5,80,Marshall:,"I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.
"
3,5,81,Marshall:,"You're not the dean.
"
3,5,82,Robin:,"College, good times.
"
3,5,83,Blah-blah:,"Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.
"
3,5,84,Barney:,"Oh, here we go.
"
3,5,85,Blah-blah:,"Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.
"
3,5,86,Barney:,"Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.
"
3,5,87,Blah-blah:,"These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?
"
3,5,88,Robin:,"Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?
"
3,5,89,Blah-blah:,"I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?
"
3,5,90,Robin:,"Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.
"
3,5,91,Blah-blah:,"Wow, that just came out of nowhere.
"
3,5,92,Robin:,"No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.
"
3,5,93,Blah-blah:,"I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?
"
3,5,94,Robin:,"No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.
"
3,5,95,Blah-blah:,"Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.
"
3,5,96,Ted:,"You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.
"
3,5,97,Barney:,"OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.
"
3,5,98,Barney:,"Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.
"
3,5,99,Ted:,"Oh, I'm sorry about that.
"
3,5,100,Barney:,"No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.
"
3,5,101,Ted:,"Oh man, I'm really sorry.
"
3,5,102,Barney:,"Wow, you bought that?
"
3,5,103,Ted:,"What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?
"
3,5,104,Ted:,"Ted.
"
3,5,105,Barney:,"Are you a total idiot, Ted?
"
3,5,106,Ted:,"Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: (laughs) Well played.
"
3,5,107,Barney:,"I like you Ted.
"
3,5,108,Barney:,"Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.
"
3,5,109,Barney:,"Barney. We met at the urinal.
"
3,5,110,Ted:,"Oh right, hi.
"
3,5,111,Barney:,"Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.
"
3,5,112,Ted:,"I'm not wearing a suit.
"
3,5,113,Barney:,"Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.
"
3,5,114,Barney:,"Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.
"
3,5,115,Barney:,"Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.
"
3,5,116,Barney:,"(yelling at Ted) Edward, this is Audrey.
"
3,5,117,Audrey:,"You know, I actually know some sign language.
"
3,5,118,Audrey:,"(signing) Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you
"
3,5,119,Barney:,"He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.
"
3,5,120,Ted:,"(signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.
"
3,5,121,Barney:,"What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.
"
3,5,122,Ted:,"(signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.
"
3,5,123,Audrey:,"Here. Call me.
"
3,5,124,Barney:,"And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.
"
3,5,125,Ted:,"Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.
"
3,5,126,Ted:,"(signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.
"
3,5,127,Barney:,"Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.
"
3,5,128,Blah-blah:,"Oh my God, you told them.
"
3,5,129,Ted:,"OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.
"
3,5,130,Barney:,"Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?
"
3,5,131,Blah-blah:,"Wait, you guys dated. For how long?
"
3,5,132,Robin:,"A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?
"
3,5,133,Blah-blah:,"Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.
"
3,5,134,Ted:,"Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.
"
3,5,135,Barney:,"Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.
"
3,5,136,Barney:,"She started the night here
"
3,5,137,Barney:,"But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.
"
3,5,138,Barney:,"Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.
"
3,5,139,Ted:,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.
"
3,5,140,Blah-blah:,"Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.
"
3,5,141,Blah-blah:,"I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.
"
3,5,142,Ted:,"Their story is not as magical as it seems.
"
3,5,143,Blah-blah:,"What do you mean?
"
3,5,144,Ted:,"No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.
"
3,5,145,Blah-blah:,"Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.
"
3,5,146,Ted:,"The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.
"
3,5,147,College Ted:,"Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist.
"
3,5,148,College Lily:,"Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220.
"
3,5,149,College Ted:,"No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by.
"
3,5,150,College Lily:,"Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.
"
3,5,151,College students:,"Chug chug chug chug
"
3,5,152,College Ted:,"These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe.
"
3,5,153,College Lily:,"Oh, it's fruity.
"
3,5,154,College Ted:,"Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong.
"
3,5,155,College Lily:,"So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?
"
3,5,156,College Ted:,"Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, ""In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know."" You know?
"
3,5,157,College Lily:,"Wow.
"
3,5,158,Ted:,"As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.
"
3,5,159,Blah-blah:,"Oh my God.
"
3,5,160,Ted:,"Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?
"
3,5,161,Blah-blah:,"You have to tell Marshall.
"
3,5,162,Ted:,"If he heard that, it would destroy him.
"
3,5,163,Blah-blah:,"If you don't tell him, I will.
"
3,5,164,Ted:,"Oh, come on, you wouldn't.
"
3,5,165,Ted:,"Oh no.
"
3,5,166,Blah-blah:,"So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.
"
3,5,167,Ted:,"I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.
"
3,5,168,Lily:,"Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.
"
3,5,169,College Ted:,"I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says.
"
3,5,170,College Ted:,"In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail.
"
3,5,171,College Marshall:,"Ted, this is Lily.
"
3,5,172,College Ted:,"No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen.
"
3,5,173,Ted:,"Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?
"
3,5,174,Blah-blah:,"That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.
"
3,5,175,Marshall:,"Tell us what?
"
3,5,176,Ted:,"Lily, will you help us get the next round?
"
3,5,177,Lily:,"Ted, what's going on?
"
3,5,178,Ted:,"She knows about us, about how we really met.
"
3,5,179,Lily:,"Yeah, I know, I just told her.
"
3,5,180,Ted:,"No, the real story.
"
3,5,181,Lily:,"Ted, what are you talking about?
"
3,5,182,Ted:,"Lily, come on.
"
3,5,183,Lily:,"Come on what?
"
3,5,184,Ted:,"Lily, come on.
"
3,5,185,Lily:,"Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.
"
3,5,186,Ted:,"Lily, come on.
"
3,5,187,Blah-blah:,"I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.
"
3,5,188,Lily:,"What? Ted and I never made out.
"
3,5,189,Ted:,"Yeah, we did.
"
3,5,190,Lily:,"I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.
"
3,5,191,Ted:,"What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.
"
3,5,192,Lily:,"That wasn't me.
"
3,5,193,Ted:,"Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.
"
3,5,194,Lily:,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no.
"
3,5,195,Barney:,"How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.
"
3,5,196,Barney:,"It was right over there.
"
3,5,197,Barney:,"Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.
"
3,5,198,Marshall:,"I'm sorry, who are you again?
"
3,5,199,Ted:,"This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.
"
3,5,200,Barney:,"I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.
"
3,5,201,Ted:,"You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.
"
3,5,202,Barney:,"No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.
"
3,5,203,Ted:,"So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?
"
3,5,204,Marshall:,"I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.
"
3,5,205,Barney:,"Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.
"
3,5,206,Barney:,"How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.
"
3,5,207,Marshall:,"You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.
"
3,5,208,Barney:,"Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.
"
3,5,209,Barney:,"Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.
"
3,5,210,Barney:,"That man is a god.
"
3,5,211,Marshall:,"For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.
"
3,5,212,Barney:,"I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.
"
3,5,213,Lily:,"Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private?
"
3,5,214,Marshall:,"Yeah, of course, what's wrong?
"
3,5,215,Blah-blah:,"Lily and Ted made out. What do you think of that, Robin? Marshall: What are you talking about? Lily: You know that guy I made out with at the freshman orientation party?
"
3,5,216,Marshall:,"Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah.
"
3,5,217,Ted:,"And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?
"
3,5,218,Marshall:,"Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.
"
3,5,219,Ted:,"I'm too-much-tongue guy.
"
3,5,220,Lily:,"And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.
"
3,5,221,Barney:,"Worst superheroes ever.
"
3,5,222,Lily:,"Baby, I am so sorry.
"
3,5,223,Marshall:,"I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.
"
3,5,224,Ted:,"Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.
"
3,5,225,Lily:,"Are you sure? Marshall: If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man.
"
3,5,226,Blah-blah:,"(to Ted) You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily.
"
3,5,227,Ted:,"I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.
"
3,5,228,Blah-blah:,"Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me.
"
3,5,229,Barney:,"World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?
"
3,5,230,Warrior Avatar:,"We should grab some coffee sometime...
"
3,5,231,Female Avatar:,"Yes, we should.
"
3,5,232,Warrior Avatar:,"What's your name?
"
3,5,233,Female Avatar:,"Ted. What's yours?
"
3,5,234,Ted:,"Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game.
"
3,5,235,Future Ted VO:,"So, suffice it to say, Blah-blah did not turn out to be your mother. As for the girl I made out with at the party...
"

3,11,23,Barney:,"Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is ""love thy neighbor"", ok?... Now the golden rule is ""love thy neigbor"". But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: ""never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor.""

3,11,221,Barney:,"Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.
"
3,11,222,Wendy:,"If you need anything else, let me know.
"
3,11,223,Ted:,"waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.
"
3,11,224,Barney:,"She's gonna try to kill me. This is poisoned.
"
3,11,225,Ted:,"What? You're being ridiculous.
"
3,11,226,Barney:,"Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to kill me and everyone close to me.
"
3,11,227,Ted:,"What are you talking about?
"
3,11,228,Barney:,"Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says ""no hard feelings"". She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?
"
3,11,229,Ted:,"Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?
"
3,11,230,Barney:,"Where did Marshall get that hamburger?
"
3,11,231,Ted:,"I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.
"
3,11,232,"Barney (in slow motion, comes towards Marshall):","Noooooooo! (He throws his hamburger away)
"
3,11,233,Marshall:,"Dude.
"
3,11,234,Barney:,"You're welcome.
"
3,11,235,Robin:,"Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?
"
3,11,236,Barney:,"Yet.
"
3,11,237,Robin:,"You're an idiot.
"
3,11,238,Ted:,"All right, i'm taking off.
"
3,11,239,Barney:,"What?
"
3,11,240,Ted:,"I have a date. (Barney brushes Ted's hair in a mess)
"
3,11,241,Ted:,"You're such a jerk!
"
3,11,242,Barney:,"Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.
"
3,11,243,Ted:,"Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule. (He watches himself in th mirror) PS: you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. (He leaves)
"
3,11,244,Narrator:,"So Stella and i went on our date. But here's the funny thing: turns out, it wasn't actually a date.
"
3,11,245,[TITLE:,"3 hours later- The apartment- All]
"
3,11,246,Marshall:,"So what do you mean ""it wasn't a date""?
"
3,11,247,Ted:,"She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.
"
3,11,248,Marshall:,"Why would she think that?
"
3,11,249,Robin:,"Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?
"
3,11,250,Ted:,"Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.
"
3,11,251,Barney:,"Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.
"
3,11,252,Ted:,"No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.
"
3,11,253,Lily:,"Oh, sorry Ted.
"
3,11,254,Ted:,"It's okay. What are you guys watching?
"
3,11,255,Narrator:,"So that was the end of the story between me and Stella, at least for the time being. But i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule, i think there's a ninth step. We'll call it coexistence. It's the moment you realize that all that anger and resentment just isn't useful.
"
3,11,256,Robin:,"Thanks for watching.
"
3,11,257,Curt:,"Good night.
"
3,11,258,Narrator:,"and you start to let go of it.
"
3,11,259,Marshall&Lily (to Michael&Laura):,"Hey guys!
"
3,11,260,Lily:,"So what do you guys have going on tonight?
"
3,11,261,Laura:,"We're going to have a few friends over.
"
3,11,262,Michael:,"gonna play some charades.
"
3,11,263,Marshall:,"Have fun.
"
3,11,264,Narrator:,"And move on with your life.
"
3,11,265,Narrator:,"It just takes a while.
"
3,11,266,(Wendy comes to the table and offers a drink to Barney):,"On the house.
"
3,11,267,Barney:,"Thanks. (She leaves and he throws the drink) Crazy!
"
