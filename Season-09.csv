"
9,10,3,NARRATOR:,"A few years back, Barney's brother James finally met his long-lost father, Sam, who turned out to be a reverend.
"

9,4,5,ROBIN:,"Oh, who's that for?
"
9,4,6,NARRATOR:,"Kids, as you may recall, whenever Marshall left town for a few days, Lily would compensate with a body pillow she dressed up and named Marshpillow.

"
9,4,17,MARSHALL:,"Now, although not expressly stated in the Bro Code, a weird moment between a bro and his bro's fiancée is, in my bropinion... a violation.
"
9,4,18,BARNEY:,"Marshall, why are we doing this?!
"
9,4,19,BOTH:,"I hate the Boston Bruins!
"
9,4,20,NARRATOR:,"As she watched Robin make a new friend, Lily was happy... for two seconds.

9,5,6,NARRATOR:,"And not long after that, a package arrived.

9,5,7,NARRATOR:,"Which explains the face.
"
9,5,8,JAMES:,"Hey, Barney.

9,5,11,BARNEY:,"Ah.
"
9,5,12,ALL:,"Ooh!
"
9,5,13,MARSHALL:,"You, Ted Mosby, never got me and Lily a wedding gift!
"
9,5,14,I'm gonna tell you what I told Frampton's guitar tech when he couldn't find a condom:,"let's gamble.
"
9,5,15,NARRATOR:,"No thank you note.
"
9,5,16,NARRATOR:,"And she did.
"
9,5,17,Remember:,"happy wife equals happy life.

"
9,5,19,Robin? Two things:,"number one, are you dropping heat right now?
"
9,5,20,Step one:,"you let my mom win the ring back in a hand of poker.
"
9,5,21,"James, let me spell this out for you:","now that I've got Robin, we are not brothers anymore.

"
9,11,2,"Why, Marvin... MARSHALL:","She noted.
"
9,11,3,She asked timidly. He answered:,
9,11,4,TED:,"Psh, yeah, 'cause physics is so interesting.
"
9,11,5,ALL:,"Hooray! MARSHALL: We cheered.
"
9,11,6,MARSHALL:,"Ted thought back on past failed dates.
"
9,11,7,MARSHALL:,"And then, as Barney made some gestures that were rather rude, Ted left to go meet Lisa, in a rather puzzled mood.
"
9,11,8,TED:,"Mariano Rivera?
"
9,11,9,MARSHALL:,"And as she said...
"
9,11,10,All Ted could bring himself to think was:,
9,11,11,TED:,"Alfonso Soriano?
"
9,11,12,TED:,"Is it Joe Girardi?
"
9,11,13,MARSHALL:,"As Ted looked at that cell phone pic, there were two things he reckoned.
"
9,11,14,NARRATOR:,"I guess he had a point.
"
9,11,15,MAN:,"Hey, Robin, how's it going?
"
9,11,16,MARSHALL:,"He'd always been a deadbeat and your classic hoser phony, but seeing Simon all cleaned up hit Robin like a Zamboni.
"
9,11,17,"And as she tried to stammer some excuse to get away, Simon said:",
9,11,18,MARSHALL:,"Once more into the breach she surged, as Ted and Mommy cheered and bite by bite the towering confection disappeared.

9,11,19,Yeah. MARSHALL:,"Mom's exhortations rang like Apollo coaching Rocky 'gainst a frosted Clubber Lang.
"
9,11,20,"Hey, this is like that scene from Cool Hand Luke. You know, (Southern accent):","""My boy can eat 50 eggs "" Right?
"
9,11,21,MARSHALL:,"And now that night's remembered not for Robin getting dumped but as the night we took her in to get her stomach pumped.
"
9,11,22,At least we know one thing for sure:,"things can't get worse, I swear.
"
9,11,23,"As Barney put it, oh so eloquently:",
9,11,24,He rose to go approach this girl commanding such intrigue when Mommy interrupted:,
9,11,25,So many great things 'bout this girl:,"her boobs, her rack, her chest.
"
9,11,26,"As I departed, having bid this busty babe buh-bye, I stopped and looked around, and wondered:",
9,11,27,"The sign read 22nd Street, and my concern decreased until a cold wind blew a branch aside, revealing:","""East.""
"
9,11,28,BARNEY:,"No! Not fair.
"
9,11,29,And such a better dresser. TED:,"Sorry, dude, but that's revenge for Lisa the professor.
"
9,11,30,Yes. MARSHALL:,"Your mommy said.
"
9,11,31,BUS DRIVER:,"Sorry, folks, flat tire.
"
9,11,32,NARRATOR:,"And that, kids, is the very first thing your cousin Marvin remembers.
