5,20,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, everybody has at least a moment to take a huge decision, a crazy decision that will change their lives forever. This is a story of mine.
"
5,20,2,Ted (2030):,"It all started with a visit to my mother and her boyfriend for a long time, Clint, who always said things in the style...
"
5,20,3,Clint:,"Ted, your mother is really a woman... really erotic boy.
"
5,20,4,Ted:,"Please do not.
"
5,20,5,Clint:,"As a painter, slash, composer, slash, voluntary combatant with fear. I find it incredibly... sensual. But you have s*x own memories of your mother, right?
"
5,20,6,Ted:,"Please, stop.
"
5,20,7,Clint:,"Exciting her nipple, receiving her milk. You follow me?Fine.
"
5,20,8,Mother:,"I can not believe I'm with this man.
"
5,20,9,Ted:,"Mom, mom, it's good. You're not obliged to ask you with him. There's full of guys...
"
5,20,10,Mother:,"It's so cool! And he chooses!
"
5,20,11,Ted:,"Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy.
"
5,20,12,Clint:,"Oh, well... because that was an ad to make you... Son.
"
5,20,13,Ted (2030):,"Yes, my mother was lapping. I married for the second time before I get married once. I was so happy for them.f*cking happy. While weddings can be magical. As far as I know, I'll end up dancing with my future wife in this marriage.
"
5,20,14,Woman:,"And if you do not boil the jars of jam, it will be a haven for bacteria.
"
5,20,15,Ted (2030):,"It was not her.
"
5,20,16,Lily:,"Oh, congratulations!
"
5,20,17,Marshall:,"We're so happy for you!
"
5,20,18,Mother:,"I feel like my 19 years. It is as if the past 35 years had never happened.
"
5,20,19,Ted:,"I love to listen to you, Mom.
"
5,20,20,Clint:,"Son, to show you that your mother and I will always be there for you, I want you to have this beautiful picture I have painted.
"
5,20,21,Ted (2030):,"Children, there was no guitar.
"
5,20,22,Clint:,"I'm sorry, Ted.
"
5,20,23,Robin:,"Best...
"
5,20,24,Marshall:,".. marriage...
"
5,20,25,Lily:,".. never...
"
5,20,26,Barney:,".. seen.
"
5,20,27,Clint:,"Hello everyone. Mahallow to be there with us. Throughout my life, well, this life. I waited a muse as Virginia. Girl... this is your song.
"
5,20,28,Ted:,"Oh my God.
"
5,20,29,Ted (2030):,"Children, I swear, I remember the 12 minutes following. So I have no idea of the end of the song.
"
5,20,30,"Clint, singing:","And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you.
"
5,20,31,Barney:,"Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.
"
5,20,32,Barney:,"You're currently whining?
"
5,20,33,Robin:,"I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?
"
5,20,34,Barney:,"Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.
"
5,20,35,Barney:,"And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!
"
5,20,36,Ted (2030):,"Children, I can not exaggerate how horrible it is to be a single guy in his mother's second marriage.
"
5,20,37,Man:,"So, Ted, when you get married?
"
5,20,38,Male 2:,"So, Ted, when you get married?
"
5,20,39,Woman:,"You marry when?
"
5,20,40,Woman 2:,"You marry when?
"
5,20,41,Older woman:,"You marry when?
"
5,20,42,Barney:,"Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!
"
5,20,43,Ted:,"I gotta go.
"
5,20,44,Marshall:,"Wait, Ted. And your speech?
"
5,20,45,Ted:,"Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it.
"
5,20,46,Marshall:,"Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!
"
5,20,47,Barney:,"Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty.
"
5,20,48,Ted (2030):,"And my friends I have not seen during the next 72 hours.
"
5,20,49,Lily:,"Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence.
"
5,20,50,Robin:,"I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.
"
5,20,51,Barney:,"Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional. (He gives her a stack of paper towels) Shh. Leave it alone.
"
5,20,52,Robin:,"Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.
"
5,20,53,Barney:,"She cried to the song of Clint.
"
5,20,54,Ted:,"Hi, guys.
"
5,20,55,Lily:,"Ted, where were you?
"
5,20,56,Robin:,"Is that okay?
"
5,20,57,Ted:,"Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look!
"
5,20,58,Marshall:,"Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license?
"
5,20,59,Lily:,"Yeah, but where we're going to end?
"
5,20,60,Ted:,"First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.
"
5,20,61,Ted:,"Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.
"
5,20,62,All:,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Ted, come! Oh, my god!
"
5,20,63,Lily:,"We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone.
"
5,20,64,Ted:,"I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.
"
5,20,65,Ted:,"I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.
"
5,20,66,Ted:,"Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.
"
5,20,67,Lily:,"What, are you saying that you bought the house?
"
5,20,68,Ted:,"I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.
"
5,20,69,Barney:,"And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?
"
5,20,70,Marshall:,"Try not to laugh with you that, man.
"
5,20,71,Ted:,"So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.
"
5,20,72,Robin:,"Whoa.
"
5,20,73,Lily:,"Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.
"
5,20,74,Ted:,"I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.
"
5,20,75,Barney:,"Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?
"
5,20,76,Ted:,"Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.
"
5,20,77,Marshall:,"Look out, man.
"
5,20,78,Lily:,"Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.
"
5,20,79,Robin:,"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.
"
5,20,80,Barney:,"The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.
"
5,20,81,Marshall:,"Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?
"
5,20,82,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
5,20,83,Marshall:,"Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.
"
5,20,84,Robin:,"My God, you had to be completely stuffed.
"
5,20,85,Barney:,"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.
"
5,20,86,Robin:,"Children? Why...
"
5,20,87,Barney:,"Put rockets in...
"
5,20,88,Marshall:,"Oh, my God, guys! Great new game: ""Drunk or child? ""I was what? Guess.
"
5,20,89,Lily:,"Bourre.
"
5,20,90,Robin:,"Bourre.
"
5,20,91,Barney:,"Gamin.
"
5,20,92,Ted:,"Gamin.
"
5,20,93,Marshall:,"Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!
"
5,20,94,Barney:,"You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.
"
5,20,95,Robin:,"It was not me!
"
5,20,96,Lily:,"What?
"
5,20,97,Robin:,"It's not me who cried during the song Clint.
"
5,20,98,Robin:,"Are you crying?
"
5,20,99,Barney:,"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?
"
5,20,100,Robin:,"Not as much as me.
"
5,20,101,Barney:,"I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.
"
5,20,102,Robin:,"$ 500? No worries.
"
5,20,103,Barney:,"Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.
"
5,20,104,Barney:,"Wait, you're...
"
5,20,105,Man going:,"Hi, I'm here for inspection.
"
5,20,106,Ted:,"Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.
"
5,20,107,Man:,"Well I'm here for a while, but I think the bell does not work.
"
5,20,108,Ted:,"Hmm.
"
5,20,109,Man:,"Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.
"
5,20,110,Barney:,"Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?
"
5,20,111,Ted:,"Well, yeah.
"
5,20,112,All:,"Hey! Hey! Hey!
"
5,20,113,Marshall:,"Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.
"
5,20,114,Marshall:,"I was...
"
5,20,115,Mother:,"Marshall is dead! Marshall died!
"
5,20,116,Marshall:,"A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.
"
5,20,117,Ted:,"Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.
"
5,20,118,Marshall:,"Hmm... sausage party?
"
5,20,119,Ted:,"Burgers, burgers will be made.
"
5,20,120,Lily:,"Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.
"
5,20,121,Ted:,"Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really sh1t to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.
"
5,20,122,Marshall:,"Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.
"
5,20,123,Robin:,"Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?
"
5,20,124,Man:,"Yeah, you have leaky pipes. But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by.
"
5,20,125,Lily:,"You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.
"
5,20,126,Ted:,"You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?
"
5,20,127,Marshall:,"I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.
"
5,20,128,Man:,"Not so fast. (He brings Lily in the room) was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.
"
5,20,129,Ted:,"But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.
"
5,20,130,Barney:,"It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.
"
5,20,131,Robin:,"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?
"
5,20,132,Barney:,"Of course.
"
5,20,133,Robin:,"I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.
"
5,20,134,Lily:,"Boy, you've almost had us still.
"
5,20,135,Marshall:,"You're always a little too far.
"
5,20,136,Barney:,"sh1t.
"
5,20,137,Man:,"Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.
"
5,20,138,Ted:,"Really?
"
5,20,139,Man:,"Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here.
"
5,20,140,Ted:,"And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?
"
5,20,141,Man:,"I'll see at the top if all goes well.
"
5,20,142,Marshall:,"He said he had found a tramp?
"
5,20,143,Ted:,"Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.
"
5,20,144,Barney:,"I see a complaint.
"
5,20,145,Man:,"Found termites.
"
5,20,146,Robin:,"Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has killed some cockroaches at the time of impact.
"
5,20,147,Lily:,"Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.
"
5,20,148,Ted:,"You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?
"
5,20,149,Barney:,"Thank you. My God.
"
5,20,150,Ted:,"Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.
"
5,20,151,Barney:,"OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.
"
5,20,152,Ted:,"What do you mean?
"
5,20,153,Barney:,"Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.
"
5,20,154,Ted:,"Please, stop.
"
5,20,155,Barney:,"Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.
"
5,20,156,Ted:,"What are you talking about?
"
5,20,157,Barney:,"I wanted to be your father!
"
5,20,158,Ted:,"What does that mean?
"
5,20,159,Barney:,"Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.
"
5,20,160,Barney:,"And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.
"
5,20,161,Virginia:,"Here we go.
"
5,20,162,Barney:,"It is a good time. Not much traffic...
"
5,20,163,Virginia:,"Oh, I love this song.
"
5,20,164,Barney:,"Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...
"
5,20,165,Virginia:,"Your pen1s is huge.
"
5,20,166,Marshall:,"Again?! One too many!
"
5,20,167,Barney:,"Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar.
"
5,20,168,Robin:,"Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.
"
5,20,169,Barney:,"Okay, this is a Mellencamp.
"
5,20,170,Ted:,"Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.
"
5,20,171,Lily:,"Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all?
"
5,20,172,Ted:,"It's silly.
"
5,20,173,Barney:,"Your mother and I were at second base.
"
5,20,174,Ted:,"Thank you Lily. It was fantastic.
"
5,20,175,Lily:,"A Ted Mosby, owner, friends, and if he can rent it, Slumlord.
"
5,20,176,Ted:,"There... there is one last thing I should do.
"
5,20,177,Ted (2030):,"And my friends have not seen during the next 72 hours.
"
5,20,178,Robin:,"It was our turn.
"
5,20,179,Ted:,"Hi.
"
5,20,180,Virginia:,"Ted, what are you doing here?
"
5,20,181,Ted:,"I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... ""A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... ""I pass. ""Mom, I love you, and I've never seen him so happy with Clint. And Clint, welcome in the family... what you both is what I'd really like to have someday. But in the meantime, health to you both. I love you. ""
"
5,20,182,Virginia:,"Ted... I'm so there... cooked. I'm 60% sure only that you're there before me. But if you're here, I love you. And you're the best son a mother could have.
"
5,20,183,Ted (2030):,"There was no reason why my mother could be with a guy like that. However, as you know children, be with Grandpa Clint was the best decision taken what did your grandmother.(Ted returns to the house he bought) Sometimes our best decisions are those that really have no meaning.
"
5,20,184,Ted:,"Hey.
"
5,20,185,Marshall:,"Hey, man.
"
5,20,186,Ted:,"How did you know that I would be here today?
"
5,20,187,Marshall:,"Robin told me. Happy Housewarming!
"
5,20,188,Ted:,"But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home.
"
5,20,189,Marshall:,"I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Listen... for all time, all the years I have told you... ""Slow! Not go too fast with this girl! ""You've not heard a single f*cking time. Your heart is both drunk and child.
"
5,20,190,Ted:,"Please stay here with me, man.
"
5,20,191,Marshall:,"That's what I do.
"
5,20,192,Ted:,"I can... I can give you some ideas I have?
"
5,20,193,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
5,20,194,Ted (2030):,"And, children, Marshall was right. I have not given up my dream home because that's the thing with the stupid decisions. It makes them all. But time is funny. And sometimes a little magic. It may take a stupid decision... and turn it into something sensible. For children, as you know, this house... our house is.
"
5,8,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, go out with someone for this is simple. We must be confident, good about yourself, and course of who you are. Uncle Barney was very good on this last point, although many times it was someone else.
"
5,8,2,Lily:,"You see that guy over there in diving suit? You think you're going to go talk to him?
"
5,8,3,Woman:,"No.
"
5,8,4,Lily:,"Okay. This is certainly the biggest con on this planet.
"
5,8,5,Woman:,"How do you know?
"
5,8,6,Lily:,"This is one of my best friends.
"
5,8,7,Woman:,"And the diving suit?
"
5,8,8,Lily:,"It's a long story. You see, he just break...
"
5,8,9,Ted (2030):,"There are two basic ways to behave after a breakup.Some are dedicated solely to...
"
5,8,10,Robin:,"My career. This is my new priority. From now on, more a date. The job.
"
5,8,11,Ted (2030):,"While others are dedicated solely to...
"
5,8,12,Barney:,"All women of New York. That's right, Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mother, lock your daughters. Daughters, lock your MAQACENJaR.
"
5,8,13,Marshall:,"MAQACENJaR?
"
5,8,14,Ted:,"Wait, I can find. With Mothers Who I'd like Sunset And Never Forgot.
"
5,8,15,Barney:,"You have the right answer!
"
5,8,16,Lily:,"You're not rush a little, then?
"
5,8,17,Barney:,"Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles.
"
5,8,18,Barney:,"The Roles book contains all the scams, trickery, deception, underhand, cunning, nonsense, and embobinages tricks I used, or expected use, to nab the girls and do their business.
"
5,8,19,Marshall:,"You're writing another book? Stephen King was one right there.
"
5,8,20,Barney:,"It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca...
"
5,8,21,Barney:,"Do not drink it. I saw a guy put something.
"
5,8,22,Woman:,"What? Who?
"
5,8,23,Barney:,"This guy.
"
5,8,24,Woman:,"Thank you.
"
5,8,25,Barney:,".. Until more advanced maneuvers, such as the Ms. Stinsfire.
"
5,8,26,Women:,"Kappas, after our disciplinary hearing on obscene behavior last semester, we welcome a new housekeeper. I present to you Ms. Stinsfire.
"
5,8,27,Ms. Stinsfire:,"Hello, girls!
"
5,8,28,Marshall:,"I do not see how it could not walk.
"
5,8,29,Ted:,"What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
"
5,8,30,Barney:,"Glad you asked. The Lorenzon Von Matterhorn will be my comeback on stage. Or, you know, in my bed. In fact, my bed is on a stage. I put it on a platform and installed lighting. A real production. Barney goes!
"
5,8,31,Marshall:,"And you Robin? You leave it in play? Where is your book of Roles?
"
5,8,32,Robin:,"My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here.
"
5,8,33,Ted:,"A great book.
"
5,8,34,Lily:,"Yeah, I'm reading it.
"
5,8,35,Robin:,"So, I have told you, I take a break on that side.
"
5,8,36,Ted:,"It's going to happen.
"
5,8,37,Marshall:,"Bluntly.
"
5,8,38,Robin:,"What?
"
5,8,39,Ted:,"You'll fall in love.
"
5,8,40,Marshall:,"Very soon.
"
5,8,41,Robin:,"It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards.
"
5,8,42,Ted:,"We play Pyramid. What people are saying just before meeting the love.
"
5,8,43,Marshall:,"Kelly Harris, a fellow law school, said... ""The law school is too hard, I want to focus on courses. ""Six months later?Married!
"
5,8,44,Robin:,"It's good but...
"
5,8,45,Ted:,"Travis Frenchroy, replacing bartender told me... ""I'm done with all these rencards. I want to concentrate on my fan fiction of Star Trek. ""Six months later... Married!
"
5,8,46,Robin:,"I answer? It's good for them...
"
5,8,47,Marshall:,"Matthew Blitz, accounting job, said... ""I will die alone.To focus as much on taxes this year. ""Six months later? PACS and plans to marry pending the enactment of the Act currently in the Senate from New York!
"
5,8,48,Ted:,"It happens, whatever you say. It is a law of nature.
"
5,8,49,Marshall:,"Judged. By nature.
"
5,8,50,Ted:,"Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single.
"
5,8,51,Lily:,"Okay. Are you ready?
"
5,8,52,Ted:,"Ready for what?
"
5,8,53,Lily:,"Three years ago, Shelly started working at my school.When I saw her, I said, ""It's perfect for Ted.""
"
5,8,54,Ted:,"Why do not you talk to me now?
"
5,8,55,Shelly:,"I usually hate rencards arranged but Ted looks great.
"
5,8,56,Lily:,"He is. It is so great and attentive and intelligent.
"
5,8,57,Marshall:,"Another chicken and stick to you the crown!
"
5,8,58,Lily:,"I do not see it. It must be voluntary. So, another bar?
"
5,8,59,"Ted, with chicken fingers in the mouth:","This girl is super nice with Lily!
"
5,8,60,Ted:,"Yeah she was pretty.
"
5,8,61,Lily:,"It still is. And you're ready.
"
5,8,62,Marshall:,"But you can put three times more than chicken fingers in your mouth. You know.
"
5,8,63,Lily:,"I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid.
"
5,8,64,Ted:,"I promise to do anything stupid.
"
5,8,65,Ted (2030):,"And I kept that promise. But just because... it never came.
"
5,8,66,Shelly:,"I know. I'm sorry, I am ashamed.
"
5,8,67,Lily:,"You should!
"
5,8,68,Shelly:,"This is the case!
"
5,8,69,Lily:,"You should! You should!
"
5,8,70,Shelly:,"This is the case, it does! This is false. I could not wait to meet Ted but I arrived at the bar an hour early and I met this great guy. Kind, serious genius.
"
5,8,71,Lily:,"And you met him at McLaren's?
"
5,8,72,Shelly:,"Just at the bar.
"
5,8,73,Lily:,"What is the name there?
"
5,8,74,Shelly:,"I should not say. And sh1t. This is Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!
"
5,8,75,Lily:,"You... dirty b*st*rd.
"
5,8,76,Woman:,"So, he got Shelly? It must have upset you.
"
5,8,77,Lily:,"Bluntly.
"
5,8,78,Lily:,"I had put aside for Ted Shelly for 3 years.
"
5,8,79,Barney:,"My hen, Ted did not miss much. She is brainy, boring, a bit boring in bed. In fact it would have been perfect for Ted.Oops! (Lily hits him) If I had known she was there for Ted, I would have obviously not done, but... given the circumstances, I think Ted would be proud of me. I managed The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
"
5,8,80,Woman:,"What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
"
5,8,81,Lily:,"Exactly, yes.
"
5,8,82,Lily:,"What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
"
5,8,83,Barney:,"Glad you asked.
"
5,8,84,Barney:,"To achieve the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn is what you need, basic knowledge in web design and a truly unique fake name. So think about your fake name right away. You? Fine.Now choose your target. (It is now at the bar) Preferably a girl with a great big... phone. (He approaches the counter Shelly installed) Yeah that's me.
"
5,8,85,Shelly:,"I know you?
"
5,8,86,Barney:,"I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
"
5,8,87,Shelly:,"You are, kind known?
"
5,8,88,Barney:,"Yes. You do not know who I am, does not it? It feels good for once. Nice to meet you...
"
5,8,89,Shelly:,"Shelly.
"
5,8,90,Barney:,"Shelly? Again, I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. It is written as it is pronounced, with two ""T"". (He leaves) Then, once you leave, she takes out her phone and tries Lorenzo Von Matterhorn on the Internet. And that's when she discovers... A series of fake websites, all devoted to the incredible life of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. A false item of business on Lorenzo, the hermit billionaire. The fake of the Explorer Club newsletter on his trip to the North Pole in an airship, a feat of imagination and challenge. The fake medical journal with a story to make you cry the doctors saying that a reduction of the pen1s is not an option. And time to return... (Barney returns to Shelly) I hate to be cheeky, but I can offer you a coffee?
"
5,8,91,Shelly:,"Yes! Please.
"
5,8,92,Barney:,"How much is a coffee today, $ 50? And here we go.
"
5,8,93,Lily:,"It's horrible. You realize you've broken her heart? She is inconsolable.
"
5,8,94,Barney:,"Why would it be inconsolable? The airship of Lorenzo will not disappear in the Arctic for a week. Sorry if this is that someone told her that it was lies.
"
5,8,95,Shelly:,"It was all lies?
"
5,8,96,Lily:,"It was all lies.
"
5,8,97,Shelly:,"The expedition in the airship?
"
5,8,98,Lily:,"Lies!
"
5,8,99,Shelly:,"The artificial island in the shape of his face off Dubai?
"
5,8,100,Lily:,"Lies!
"
5,8,101,Shelly:,"Finishing third in the contest of Laser Tag?
"
5,8,102,Lily:,"Men... Actually, that's true. I went there.
"
5,8,103,Shelly:,"You went to the Vatican?
"
5,8,104,Lily:,"Lies!
"
5,8,105,Barney:,"Oh my God! Well, I hope you are pleased with you.
"
5,8,106,Lily:,"What?
"
5,8,107,Barney:,"Thou hast broken my heart.
"
5,8,108,Lily:,"Me?
"
5,8,109,Barney:,"You! She will never trust a man. You've spoiled for Ted.Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn, the twin brother of Lorenzo.
"
5,8,110,Lily:,"Do you believe? He says it's my fault. And by the way, Ted, I bet she go out with you again.
"
5,8,111,Ted:,"I'm thinking. Do I want to date a girl that Barney was typed?Help me for harmonies. Of course.
"
5,8,112,"All, making the chorus:","No way...
"
5,8,113,Lily:,"That must bother you a bit.
"
5,8,114,Robin:,"It's his life. These girls had it coming if they are stupid enough to be fooled.
"
5,8,115,Marshall:,"I agree. You've seen one called The Sn&aring;sa?
"
5,8,116,Woman:,"You're an astronaut?
"
5,8,117,Barney:,"Actually, I'm in a top secret government space program called Secret NASA... Sn&aring;sa.
"
5,8,118,Woman:,"Sn&aring;sa? You went to the moon and everything?
"
5,8,119,Barney:,"No Moon you know, but I went on Slune.
"
5,8,120,Woman:,"The Slune.
"
5,8,121,Robin:,"If you fall in there, you break my heart, but sorry, you're sdébile.
"
5,8,122,Woman:,"So, then?
"
5,8,123,Lily:,"Well, Barney, you go out... You just get out of a sincere relationship. You're a big boy now. You can return to your towers to two euros.
"
5,8,124,Barney:,"Tours to two euros?! None of these towers is. The Tower A except two Euros.
"
5,8,125,Barney:,"I am the bassist for Tower Two Euros. And even that involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you allow, I have to prepare for the event tonight. The I exécuterais he will not come.Glad you asked.
"
5,8,126,Barney:,"The To run it will not come, you will need the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Got it? Fine. For generations, this is the place chosen by New Yorkers for reunion with their lost lovers of view, you need to go to every girl and say, ""He will not come.""
"
5,8,127,Woman:,"What are you talking about?
"
5,8,128,Barney:,"Let it go. (He goes to another woman) He will not come.(Then another) He will not come. She's not coming? Sorry. (The woman leaves) Until... He will not come.
"
5,8,129,Woman:,"No? But we agreed. We always said we would meet again here. Tonight it. I'm an idiot.
"
5,8,130,Robin:,"I'll fetch the newspaper.
"
5,8,131,Ted:,"Or rather, look for a husband.
"
5,8,132,Marshall:,"Grave.
"
5,8,133,Robin:,"You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship.
"
5,8,134,Ted:,"Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours.
"
5,8,135,Marshall:,"It's like that. Have you any idea how many times in my life when I went to look for frozen waffles frozen in vain?
"
5,8,136,Robin:,"Thousands?
"
5,8,137,Marshall:,"Millions. But when I go in search of a mirror or the remote because Lily and I had an argument and she has hidden there, whereupon I fall? Frozen waffles. It's like that. You go out to get the newspaper, but you come back with frozen waffles.And there, frozen waffles he's a guy. As long as you're there, you take it back frozen waffles? And there, frozen waffles are... frozen waffles.
"
5,8,138,"Barney, entering:","Everyone, code red! Emergency. Lock.Nobody gets out.
"
5,8,139,Robin:,"What happened?
"
5,8,140,Barney:,"I tried the he will not come, and it worked. Monstrous.You should have seen this girl.
"
5,8,141,Robin:,"I'm leaving.
"
5,8,142,Barney:,"So, we came up to me, and I go to my room to prepare the camera... lighting candles... and when I go out, nobody, paper and more roles! We all know who is responsible for that.
"
5,8,143,Lily:,"Yes, we know.
"
5,8,144,Barney:,"Al-Qaeda.
"
5,8,145,Lily:,"No, you idiot. That was me.
"
5,8,146,Barney:,"You... enfoirée dirty!
"
5,8,147,Woman:,"You have stolen the Book of Roles? So, the daughter of the Empire State Building?
"
5,8,148,Lily:,"An actress friend.
"
5,8,149,Barney:,"An actress. Of course. That explains his perfect diction and style of Drag.
"
5,8,150,Lily:,"I'm almost to the point of taking this book and put it on the net for everyone to see.
"
5,8,151,Barney:,"You would not dare.
"
5,8,152,Lily:,"No, as you stop scams and confidence tricks, deception, underhand, tricks, schemes and embobinages.
"
5,8,153,Barney:,"You did not say nonsense.
"
5,8,154,Lily:,"No more nonsense!
"
5,8,155,Barney:,"Slim.
"
5,8,156,Robin:,"Sorry to interrupt but check it out.
"
5,8,157,Ted:,"No.
"
5,8,158,Barney:,"I was abandoned at the altar.
"
5,8,159,Ted:,"Oh, my god, it's horrible. I wonder if it works.
"
5,8,160,Marshall:,"And yet this is not the worst. Do you saw My pen1s grants wishes?
"
5,8,161,Woman:,"Really? A genie comes out?
"
5,8,162,Barney:,"Only if you rub hard enough.
"
5,8,163,Woman:,"And what happens after it?
"
5,8,164,Ted:,"He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him.
"
5,8,165,Marshall:,"It's not very well designed. This is not Ms. Stinsfire.
"
5,8,166,Woman:,"And in real life?
"
5,8,167,Lily:,"A few hours later...
"
5,8,168,Ted:,"Apparently, it will rain.
"
5,8,169,Barney:,"If you wonder, I would be at McLaren's playing a character from the Book of roles being called The Diver. That's all.
"
5,8,170,Lily:,"It's good. I put the Book of Roles on the Internet. Baby, you can put the Book of Roles on the Internet?
"
5,8,171,Marshall:,"Sure baby, but there is something odd. I flipped through the whole book. There is no role called The Diver.
"
5,8,172,Barney:,"Now you want to know what the diver. In fact, it was on the last page of the Book, but I pulled in case. But do not worry.You will see it in action. You see the blonde next to the bar?Cizzible repérizzée.
"
5,8,173,Lily:,"Barney, no. You are...
"
5,8,174,Barney:,"Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book.
"
5,8,175,Robin:,"I did not worship the book.
"
5,8,176,Barney:,"But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular.
"
5,8,177,Robin:,"We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke.
"
5,8,178,Barney:,"I did not know you felt it. I was so caught up with my own projects as... Damn, she looks out there. Quickly dispersed.
"
5,8,179,Lily:,"It's good. You see that guy over there in diving suit?
"
5,8,180,Lily:,"And here we are.
"
5,8,181,Woman:,"Wait. Why he wears a wetsuit?
"
5,8,182,Marshall:,"I have no idea. And it's killing us, Claire. It kills us!
"
5,8,183,Claire:,"Let's ask him.
"
5,8,184,Lily:,"So what does the diver? Claire and here, in passing.
"
5,8,185,Barney:,"Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins bomb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind.
"
5,8,186,Robin:,"It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships.
"
5,8,187,Marshall:,"She is getting married.
"
5,8,188,Ted:,"I will prepare my toast.
"
5,8,189,Marshall:,"I have to check my tuxedo.
"
5,8,190,Robin:,"I'll knock your heads like two coconuts.
"
5,8,191,Lily:,"I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles.
"
5,8,192,Barney:,"Is it true? Claire, you must have heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want some coffee?
"
5,8,193,Lily:,"Before refusing, you should know that in this neoprene combined with what appears to be a pair of socks...
"
5,8,194,Barney:,"A Pringles, but still.
"
5,8,195,Lily:,".. is an incredible kind. He's funny and it's one of my best friends. And he came out with this gun.
"
5,8,196,Robin:,"It's a good guy.
"
5,8,197,Ted:,"Come on, go out with him.
"
5,8,198,Marshall:,"It's a coffee, huh?
"
5,8,199,Robin:,"It's nothing.
"
5,8,200,Claire:,"Okay, okay. Going for coffee.
"
5,8,201,Ted (2030):,"And at the end of the evening...
"
5,8,202,Marshall:,"I'm proud of him. It takes a lot of Pringles to be as vulnerable.
"
5,8,203,Lily:,"I had a message from Barney. ""Look under the table."" (She looks under the table and finds an envelope) A page from the Book of Roles.
"
5,8,204,Robin:,"It says what?
"
5,8,205,Ted:,"It's The Diver.
"
5,8,206,Barney:,"Step one, talk to a friend Book Roles. Step two, play with one of his colleagues and make angry she steals the Book.Step three, put the combi and say you will do a final round, The Diver with the sexy girl next to the bar. Your friend, let's call her Lily, told him everything about the book. Now the hard part.When Lily and daughter are questioning The Diver, remove the mask, and pull out the stops on your deepest insecurities that do not exist because you are awesome. Sad for you, Lily talks about you to the girl who agrees to have coffee. And... is... gone.
"
5,8,207,Lily:,"You dirty b*st*rd...!
"
5,8,208,Marshall:,"It is. You say you do not want a relationship. Well, the love of your life will not pass this door, and this is... this kind.
"
5,8,209,Robin:,"I will not fall in love with him.
"
5,8,210,Ted:,"Yes, because it is... this kind.
"
5,8,211,Robin:,"No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so...
"
5,8,212,Marshall:,"Right, because here it is. It is this type! (A woman enters) Let him at least a chance. Get out a bit with it, see if it can give something.
"
5,8,213,Robin:,"I will work.
"
5,8,214,Marshall:,"Yeah, right.
"
5,8,215,Robin:,"I'm really going to work.
"
5,8,216,Ted (2030):,"And the irony of history...
"
5,8,217,Man:,"You, Robin?
"
5,8,218,Robin:,"Yes.
"
5,8,219,Man:,"Don, new co-host.
"
5,8,220,Ted (2030):,"This was the day she met Don.
"
5,8,221,Robin:,"Damn, Marshall.
"
5,9,1,Ted (2030):,"In November 2009, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily celebrated their first Thanksgiving in their own apartment. And Marshall had found the perfect turkey.
"
5,9,2,Marshall:,"It's beautiful. She is 10 pounds. It is organic. Do you remember my uncle Heinrek bald? Looks like his head squarely.(The taxi hand) Oh, my God! My my turkey... turkey!
"
5,9,3,Ted (2030):,"So when we got to the big day, Marshall was rather depressed.
"
5,9,4,Robin:,"We brought the turkey.
"
5,9,5,Marshall:,"You have brought back an old turkey replacement.Why I have not listened to the message of former mayor Ed Koch saying not to forget my business.
"
5,9,6,Ted:,"With Robin we went to the objects found in the prefecture and there, sitting in their fridge... Is this your turkey?
"
5,9,7,Marshall:,"Yes! It's my turkey! Come here, my beautiful little enfoirée!
"
5,9,8,Lily:,"I'll go put it in the oven.
"
5,9,9,Marshall:,"You're the best friends in the world!
"
5,9,10,Barney:,"It was a team effort.
"
5,9,11,Marshall:,"I do not know what to say. It's Thanksgiving, but ""thank you"" does not seem enough.
"
5,9,12,Ted:,"You have done the same for us.
"
5,9,13,Marshall:,"Yes, and you know why? Because I love you. And I'll show you how. Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky, I bring you... the fourth slap.
"
5,9,14,Barney:,"Wait. What?
"
5,9,15,Ted (2030):,"Children Remember the slap bet to Marshall and Barney.
"
5,9,16,Ted (2030):,"When Barney lost, Marshall has earned the right to slap Barney five times as hard as he can. Until then, he had used three. The third was issued two years ago at Thanksgiving 2007. A day was appointed... Baffegiving.
"
5,9,17,Ted:,"You're saying...
"
5,9,18,Robin:,"What you think you say?
"
5,9,19,Marshall:,"Certainly not. Unless you were thinking... ""Baffegiving two: Revenge of the lower"" in this case, yes, that's what I'm saying!
"
5,9,20,Barney:,"The slaps are not transferable.
"
5,9,21,Marshall:,"Lily is the curator of the bet.
"
5,9,22,Lily:,"The slaps are transferable.
"
5,9,23,Robin and Ted:,"Transferable.
"
5,9,24,Robin:,"You realize that you will remain one. Are you sure you want to spend a day.
"
5,9,25,Marshall:,"Life is short. I tell myself, Baffe Diem. A rule, the slap must be given before sunset to avoid interference dinner Lily.
"
5,9,26,Lily:,"And how!
"
5,9,27,Marshall:,"Two, you must decide which of you will. Three, we will attach to the chair Barney, now be called The Throne of Baffe. It fits you?
"
5,9,28,Lily:,"Awesome.
"
5,9,29,Barney:,"Absolutely not!
"
5,9,30,Ted (2030):,"Everything was in place for this to be the best Thanksgiving. Until...
"
5,9,31,Lily:,"We expect someone else?
"
5,9,32,Ted (2030):,"It was someone with whom Lily had had no contact in three years.
"
5,9,33,Lily:,"Dad?
"
5,9,34,Ted (2030):,"Lily and her father, Mickey, have always had a difficult relationship.
"
5,9,35,Ted (2030):,"Mickey's dream was to invent the best game of American society. But his ideas were always weird.
"
5,9,36,Lily Young:,"Doo-Dah? You missed my dance recital.
"
5,9,37,Mickey:,"Yes, sweetie, but look! I just finished my new board game hit, ""The Merchant of Sleep in Tijuana.""
"
5,9,38,Lily Young:,"Doo-Dah? You missed my meeting gymnastics.
"
5,9,39,Mickey:,"Yes but it's good! ""Car Battery. How long can you hold?""Hey, Princess. Take that.
"
5,9,40,Lily Young:,"Doo-Dah? I had a nightmare.
"
5,9,41,Mickey:,"Well, just play the new game from Dad, ""There is a demon clown under the bed.""
"
5,9,42,Ted (2030):,"All his life, Mickey disappointed Lily. And she did it with, so far in 2006, when Lily went to see his grandparents.
"
5,9,43,Marshall:,"Rita, you are anxious... to move to Florida?
"
5,9,44,Rita:,"Well, my dear, slight change of plan. We stay here for now.
"
5,9,45,Voice:,"The straw of my mini-juice broke! Man, hurry! What a nice surprise.
"
5,9,46,Lily:,"What has happened with your apartment?
"
5,9,47,Mickey:,"I had a little problem with my roommate.
"
5,9,48,Lily:,"What has happened?
"
5,9,49,Mickey:,"He wanted me to pay rent. It has ended badly.
"
5,9,50,Lily:,"You should pay rent to live in the basement of your parents.
"
5,9,51,Mickey:,"It's not my first choice. With the old schnoques up there it's a little disturbing. They do not understand the trick of the sock on the handle.
"
5,9,52,Marshall:,"They surprised you with a girl?
"
5,9,53,Mickey:,"In a sense.
"
5,9,54,Lily:,"Working? You are retired.
"
5,9,55,Grandfather:,"Now that I have another mouth to feed I had to return to the mill. Where is my truss?
"
5,9,56,Lily:,"You not only prevented them from moving to Florida but you obliged to rework grandfather?
"
5,9,57,Mickey:,"Just the time to share my games with my Aldrin limitless SENSAS last game ', ""Fighting dogs"".
"
5,9,58,Ted (2030):,"And Lily threw a glance at her father that Marshall had seen only a few times. A look that we all pray not to receive, his eyes ""You're dead to me.""
"
5,9,59,Ted (2030):,"Which brings us back to Thanksgiving 2009.
"
5,9,60,Mickey:,"I brought ""The Disease""!
"
5,9,61,Lily:,"What is he doing here?
"
5,9,62,Marshall:,"I do not know but we should bring him in and discover.
"
5,9,63,Lily:,"I want to see him! Returns it!
"
5,9,64,Marshall:,"Stay there, okay? We will solve the problem.
"
5,9,65,Mickey:,"Take your time, amigo. All is well as I ""Of Diseases""!Having fun is contagious.
"
5,9,66,Robin:,"I hope Lily is well.
"
5,9,67,Ted:,"Me too. She speaks little, but that thing with his father gave him much trouble.
"
5,9,68,Barney:,"Tell me which of you is going to slap me!
"
5,9,69,Ted:,"What?
"
5,9,70,Barney:,"I die, I, here. Ted takes a chip, I jump! Robin arranges her hair, I jump! I jump all the time. It's bad for my skin. It gives me wrinkles. Wrinkles!
"
5,9,71,Marshall:,"Lily, go. It's been 3 years. This is long enough.
"
5,9,72,Lily:,"The equity in my life brings me nothing but stress. It's easier that he is dead to me.
"
5,9,73,Marshall:,"I've supported when our neighbor, Mr. Sias, died in your sight.
"
5,9,74,Lily:,"This is our journal.
"
5,9,75,Neighbor:,"You will have it in 15 minutes. 20 or more. I ate a steak last night.
"
5,9,76,Marshall:,"And when Whitney, your maid of honor, had died in your sight.
"
5,9,77,Robin:,"You're worth it!
"
5,9,78,Female:,"The color is gorgeous!
"
5,9,79,Lily:,"Thank you, girls.
"
5,9,80,Whitney:,"I'm not a fan of strapless.
"
5,9,81,Marshall:,"I even understood when Mr. Park to the grocery store downstairs was dead in your eyes.
"
5,9,82,Lily:,"A coffee, please. But only if it is decaf. I want to sleep tonight.
"
5,9,83,Grocer:,"$ 1.50.
"
5,9,84,Man:,"Coffee normal.
"
5,9,85,Grocer:,"$ 1.50.
"
5,9,86,Lily:,"I'm sorry. Are you sure mine is decaf? You used the same coffee.
"
5,9,87,Grocer:,"I lied to him to him. Okay?
"
5,9,88,Lily:,"OK (She leaves the grocery store, coffee in hand. In his bed while sleeping Marshall)... You dirty b*st*rd! (It returns in pajamas to the grocery store) It was not decaf!
"
5,9,89,Marshall:,"I've supported with these unknowns, but it's your father, okay? We can at least give him some turkey?
"
5,9,90,Lily:,"No.
"
5,9,91,Marshall:,"Go. Please, I can not ask him to leave at Thanksgiving.
"
5,9,92,Lily:,"You did not ask. Tell him it's just important that it is here. In less than two, it will be a games convention in Toledo, to give money to your dental apparatus in a so-called Milton Bradley.
"
5,9,93,Marshall:,"He was trying to earn money to feed his family.
"
5,9,94,Lily:,"No, that's what mom was doing with his two jobs. This man broke my heart every day for 20 years.
"
5,9,95,Marshall:,"So we can give pieces of chicken not cooked.
"
5,9,96,Ted:,"Seriously Robin, you should have the slap. You're a big baffeuse. In fact, I want to study the slaps in your tutoring. I wanna be your apprentice-slap.
"
5,9,97,Robin:,"Do not underestimate. You're a rock star of slaps. Your name should be Eric Baffe-PTON.
"
5,9,98,Barney:,"This is torture. Put me in the chair...
"
5,9,99,Ted:,"The Throne of Baffe.
"
5,9,100,Barney:,"And finish it!
"
5,9,101,Robin:,"It's all yours.
"
5,9,102,Ted:,"No. To you, I insist.
"
5,9,103,Robin:,"Okay, I will.
"
5,9,104,Ted:,"Great. Wait, what?
"
5,9,105,Robin:,"I say I'll slap.
"
5,9,106,Ted:,"What, so it's... the end of the discussion?
"
5,9,107,Robin:,"You said I could slap.
"
5,9,108,Ted:,"I was polite. If someone will slap, it will be me.
"
5,9,109,Robin:,"No, not at all.
"
5,9,110,Barney:,"This is interesting.
"
5,9,111,Marshall:,"It's your family. And I'm sorry but we do not separate the family.
"
5,9,112,Lily:,"It's easy for you to say that, you come to the family the most ridiculously close to the world.
"
5,9,113,Marshall:,"It is not ridiculously close.
"
5,9,114,Lily:,"Really? And the Eriksen family dinner every Sunday?
"
5,9,115,Father:,"Everything looks delicious, mom Eriksen.
"
5,9,116,Mother:,"Thank you, daddy bear. Marshall, will you say grace?
"
5,9,117,"Marshall, in video on the computer:","Well, I would be happy, Mom. Everyone, please, give your hands. Dear Lord...
"
5,9,118,Lily:,"I'm sorry but it's weird.
"
5,9,119,Marshall:,"A family must be close like that. And I want our future family is. And that includes your father.
"
5,9,120,Lily:,"I can not believe you take her part. Let me be clear. This man will never set foot in this house, ever!
"
5,9,121,Marshall:,"It will take about 5 minutes.
"
5,9,122,"Mickey, sitting on the floor:","I hope it's soon. I lose the war against hemorrhoids.
"
5,9,123,Marshall:,"It's a disease?
"
5,9,124,Mickey:,"No.
"
5,9,125,Robin:,"We have one hour before sunset, and none of us baffera Barney.
"
5,9,126,Ted:,"Let me do it. It was my idea to call the objects found in the prefecture.
"
5,9,127,Barney:,"It's a good point. Rebuttal?
"
5,9,128,Robin:,"I slipped a note of the type 20!
"
5,9,129,Barney:,"philosophical riddle. Idea against execution. Itemize your arguments.
"
5,9,130,Ted:,"I brought this large turkey so far.
"
5,9,131,Robin:,"I paid the taxi.
"
5,9,132,Ted:,"You've slept with one of my best friends!
"
5,9,133,Robin:,"What? You said it was fine.
"
5,9,134,Ted:,"Well, no!
"
5,9,135,Robin:,"Why did not you say anything?
"
5,9,136,Ted:,"Because I love you always!
"
5,9,137,Robin:,"You really want to slap Barney the point of lying and pretending to be in love with me?
"
5,9,138,Ted:,"I really want to slap!
"
5,9,139,Marshall:,"Your father has made mistakes in the past, but it has changed. He moved out of your grandparents. He has a job. He pays his taxes.
"
5,9,140,Lily:,"Wait, how you know all this?
"
5,9,141,Marshall:,"Gender, body language. Okay, we had a drink last week.
"
5,9,142,Mickey:,"I miss her so much. My little princess. She talks about me?
"
5,9,143,Marshall:,"Yeah, kind, all the time. She tells this story all the time...
"
5,9,144,Mickey:,"Never?
"
5,9,145,Marshall:,"No, not a word. But that does not have to be like that.We can fix that, right?
"
5,9,146,Mickey:,"I always thought it would arrange the marriage. I even wrote a speech. But hey, not invited '. Thin, I have not even seen the wedding photo.
"
5,9,147,Marshall:,"And right before my eyes, your father broke down in tears. (Actually, it's Marshall who starts crying) Stop it! You come to Thanksgiving!
"
5,9,148,Lily:,"You've invited?!
"
5,9,149,Marshall:,"The poor man was sobbing. What could I do? A fool and called him a girl, what I found unjustified.
"
5,9,150,Lily:,"I do not believe you. What gives you the right to do that?
"
5,9,151,Marshall:,"You and I are married. So it is also part of my family.(Marshall will open the door for the third time) Enter.
"
5,9,152,Mickey:,"Ted, you should play quickly. Your gallbladder is about to explode.
"
5,9,153,Marshall:,"It must be half an hour. We should get Lily.
"
5,9,154,Mickey:,"You have to let it calm down. Finish the game.
"
5,9,155,Barney:,"Repeat-a. The first seven!
"
5,9,156,Ted:,"Robin sh1t! I knew Barney first. This is for me to slap.
"
5,9,157,Robin:,"This slap is mine, Mosby. I never slap Barney... above the belt.
"
5,9,158,Ted:,"I want to slap Barney since I met him!
"
5,9,159,Robin:,"And I would not slap?
"
5,9,160,Ted:,"One second. This slap was supposed to be a wonderful thing, a gift, and it has turned against each other.
"
5,9,161,Robin:,"My God, you're right. This fruit has changed in immaculate slap-poisoned apple. You know what? Seriously, do it.
"
5,9,162,Ted:,"Are you sure?
"
5,9,163,Robin:,"Baffe-solument.
"
5,9,164,Marshall:,"We should really get Lily.
"
5,9,165,Mickey:,"Ted, gall bladder about to fart.
"
5,9,166,Ted:,"It's decided. Barney, go. Come on the throne.
"
5,9,167,Barney:,"You're gonna...
"
5,9,168,Ted:,"Yep. Go.
"
5,9,169,Barney:,"I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women.
"
5,9,170,Ted:,"Do not listen. It's decided.
"
5,9,171,Barney:,"And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps.
"
5,9,172,Robin:,"Leads to me!
"
5,9,173,Ted:,"Robin! Pull yourself together! (The timer sounds and ""something sprung from the game) What just happened?
"
5,9,174,Mickey:,"Sorry, Ted. Explosion of the gallbladder. You stand back 3 spaces.
"
5,9,175,Marshall:,"You come here and you watch your daughter go without care. And now you destroy the Thanksgiving dinner! Lily is on it since this morning!
"
5,9,176,Mickey:,"Relax. This is not true of bile. It is of Chinese painting to lead. And bile horse.
"
5,9,177,Ted (2030):,"And at that time, Marshall is launching a look at Mickey none of us had ever seen.
"
5,9,178,Mickey:,"What is it? It does what?
"
5,9,179,Ted:,"You have swallowed this painting?
"
5,9,180,Marshall:,"This is my look ""you're dead to me.""
"
5,9,181,Mickey:,"Yeah, Lily does it better...
"
5,9,182,Marshall:,"Get out of my house!
"
5,9,183,Marshall:,"In Mr. Park... I was not expecting to find you here. Lily, I'm sorry. Just let me express myself. I thought the family was right but it's wrong. It is a privilege, and it deserves it. I put your father out. And I promise you, baby, I do... you never force her to see him again. (Lily starts to cry) What? Baby, what has happened?
"
5,9,184,Lily:,"Marshall, I came here because I was cold and it was the only place that was open. I would not even look at Mr. Park in the eye. And then I discovered that... Mr. Park's death. He really died for me. And if I feel so bad to have never forgiven Mr. Park, a guy who literally did not mean anything to me? We have to get my father.
"
5,9,185,Ted (2030):,"And that's the way to Thanksgiving 2009, your aunt Lily was a miracle. (Lily and Marshall arrive at the door of their apartment, when Mickey's father, Lily, was released. She throws herself into his arms) It has brought a man to life.
"
5,9,186,"Marshall, tapping on a glass:","Everyone. Before we begin, Barney, we'll need you on the throne of Baffe.
"
5,9,187,Barney:,"Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation...
"
5,9,188,Lily:,"Less talking shop, more slaps.
"
5,9,189,Marshall:,"You just 2 minutes. You decided which of you will be entitled to a slap in the face to Barney?
"
5,9,190,Robin:,"It's gonna be Ted.
"
5,9,191,Ted:,"What? Why me?
"
5,9,192,Robin:,"Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can.
"
5,9,193,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
5,9,194,Barney:,"This is the worst.
"
5,9,195,Ted:,"You just go through a break... and even though I know that you and Barney are remained on good terms, there is not a part of you, well hidden that wants to slap in the face?
"
5,9,196,Robin:,"Yes
"
5,9,197,Ted:,"I know.
"
5,9,198,Barney:,"It's downright hell.
"
5,9,199,Ted:,"Okay.
"
5,9,200,Barney:,"It hurts!
"
5,9,201,Robin:,"I can not do it. I can not take that away from you, Ted.
"
5,9,202,Ted:,"I do not either.
"
5,9,203,Barney:,"thank you God.
"
5,9,204,Robin:,"So, I want to move. Mickey?
"
5,9,205,Barney:,"No way!
"
5,9,206,Robin:,"I'm glad you and Lily try to fix things. You want to welcome into our family, I would like to offer you the slap.
"
5,9,207,Mickey:,"Really? It's a bit weird for me, I just met Barney and I have nothing against him but how many times have we a chance to slap someone in the face?
"
5,9,208,Barney:,"Gently!
"
5,9,209,Mickey:,"I'm sorry. I can not do it.
"
5,9,210,Barney:,"thank you God.
"
5,9,211,Mickey:,"I know I have not been a good father.
"
5,9,212,Barney:,"You're kidding me.
"
5,9,213,Mickey:,"So for all dance recitals that I missed, for all the art exhibitions that I should attend... for the wedding that I was not able to offer you... I give you, to you This slap.
"
5,9,214,Barney:,"No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!
"
5,9,215,Lily:,"The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.
"
5,9,216,Barney:,"It's not good. Please... Let me...
"
5,9,217,Lily:,"Close your eyes. It will soon be over.
"
5,9,218,Barney:,"I'm running in a meadow.
"
5,9,219,Lily:,"I can not do it. Why I can not do it?
"
5,9,220,Marshall:,"Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.
"
5,9,221,Barney:,"Stop your bullshit.
"
5,9,222,Marshall:,"And so... there will not slap... of... today.
"
5,9,223,Barney:,"This is the best Thanksgiving...
"
5,9,224,Marshall:,"4! So the turkey?
"
5,9,225,Voices:,"A new home Aldrin Games, is... The Bet-Baffe! The game of happy slaps which is a box. (Children are playing, and a little boy slap a girl, then they laugh) You got slap. Right in the face, my friend... For children of all ages. You got slap. It really happened... Everyone saw! Everyone laughed and applauded because it was great...
"
5,9,226,Boy:,"I won!
"
5,9,227,Voice:,".. The way you got yourself slap. Baffez you like crazy with the Pari-Baffe, Aldrin in a carton. No child was slap while filming the ad.
"
5,21,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, your Aunt Robin was dating Don until recently, but one evening, coming from nowhere...
"
5,21,2,Don:,"You want to install?
"
5,21,3,Robin:,"Well... it's a bit early... but... of course, I might consider... I moved here, let me think.
"
5,21,4,Don:,"I mean, you can install yourself beyond me to sit?
"
5,21,5,Robin:,"Yeah, that's what I was talking about me too. As I said, let me think. I agree.
"
5,21,6,Don:,"But... now that you've mentioned... you wanna install?
"
5,21,7,Lily:,"You said what?
"
5,21,8,Robin:,"I thought about it.
"
5,21,9,Barney:,"You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless.
"
5,21,10,Robin:,"We have the same job, Barney.
"
5,21,11,Barney:,"And we could not be more proud of you, my angel.
"
5,21,12,Lily:,"It still seems fast.
"
5,21,13,Robin:,"You're probably right.
"
5,21,14,Ted:,"You should live with him.
"
5,21,15,Robin:,"Really?
"
5,21,16,Ted:,"Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you.
"
5,21,17,Robin:,"You wanna throw me out because of something with milk?
"
5,21,18,Ted:,"It's super boring.
"
5,21,19,Ted:,"Robin?!
"
5,21,20,Robin:,"No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.
"
5,21,21,Ted:,"Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?
"
5,21,22,Barney:,"All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.
"
5,21,23,Robin:,"Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.
"
5,21,24,Barney:,"I promise.
"
5,21,25,Barney:,"I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?
"
5,21,26,Don:,"It's good.
"
5,21,27,Robin:,"And it was Barney.
"
5,21,28,Don:,"It's not bad.
"
5,21,29,Ted:,"Actually, I'm not sure.
"
5,21,30,Don:,"I think it's great. But I pity any woman with self-esteem so low it would go out with him.
"
5,21,31,Ted (2030):,"Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.
"
5,21,32,Barney:,"I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.
"
5,21,33,Ted (2030):,"There, he knew it.
"
5,21,34,Don:,"So Barney's your ex and you hang out with him? It makes me uncomfortable.
"
5,21,35,Robin:,"The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.
"
5,21,36,Barney:,"In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin.
"
5,21,37,Robin:,"How was your weekend, or any other topic?
"
5,21,38,Lily:,"Atrocious.
"
5,21,39,Marshall:,"Terrible.
"
5,21,40,Lily:,"Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain.
"
5,21,41,Marshall:,"Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room.
"
5,21,42,Lily:,"Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second......
"
5,21,43,Voice:,"Maid!
"
5,21,44,Marshall:,"You can come back later? It takes a nap.
"
5,21,45,Voice:,"It's time to return the keys.
"
5,21,46,Marshall:,"We spent 18 hours.
"
5,21,47,Lily:,"We missed the full board.
"
5,21,48,Marshall:,"I lost 5 kg.
"
5,21,49,Don:,"It's not weird that Robin is still friends with Barney?
"
5,21,50,Ted:,"It's odd that we all still be friends with Barney.
"
5,21,51,Don:,"I do not know how to react to the fact that she hangs out with an ex.
"
5,21,52,Ted (2030):,"Robin had said nothing either to Don about another of his ex. Me.
"
5,21,53,Ted:,"Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. sh1t, two is even better. Because strawberry...
"
5,21,54,Don:,"But if you had someone and he hung out with an ex...
"
5,21,55,Ted:,"Wait, sorry. ""It? ""
"
5,21,56,Don:,"He was friends with his ex.
"
5,21,57,Ted:,"Wait, wait. You think I'm gay? Why you would assume that?
"
5,21,58,Robin:,"Your teacher of calligraphy called...
"
5,21,59,Ted:,"And?
"
5,21,60,Robin:,"Your ink arrived.
"
5,21,61,Ted:,"Yes.
"
5,21,62,"Ted, leaving her room:","I wanted to ensure that Project Runway is registering. The uniform changed to the Jets?
"
5,21,63,"Ted, an apron:","I think there will be no creme brulee tonight. My torch to brown is broken.
"
5,21,64,Don:,"When I found out that your roommate is single, I was a little jealous, but now that I know he's gay, so good.
"
5,21,65,Robin:,"Ted is not...
"
5,21,66,Ted:,"But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs.
"
5,21,67,Don:,"Thank you. Ted is not it?
"
5,21,68,Robin:,"Ted will not be much there. It follows Cher's tour.
"
5,21,69,Ted:,"Think again, Cher made some great concerts. But I'm not gay.
"
5,21,70,Don:,"Lily, be honest. It's not weird that Robin train with an ex?
"
5,21,71,Lily:,"Ted and Robin broke up there for years. This is not a problem.
"
5,21,72,Don:,"Ted? And Robin?
"
5,21,73,Ted:,"I'm so gay, eh, Donnie?
"
5,21,74,Bartender:,"An apple martini for gentleman.
"
5,21,75,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
5,21,76,Don:,"You're also out with Ted? 4 people you consider your best friends, you've slept with 50% of them.
"
5,21,77,Robin:,"It's just my friends.
"
5,21,78,Don:,"But they are also your ex. And you live with one of them.I'm sorry. I have to think about all that.
"
5,21,79,"Lily, thinking:","Her toenails are daggers.
"
5,21,80,"Lily, thinking:","Great! And now he falls asleep. Hello, river of slime.
"
5,21,81,"Marshall, thinking:","My knee itches. I'll just scratch a little.
"
5,21,82,Lily:,"It should have separate beds.
"
5,21,83,Marshall:,"Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds.
"
5,21,84,Lily:,"a deal!
"
5,21,85,Don:,"I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.
"
5,21,86,Barney:,"Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.
"
5,21,87,Don:,"Not at all.
"
5,21,88,Barney:,"That was after you to be part.
"
5,21,89,Robin:,"Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning.
"
5,21,90,Don:,"I acts as a hysteric. It's not offensive, right?
"
5,21,91,Ted:,"Still not gay.
"
5,21,92,Don:,"Sorry, I meant you're both important to Robin. How about dinner tomorrow night at home.
"
5,21,93,Ted:,"It's great.
"
5,21,94,Barney:,"I can not wait, buddy.
"
5,21,95,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
5,21,96,Don:,"You're welcome.
"
5,21,97,Robin:,"So long, guys.
"
5,21,98,Barney:,"I have to get Robin.
"
5,21,99,Ted:,"Are you kidding?
"
5,21,100,Barney:,"I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin.
"
5,21,101,Ted:,"I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.
"
5,21,102,Barney:,"I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while.
"
5,21,103,Ted:,"You ready.
"
5,21,104,Barney:,"Ready for what?
"
5,21,105,Ted:,"To read the letter.
"
5,21,106,Ted (2030):,"Children, I invented the letter to remind me of the reasons for a breakup. I did it for years.
"
5,21,107,Ted:,"Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now.
"
5,21,108,Ted:,"Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who beat you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited.
"
5,21,109,Ted:,"Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy.
"
5,21,110,Ted (2030):,"When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before...
"
5,21,111,Barney:,"Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake.
"
5,21,112,Ted:,"Write it.
"
5,21,113,Barney:,"What?
"
5,21,114,Ted:,"Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.
"
5,21,115,Barney:,"My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool.
"
5,21,116,Ted:,"Right?
"
5,21,117,Barney:,"You... and Robin...
"
5,21,118,Barney:,".. a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts.
"
5,21,119,Ted:,"Get it?
"
5,21,120,Barney:,"I understand. I really want it back.
"
5,21,121,Marshall:,"Humans are not made to share a bed. s*x and sleep are associated, but these are two different things.
"
5,21,122,Lily:,"I know. I love you, but I want this new bed is a sanctuary of my sleep and my sleep only.
"
5,21,123,Marshall:,"Me too. And snacks, but that's all. You know what we should do? Buy a third bed to make love.
"
5,21,124,Lily:,"A bed for s*x. For hot s*x and bestiality.
"
5,21,125,Marshall:,"Awesome. That way, each bed will have its uses.
"
5,21,126,Lily:,"Right. There will be two beds for sleeping, one for s*x, and I thought an ottoman for birthdays.
"
5,21,127,Marshall:,"Baby, you come to revolutionize modern marriage?
"
5,21,128,Lily:,"And how.
"
5,21,129,Don:,"Do you like sushi?
"
5,21,130,Robin:,"Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.
"
5,21,131,Barney:,"It's too easy.
"
5,21,132,Ted:,"Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying ""Sit wherever you want, except on that chair."" You will be so...
"
5,21,133,Barney:,"My chair!
"
5,21,134,Lily:,"From spicy tuna? My favorite.
"
5,21,135,Don:,"I do too. It is more spicy, the better.
"
5,21,136,Barney:,"Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad.
"
5,21,137,Marshall:,"You will not believe. Don also has twin beds.
"
5,21,138,Lily:,"We just had.
"
5,21,139,Don:,"Great. Super.
"
5,21,140,Lily:,"Wait. This ""super"" does not look great.
"
5,21,141,Don:,"My ex and I thought it would be a good idea but they separated.
"
5,21,142,Marshall:,"But I bet you have no special bed s*x.
"
5,21,143,Don:,"It yes, with his personal trainer.
"
5,21,144,Barney:,"This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth.
"
5,21,145,Don:,"But if Robin decides to move, I bought a giant bed.
"
5,21,146,Robin:,"I would love. If I move.
"
5,21,147,Don:,"If you moved in.
"
5,21,148,Barney:,"Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!
"
5,21,149,Ted:,"Great! Give her milk!
"
5,21,150,Robin:,"spit, spit!
"
5,21,151,Don:,"We have more milk. Thank you for the reminder, Robin.
"
5,21,152,Ted:,"Well, I hope you're happy.
"
5,21,153,Barney:,"I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.
"
5,21,154,Ted:,"You were emptied from the top and bottom.
"
5,21,155,Barney:,"Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.
"
5,21,156,Ted:,"Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.
"
5,21,157,Barney:,"You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it.
"
5,21,158,Ted:,"That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.
"
5,21,159,Barney:,"For my biographer?
"
5,21,160,Ted:,"Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And sh1t. I want it back.
"
5,21,161,Ted (2030):,"So that night, with Barney, we sat down to talk calmly and reasonably to the most deserving Robin.
"
5,21,162,Ted:,"I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.
"
5,21,163,Barney:,".. I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!
"
5,21,164,Ted:,"It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.
"
5,21,165,Barney:,"Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically.
"
5,21,166,Ted:,"Of course.
"
5,21,167,Barney:,"Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!
"
5,21,168,Ted:,"We all talk!
"
5,21,169,Lily:,"I'm worried. I do not want that divorce.
"
5,21,170,Marshall:,"This is Don. It's not us. Our new way to sleep is only going to get closer. Now, get out of my bed.
"
5,21,171,Lily:,"We can at least get closer?
"
5,21,172,Marshall:,"Sure. You spoke of the beds. No, I'm not.
"
5,21,173,Lily:,"Why?
"
5,21,174,Marshall:,"I love you more than anything, but you're worse than a kettle. I'm surprised that your pee breaks are not as steam.
"
5,21,175,Lily:,"You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you.
"
5,21,176,Marshall:,"To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess.
"
5,21,177,Lily:,"We're getting closer?
"
5,21,178,Marshall:,"You speak of beds yet?
"
5,21,179,Lily:,"Nope.
"
5,21,180,Marshall:,"Come here.
"
5,21,181,Barney:,"Robin Stinson!
"
5,21,182,Ted:,"Robin Mosby!
"
5,21,183,Barney:,"Robin Stinson!
"
5,21,184,Ted:,"Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.
"
5,21,185,Barney:,"Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it.
"
5,21,186,Ted:,"Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.
"
5,21,187,Barney:,"You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break...
"
5,21,188,Barney:,"It's BarnExclussif.
"
5,21,189,Robin:,"BarnExclussif, not quit. I have a double appeal.
"
5,21,190,Ted:,"It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey?
"
5,21,191,Robin:,"No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.
"
5,21,192,Barney:,"Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem.
"
5,21,193,Robin:,"What's the matter?
"
5,21,194,Ted:,"There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back.
"
5,21,195,Ted:,"We almost lose control.
"
5,21,196,Barney:,"It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.
"
5,21,197,Barney:,"Robin, I love you!
"
5,21,198,Ted:,"Species of b*st*rd! I brought the blue French horn!
"
5,21,199,Barney:,"I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you.
"
5,21,200,"Robin, at the window:","Guys, what do you do?
"
5,21,201,Ted:,"I want you back!
"
5,21,202,Don:,"Come on, get.
"
5,21,203,Barney:,"All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!
"
5,21,204,Ted:,"Something to three.
"
5,21,205,Don:,"Robin and I have to go to work. Sit down watching TV and will be discussed when we come back, okay?
"
5,21,206,Ted:,"You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!
"
5,21,207,Barney:,"We won the fingers in the nose...
"
5,21,208,Ted:,"Where's this great TV?
"
5,21,209,Don:,"Right there.
"
5,21,210,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
5,21,211,Don:,"You're welcome. Good night, guys.
"
5,21,212,Barney:,"Good night, Dad.
"
5,21,213,Marshall:,"It was good. Well, you gotta go.
"
5,21,214,Lily:,"What?
"
5,21,215,Marshall:,"I'm sorry. It was great and you're great. But, I must get up early, so...
"
5,21,216,Lily:,"You throw me like that?
"
5,21,217,Marshall:,"You knew before you start. (Lily gets up to join his bed) Wait. Forget your sweater. Nice try.
"
5,21,218,Robin:,"The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.
"
5,21,219,Barney:,"Dad?
"
5,21,220,Robin:,"We get up, fuckers. You remember last night?
"
5,21,221,Barney:,"Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing...
"
5,21,222,Ted:,"I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group.
"
5,21,223,Robin:,"Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don.
"
5,21,224,Barney:,"So what's going on with Robin?
"
5,21,225,Ted:,"You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of sh1t.
"
5,21,226,Barney:,"I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past.
"
5,21,227,Ted:,"Let me see!
"
5,21,228,Barney:,"Give me that.
"
5,21,229,Ted:,"Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.
"
5,21,230,Barney:,"In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?
"
5,21,231,Ted:,"Too great.
"
5,21,232,Ted:,"Robin?!
"
5,23,1,Ted (2030):,"Kids, when you are 20, going out with someone that's great, but reached 30 years, we realize that everyone has baggage. Of course, you can choose to ignore it, but sooner or later...
"
5,23,2,Woman:,"That's my ex, sorry. We try to remain friends. Hello, my chick! You have tickets to Maui?
"
5,23,3,Ted (2030):,"That spring, I began to see Royce. She was beautiful, intelligent...
"
5,23,4,Ted:,"Anyway... We were happy together.
"
5,23,5,Lily:,"What...
"
5,23,6,Ted:,"That's it. This is the problem.
"
5,23,7,Barney:,"Her ass?
"
5,23,8,Marshall:,"Big?
"
5,23,9,Lily:,"Small?
"
5,23,10,Robin:,"This is an access problem?
"
5,23,11,Ted:,"There will always be a bag. Even if it goes well, it ends one day by spoiling.
"
5,23,12,Barney:,"Once in 30 years.
"
5,23,13,Ted:,"When I discover his luggage. I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over.
"
5,23,14,Barney:,"Please, tell me you repliest not emotional baggage.
"
5,23,15,Ted:,"It's a good thing?
"
5,23,16,Barney:,"The emotional baggage is the foundation of American cultural export the most important.
"
5,23,17,All:,"The p0rn.
"
5,23,18,Barney:,"Actually, the p0rn. Only women with major baggage make p0rn.
"
5,23,19,Ted and Robin:,"Major Baggage.
"
5,23,20,Robin:,"Everyone has one. You should know the face.
"
5,23,21,Ted:,"Really? The last time I overcame a background, it was that of a certain Stella, and, damn, I draw a blank. How did it end?
"
5,23,22,Ted (2030):,"This is how. I gave him my request, she said yes.We were happy. And I's wedding day, her ex, karate teacher, Tony Grafanello, showed up, he declared his love, Stella and fled with him, leaving me there, my heart completely broken.
"
5,23,23,Lily:,"What happened is horrible, it does not mean that is the case for everyone.
"
5,23,24,Marshall:,"Content that will be encountered young, not to be.
"
5,23,25,Lily:,"Issues mother.
"
5,23,26,Marshall:,"Not at all.
"
5,23,27,Ted:,"From grandmother.
"
5,23,28,Marshall:,"Certainly not.
"
5,23,29,Barney:,"On the great grandmother.
"
5,23,30,Marshall:,"I do not like it myself cuddly.
"
5,23,31,Robin:,"And you know your worst baggage? You're too nice.
"
5,23,32,Marshall:,"It's not a nice bag?
"
5,23,33,Robin:,"You've already looked walking down the street?
"
5,23,34,Marshall:,"I know not what to answer.
"
5,23,35,Robin:,"I'll help.
"
5,23,36,Marshall:,"I'll help you. (It helps a man to repair his bike) That should do it. Guys, not today. It would be... (He begins to dance)
"
5,23,37,Marshall:,"It's normal.
"
5,23,38,Barney:,"There is a street where it's normal. One clue: a giant yellow bird lives on.
"
5,23,39,Ted:,"I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice.
"
5,23,40,Barney:,"Gentile? This is the worst baggage. The best: she hates her father, and she believes to be big, but no. Steamy s*x at first date, and have brekky, she left. Why are you with me?
"
5,23,41,Ted (2030):,"That night, with Royce, I waited to see what would be his luggage.
"
5,23,42,Royce:,"Spaghetti is your specialty?
"
5,23,43,Ted:,"It does not beat my pancakes. I'll make once. There are incredible.
"
5,23,44,Royce:,"My father made me pancakes complete... Thanks to him, I worked in p0rn. You know? ""Parents Offering Recognition, Nutrition and Order""? A charity for teens who do not have access to sport or healthy food. Reminds me... I killed my brother... with this joke last night. A barber, a stripper and a pediatric psychiatrist..., walk into a bar.
"
5,23,45,Ted (2030):,"I searched and searched, but apparently there was no luggage so I had to worry about, until we go see a movie.
"
5,23,46,Robin:,"What took you so, one time!
"
5,23,47,Marshall:,"It's nothing. Forget.
"
5,23,48,Lily:,"It was on his way and Marshall wanted to stop to help guys to load their van.
"
5,23,49,Marshall:,"To be nice. It cost nothing.
"
5,23,50,Lily:,"And when the van is gone, which shows up if it is not the owner of the apartment, which had just been robbed help. And that was hard to explain to the police.
"
5,23,51,Robin:,"That's what I meant. New York is not a small town, friendly, crime-free, inbred, in the woods, with cows lost in Minnesota, where you've grown.
"
5,23,52,Marshall:,"No crime? In 1994, the cashier of the grocery store was robbed. Besides, I like being friendly, okay? I will change not it.
"
5,23,53,Lily:,"Do not change, baby. I find it pure. Pure. (Marshall gets up to the counter) Mashed mother of God is a moron sometimes. He lent them money to refuel.
"
5,23,54,Robin:,"He gave them money?
"
5,23,55,Lily:,"Not given, lent. They said they would send a check, so Marshall gave our address. What prevents them from coming home one night, and maybe tie me? With Marshall, sometimes we pretend for real but it's terrifying.
"
5,23,56,Robin:,"Why would you tell her anything?
"
5,23,57,Lily:,"What interest? He's from Minnesota. The mascot of his high school, it was a hug. Marshall is back with a beer while Ted joined them in turn.
"
5,23,58,Robin:,"What was with Royce?
"
5,23,59,Ted:,"Interesting. We went to this new film The Future Bride.
"
5,23,60,Marshall:,"Was it good?! Not that I'm interested. This is for girls.But it could take me there, like, 7:10 p.m. at the session tomorrow, 9:40 p.m. where because of my meeting. But I will leave soon, we will try to 7:10 p.m..
"
5,23,61,Robin:,"What's the movie about, anyway?
"
5,23,62,Ted:,"This is where it's interesting.
"
5,23,63,Man:,"Big sucks, I'm Jed Mosley! I am the architect's most powerful and corrupt New York. I want... (He spills his coffee) It's gonna leave a job!
"
5,23,64,Ted:,"It's about me.
"
5,23,65,Lily:,"The Future Bride talking about you?
"
5,23,66,Marshall:,"You sure it's you? When I saw The Wild History of space, I would have sworn...
"
5,23,67,Ted:,"This is my story. It is written by Tony Grafanello.
"
5,23,68,Robin:,"Tony Grafanello? This is...
"
5,23,69,Ted:,"With him that Stella is gone. This film tells the story of our breakup.
"
5,23,70,Robin:,"Why would he make a film? It's not him, the villain?
"
5,23,71,Lily:,"Yes, nice and called Ted Mosby.
"
5,23,72,Ted:,"It's funny, it's also my recollection. But according to the film...
"
5,23,73,Voices:,"Mr. Mosley, your fiancee is here.
"
5,23,74,Jed Mosley:,"Great, the ball and chain. I look forward to her moving from her home in New Jersey to live in an apartment above a bar. It falls! What do I owe this pleasure?
"
5,23,75,Stella:,"We had to go taste the wedding cakes, remember?
"
5,23,76,Jed:,"Bluntly not, doll.
"
5,23,77,Marshall:,"I'm stunned.
"
5,23,78,Ted:,"Right?
"
5,23,79,Marshall:,"That's comedies these days? I fall off my chair! I really fell off my chair. It was funny.
"
5,23,80,Robin:,"What idiot. He chose a beautiful girl for my role?
"
5,23,81,Ted:,"You're not in it.
"
5,23,82,Robin:,"What a jerk!
"
5,23,83,Ted:,"No, Tony is not stupid. Well, not after the movie.
"
5,23,84,Stella:,"I'm getting married. Sorry, Tony.
"
5,23,85,Tony:,"Stella, your happiness is all that matters to me, except his poor children I care volunteer.
"
5,23,86,Royce:,"I love it.
"
5,23,87,Stella:,"It's not so easy. Jed Mosley is perhaps not as beautiful as you, or as big...
"
5,23,88,Ted:,"I'm bigger than him.
"
5,23,89,Stella:,"And s*x is horrible. Once he fell asleep in the middle.
"
5,23,90,Ted:,"Once. I was on medication!
"
5,23,91,Royce:,"What?
"
5,23,92,Ted:,"Nothing.
"
5,23,93,Ted:,"This movie is really rotten! And everything is wrong!Remember my request? This spontaneous moment in the game room, I had no ring, so I gave him a teddy?
"
5,23,94,Lily:,"It was cute.
"
5,23,95,Marshall:,"And romantic.
"
5,23,96,Robin:,"A little cutesy.
"
5,23,97,Ted:,"That's how it was in the movie...
"
5,23,98,Jed:,"If it makes you shut up, I think we can get married.
"
5,23,99,Stella:,"You do not give me the ring?
"
5,23,100,Jed:,"Bluntly not, doll. You pass it the finger.
"
5,23,101,Ted:,"And the hot date 2 minutes? When I condensed a romantic rendezvous in 2 minutes to go with the busy schedule of Stella?
"
5,23,102,Lily:,"You're a good guy.
"
5,23,103,Marshall:,"It was really nice.
"
5,23,104,Robin:,"And a little cutesy.
"
5,23,105,Ted:,"According to the film...
"
5,23,106,Stella:,"And our romantic weekend?
"
5,23,107,Jed:,"Bluntly not, doll. Can I suggest a date of 2 minutes, if you know what I mean. Naked!
"
5,23,108,Marshall:,"If you know what you do, 2 minutes.
"
5,23,109,Lily:,"Word expert.
"
5,23,110,Ted:,"But the worst... the worst... it was the end. They are to marry...
"
5,23,111,Priest:,"Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley as legitimate spouses?
"
5,23,112,Marshall:,"Tell not the end! This is what I would say, if ever, I wanted to see a movie as bad. Continues.
"
5,23,113,Ted:,"So they are to marry...
"
5,23,114,Tony:,"Stella!
"
5,23,115,Stella:,"Tony!
"
5,23,116,Jed:,"Tony?
"
5,23,117,Tony:,"I must say something. Long ago, I left this beautiful daughter, Stella, to escape. And now she is with this jerk who does not appreciate the true value of this beautiful bride.
"
5,23,118,Ted:,"What is your problem?
"
5,23,119,Jed:,"You can not talk to me like that! I'm Ted Mosley!
"
5,23,120,Ted:,"He said ""Ted"", right?
"
5,23,121,Tony:,"Stella, I promised you'd be my wife. And I would keep that promise.
"
5,23,122,Stella:,"Everything I wanted in my life was your love.
"
5,23,123,Priest:,"Go ahead, darling, kiss him.
"
5,23,124,Tony:,"If you still love me... Would you be my bride?
"
5,23,125,Stella:,"Bluntly, doll.
"
5,23,126,Jed:,"Stop! Dad!
"
5,23,127,Children:,"Take that, Ted Mosby!
"
5,23,128,Ted:,"Okay, he really said this time around.
"
5,23,129,Royce:,"It was too much. I laugh, I cry. This is cinema, but it would not tell real people? It was so real! Why did you say ""Oh, no"" early in the film?
"
5,23,130,Ted (2030):,"This is where I realized that everyone has baggage, including me.
"
5,23,131,Ted:,"Nothing.
"
5,23,132,Lily:,"You must tell your story with Stella Royce. It will be released at one time or another.
"
5,23,133,Ted:,"Why? So why should it?
"
5,23,134,Robin:,"Because it is past the fifth most profitable films.
"
5,23,135,Ted:,"I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway!
"
5,23,136,Lily:,"He looks like zero.
"
5,23,137,Robin:,"I'll never see him out of friendship for you.
"
5,23,138,Ted (2030):,"Children, you see more.
"
5,23,139,Tony:,"She made her choice. Do not worry. I will not come to marriage.
"
5,23,140,Jed:,"You'll come! I'll take you there myself and force you to watch!
"
5,23,141,Tony:,"The code.
"
5,23,142,Barney:,"That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus.
"
5,23,143,Ted (2030):,"I was determined to make this film as far from me as possible. Unfortunately...
"
5,23,144,Royce:,"It was not great the bride?
"
5,23,145,Woman:,"I too loved it!
"
5,23,146,Man:,"We'll see tomorrow.
"
5,23,147,Royce:,"It may come? Want to see it again?
"
5,23,148,Ted:,"Yeah, that was good.
"
5,23,149,Royce:,"""Good""? Rather perfect! The only thing, and for me it is a very small defect, compared to other films, is that I understand why Stella wants to marry a guy like Jed Mosley. Just the name of this guy: Jed Mosley...
"
5,23,150,Woman:,"Royce, you're out with Jed Mosley, too.
"
5,23,151,Royce:,"Who has not? It is a sacred number. A butterfly tattoo, how to pronounce this encyclopedia.
"
5,23,152,Man and woman:,"""Encyclopaedie"".
"
5,23,153,Ted:,"Bluntly. Well, technically, this is the correct pronunciation.
"
5,23,154,Royce:,"I was so happy that this loser is done let go before the altar. You know why? Because he saw it coming. And the best part is that he will live a long, sad life, knowing he has lost his only chance of happiness. And when he gets beaten up by the goat?
"
5,23,155,Woman:,"Too funny!
"
5,23,156,Ted:,"Bluntly!
"
5,23,157,Royce:,"What a loser!
"
5,23,158,Ted:,"Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf Hitler, a new king has arrived!
"
5,23,159,Royce:,"Ted, you're okay?
"
5,23,160,Ted:,"I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love.
"
5,23,161,Royce:,"It was really bad, you should apologize.
"
5,23,162,Ted stood up:,"Bluntly not Carrément doll... not...
"
5,23,163,Lily:,"You said ""not altogether, doll?""
"
5,23,164,Marshall:,"You really used the phrase Jed Mosley?
"
5,23,165,Ted:,"I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence?
"
5,23,166,Marshall:,"I wanted to see Avatar.
"
5,23,167,Ted:,"It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride.
"
5,23,168,Robin:,"Good luck. This film is international, it's great.
"
5,23,169,Lily:,"Maybe North Korea?
"
5,23,170,Robin:,"I read that Kim Jong, he says it's his second favorite movie. Just after he made a film where the horse in slow motion.
"
5,23,171,Lily:,"Sorry, Ted, you're screwed.
"
5,23,172,Marshall:,"No, you know, Ted is not screwed. You know why I'm nice? Because I'm crazy baggage people. Most people see another person with this big suitcase, and they spend doing nothing. But not me. I look at them and say, ""Hi, stranger. Can I help you? ""And you know who taught me to be like that? A Ted Mosby. A decent and sincere guy who has faith. And you know what, Ted? Inside you, you're still that guy.
"
5,23,173,Ted:,"I still am.
"
5,23,174,Marshall:,"You wanna go get that girl.
"
5,23,175,Ted:,"I want to go get that girl.
"
5,23,176,Marshall:,"For it is the love of your life.
"
5,23,177,Ted:,"Because it is... Yeah, well... We had 3 rencards. It's nice.
"
5,23,178,Marshall:,"Because she's nice.
"
5,23,179,Ted:,"It's really nice! You're right, Marshall. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is.
"
5,23,180,Tony:,"The wedding is in 15 minutes. I'll never make it.
"
5,23,181,Child:,"You can do Sensei. Give a roundhouse kick to love. Live in the heart.
"
5,23,182,Tony:,"You're right. What am I doing? There is still time!
"
5,23,183,Priest:,"Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley as legitimate spouses?
"
5,23,184,Ted:,"Royce!
"
5,23,185,Royce:,"Ted?
"
5,23,186,Barney:,"Ted?
"
5,23,187,Ted:,"Barney?
"
5,23,188,Tony:,"I must say something.
"
5,23,189,Ted:,"I must say something. Long ago, I left that horrible daughter, Stella, break my heart. And now she is with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and this movie is called... The Future Bride.
"
5,23,190,Royce:,"What do you mean?
"
5,23,191,Jed:,"You can not talk to me like that!
"
5,23,192,Ted:,"I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.
"
5,23,193,Barney:,"To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?
"
5,23,194,Ted:,"What...
"
5,23,195,Barney:,"I wanted... People want to know.
"
5,23,196,Ted:,"They are burgundy in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.
"
5,23,197,Royce:,"All I wanted was some pancakes this week.
"
5,23,198,Barney:,"Come on, darling, kiss him.
"
5,23,199,Ted (2030):,"Barney did not say ""kiss"". Still not ""kiss"".
"
5,23,200,Man:,"You must go!
"
5,23,201,Barney:,"This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil!
"
5,23,202,Ted:,"Royce, if you...
"
5,23,203,Ted:,"Do I always appreciate... Would you like me to make pancakes?
"
5,23,204,Royce:,"Bluntly, doll.
"
5,23,205,Barney:,"Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.
"
5,23,206,Ted:,"That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered.
"
5,23,207,Royce:,"Let me help you.
"
5,23,208,Ted (2030):,"And like that, kids, my luggage no longer seemed so heavy. Everyone has his baggage, it's part of life. But like everything else, it's easier when someone helps us.
"
5,23,209,Ted:,"It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you.
"
5,23,210,Royce:,"It's not that important. Me too, I was let go before the altar. Three times. The last time, because I lost all our money at poker. That's why I live with my brother.
"
5,23,211,Ted:,"Wait, I thought you had a very small studio.
"
5,23,212,Royce:,"Just the two of us. You'll see, he still pulls the duvet.
"
5,23,213,Ted:,"Yeah, you need to go there.
"
5,22,1,Barney:,"Guess what I have behind my back.
"
5,22,2,Lily:,"Wait, wait. I will find. Left.
"
5,22,3,Barney:,"Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers.
"
5,22,4,Marshall:,"Robots vs. Wrestlers?
"
5,22,5,Ted:,"Great!
"
5,22,6,Barney:,"You know Robots vs. Wrestlers?
"
5,22,7,Marshall:,"No.
"
5,22,8,Ted:,"But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.
"
5,22,9,Barney:,"That's exactly it, according to the website!
"
5,22,10,Lily:,"Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?
"
5,22,11,Barney:,"Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers!
"
5,22,12,Marshall:,"Barney is right. It is impossible to deny that.
"
5,22,13,"Robin, on the phone:","I refuse. I'd like to come but, I go out with Don Saturday. There is a Chinese.
"
5,22,14,Lily:,"I assume you're talking about cooking, otherwise I would have other issues.
"
5,22,15,Robin:,"I'm sorry, Lily, but I have a chance to Don. And I will not drink out with you every night... especially when ""you"" included two of my ex.
"
5,22,16,Lily:,"I understand. You're right. We miss you much.
"
5,22,17,Robin:,"You too. I gotta go. It is called? (She hangs up) Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident.
"
5,22,18,Barney:,"She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group.
"
5,22,19,Lily:,"Tradition? It was never done.
"
5,22,20,Barney:,"It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted...
"
5,22,21,Ted:,"Goes?
"
5,22,22,Barney:,"I was going to say ""was found eaten by her cats,"" but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it!
"
5,22,23,Lily:,"Do not worry about a baby on our side. It is not yet started.
"
5,22,24,Marshall:,"Absolutely. A small road.
"
5,22,25,Lily:,"A small long road.
"
5,22,26,Marshall:,"But you can see.
"
5,22,27,Lily:,"Very, very far.
"
5,22,28,Marshall:,"But you can see the exit sign.
"
5,22,29,Lily:,"Oh? I see it.
"
5,22,30,Marshall:,"You should put yourself on track.
"
5,22,31,Ted:,"I understand how you feel. It is important friendship. In this regard, Emerson wrote a great poem, titled Friendship. You'll love it. ""A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea...""
"
5,22,32,Ted (2030):,"It's always been like that, with the group as soon as I tried to get some culture.
"
5,22,33,Ted:,"You must try this Syrah. A taste of creme de cassis, red berries, oak heated... (Marshall and Lily are the kitchen while Ted sat on the bench) letter in September, baritone white. Of course! A lyric baritone! Which is higher than a bass-baritone.There is a key moment in the second act of La Boheme...
"
5,22,34,Ted:,"I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. ""Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.""Or, in Italian original...
"
5,22,35,Barney:,"You're right. I exaggerate with this story of Robin. What is an announcement? Wife Robin Don. I'll die alone! Ted eventually eaten by her cats!
"
5,22,36,Ted:,"Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.
"
5,22,37,Barney:,"Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts.
"
5,22,38,Ted (2030):,"Who is Marissa Heller?
"
5,22,39,Ted (2030):,"The mystery began when we moved there 10 years.
"
5,22,40,Marshall:,"Ted! It was our first post! It is popular. It was... a golf magazine for... Marissa Heller. A catalog of wicker furniture, also Marissa Heller. And a voucher for a bird shop... addressed to Marissa Heller... or check it out... ""Current Resident."" It's us! It has mail!
"
5,22,41,Ted:,"Fantastic! That must be the previous tenant. I wonder how it looks.
"
5,22,42,Ted (2030):,"And that's how an image began to form. A picture of Marissa Heller, Marissa... the golfer Heller, one who loves the wicker... And Marissa Heller, ornithophilic.
"
5,22,43,Ted:,"And since, in every mail we receive, the picture becomes clearer. But we know not how it looks. I will follow it as always...
"
5,22,44,Lily:,"Open it.
"
5,22,45,Ted:,"An invitation to the annual Spring Jefferson Van Smoot, for Saturday night... in his apartment in Alberta! Friends... This is the most beautiful building in Manhattan! We gotta go!
"
5,22,46,Marshall:,"It depends, on the invitation, it's about robots fighting wrestlers to rule the galaxy?
"
5,22,47,Ted:,"It's about an open bar.
"
5,22,48,Barney:,"We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller.
"
5,22,49,Marshall:,"I'm flattered but Lily should.
"
5,22,50,Ted (2030):,"The big night arrived. Our first stop... The building Alberta.
"
5,22,51,Ted:,"This building is fabulous! You saw the gate and terracotta panels outside?
"
5,22,52,Lily:,"I just got a text from Robin. It says...
"
5,22,53,Barney:,"Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent.
"
5,22,54,Lily:,"It is certain that it is not English, though? Okay! I do. I go there. (A young woman arrives) Sorry. Go ahead.
"
5,22,55,Woman:,"I come for the reception of Mr. Van Smoot. I'm Marissa Heller.
"
5,22,56,Lily:,"Damn it then!
"
5,22,57,Ted:,"That's Marissa Heller. She is pretty.
"
5,22,58,Marshall:,"She has beautiful teeth. It should not need the reminder cards to go to the dentist.
"
5,22,59,Lily:,"What do we do?
"
5,22,60,Barney:,"I do we go to the party, that's what! (He goes to Marissa) We met at the meeting of ornithophilic.
"
5,22,61,Marissa:,"I do not believe.
"
5,22,62,Barney:,"Lovers of wicker?
"
5,22,63,Marissa:,"No.
"
5,22,64,Ted:,"I'm on it. This lift uses the same mechanism from its installation in 1906. It seems that Lamar Louis Skolnick, the architect of the building, has cut the panels himself.
"
5,22,65,Marissa:,"A fan of Skolnick? I love the juxtaposition between the German Renaissance outside...
"
5,22,66,Ted:,"And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really.
"
5,22,67,"Lily, holding Barney:","No, no. It works.
"
5,22,68,Ted:,"I must make a confession. It is not on the list, but I always wanted to see the inside of Alberta.
"
5,22,69,Marissa:,"So, this way. We are together.
"
5,22,70,Barney:,"I said I'd get us.
"
5,22,71,Lily:,"So... nobody saw The Young and the Restless?
"
5,22,72,Lily:,"Great! Who commissioned illustrated soap? Marissa Heller, I like your style.
"
5,22,73,Lily:,"No one? Do I understand that there is not one fan of soap in this elevator?
"
5,22,74,Marissa:,"I have no television. The only opera I see are at the Met.
"
5,22,75,Ted:,"Prem's.
"
5,22,76,Marissa:,"I'm sorry. Jefferson, my dear.
"
5,22,77,Marshall:,"I'm not dressed for it.
"
5,22,78,Barney:,"In a coined word ""asshole-Apocalypse.""
"
5,22,79,Ted:,"This is Peter Bogdanovich, talking to Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz, crossword editors of The New York Times! Try at least, Chow and alcohol free. 20 minutes and off we go.
"
5,22,80,Man:,"But, the music changed, and Glovanni Artusi, simply do not understand the new way of composing.
"
5,22,81,Ted:,"Sorry, you talk about the fourth book of madrigals?
"
5,22,82,Man:,"Dear boy, what else?
"
5,22,83,Ted:,"This is my favorite book of madrigals.
"
5,22,84,Server:,"smoked foie gras with mango and caramel cream?
"
5,22,85,Marshall:,"You have nothing that resembles a mini cheeseburger?
"
5,22,86,Server:,"I do not think, sir.
"
5,22,87,Marshall:,"Mini pizzas? French fries? Something that makes me think I'm a giant?
"
5,22,88,Server:,"I look, sir.
"
5,22,89,Marshall:,"He will watch it.
"
5,22,90,Barney:,"This morning I made the heart of the Ambassador of the Netherlands. I hope he gets better.
"
5,22,91,Woman:,"Really? A colleague of mine was prescribed Coumadin. And it is impossible it should be anticoagulated and if she had surgery.
"
5,22,92,Ted:,"You know who published an article on great Walt Whitman, and political semantics? Professor Hammersmith Oxford.
"
5,22,93,Woman:,"I'm the teacher Hammersmith.
"
5,22,94,Man:,"That's exactly what Truffaut spoke in his 1954 article in Cahiers du Cinema. Cinema is the substance of the filmmaker.
"
5,22,95,"Marshall, laughing:","Films... right? Actors. Willem Dafoe. Fun Fact of Willem Dafoe, his name sounds a bit like a frog, a parrot that talks. Willem Dafoe...! Willem Dafoe...!
"
5,22,96,Barney:,"As Undersecretary of Finance, I had a great influence on this legislation. Now, I wonder if you will accompany me in the map room to stimulate my package.
"
5,22,97,Woman:,"I do not think, my dear. You're too old for me.
"
5,22,98,Barney:,"Zsa Zsa Gabor is still sexy, but other than that, it is rotten this holiday.
"
5,22,99,Lily:,"We tried, it's been 20 minutes. We are going. Where is Ted?
"
5,22,100,Marshall:,"I know how to find it. Just a second... (They clap a gong) gongs, eh? Stronger than we think.
"
5,22,101,Man:,"Boy, this gong is a relic of 500 years that has not been hit since WS Gilbert at the premiere of The Mikado in London in 1885.
"
5,22,102,Marshall:,"It is the relic of his wife 500 years that has not been hit since WS Gilbert at the premiere of The Mikado in London in 1885.
"
5,22,103,Ted:,"Friends, Will Shortz, editors of the Times crossword. You know, I always say they use ""Ulee"" of Gold Life for vowels? Tell them.
"
5,22,104,Will Shortz:,"That's the vowels.
"
5,22,105,Marshall:,"Can I talk for a second?
"
5,22,106,Ted:,"Ten letters, a diminutive egg pie?
"
5,22,107,Will:,"Mini quiche? Where?
"
5,22,108,Ted:,"There. A great reception.
"
5,22,109,Marshall:,"Grave. We are going. It's time for Robots vs. Wrestlers.
"
5,22,110,Marissa:,"Ted. There you are. We will soon make blind-tests of white wine. It will surely be great.
"
5,22,111,Ted:,"I missed that glitch. I know, do not bother to say. There's no glitch in the wine.
"
5,22,112,Lily:,"Miss Lily in the living room with the chancellor.
"
5,22,113,Man:,"Great God, no! They belonged to Edgar Allan Poe!
"
5,22,114,Lily:,"Sorry!
"
5,22,115,Ted:,"Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.
"
5,22,116,Barney:,"But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game?
"
5,22,117,Ted:,"Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.
"
5,22,118,Barney:,"It's an evening.
"
5,22,119,Lily:,"It means nothing.
"
5,22,120,Barney:,"It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship.
"
5,22,121,Ted:,"See you tomorrow.
"
5,22,122,Barney:,"All right. So you do most of our group, forever. You can ask to return in 2 years. Come see wrestlers fight like robots. I'm embarrassed. I forgot something.
"
5,22,123,Man:,"Where did your buddies?
"
5,22,124,Ted:,"You know, a reading of poetry.
"
5,22,125,Marshall:,"The best tradition of all time!
"
5,22,126,Barney:,"You crazy not me, Marshall. Let's be honest. The group is finite. Ted is gone, like Robin. That separates us as well.
"
5,22,127,Lily:,"Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all.
"
5,22,128,Barney:,"Wait. Why do you say that all of a sudden? My God, you're pregnant!
"
5,22,129,Lily:,"No.
"
5,22,130,Barney:,"My God, have you ever had the baby! It is just behind me, huh?
"
5,22,131,Lily:,"No, silly. One day we all move forward in our lives. It's called growing up.
"
5,22,132,Robot:,"That's all you got, fagot?
"
5,22,133,Barney:,"You can at least promise to not get pregnant within a year?
"
5,22,134,Lily:,"I can not.
"
5,22,135,Barney:,"You can not?
"
5,22,136,Marshall:,"You can not?
"
5,22,137,Ted:,"Citrus and honeycomb with a sharp acidity. This is a Sauvignon Blanc, Loire Valley. The town of Sancerre.
"
5,22,138,Man:,"Okay, again! Bravo, my boy!
"
5,22,139,Barney:,"No! You can not have children! You want to raise a child in this crazy world.
"
5,22,140,Marshall:,"The world is pretty cool right now.
"
5,22,141,Barney:,"Okay, Lily, I have no choice. If you have a daughter, day, no, the minute she is 18... Gong!
"
5,22,142,Marshall:,"Babies.
"
5,22,143,Barney:,"I hope Ted is unhappy.
"
5,22,144,Will:,"Ted, you are a remarkable lyric baritone.
"
5,22,145,Ted:,"Thank you, Will Shortz.
"
5,22,146,Barney:,"Okay, you can have a baby, but only under the following conditions: 1-You promise to always love me more than the baby, 2-Once a month, I can use to shake the baby, 3 - It may include a drop baby from the first floor and that saves me; 4-No breastfeeding in front of me. Forget the five-four, get out your breasts when you want.
"
5,22,147,Ted (2030):,"And something extraordinary happened.
"
5,22,148,Marshall:,"Holy sh1t!
"
5,22,149,Lily:,"I can not believe!
"
5,22,150,Ted:,"Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original... (Thinking...) I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an asshole. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest asshole on the planet. I wish someone stops me.
"
5,22,151,Ted (2030):,"And someone did. Children, I told you that earlier this year, we met with duplicates of ourselves in the city. Robin There was a lesbian. There was the mustachioed Marshall. And, of course, Lily the stripper. That evening, another lookalike appeared... Ted Mexican wrestler.
"
5,22,152,Ted wrestler:,"Soy el conquistador de las maquinas!
"
5,22,153,Ted:,"I gotta run.
"
5,22,154,Barney:,"Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily.
"
5,22,155,Marshall:,"Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?
"
5,22,156,Barney:,"It is not I who make the rules.
"
5,22,157,Marshall:,"Do you really think about all this?
"
5,22,158,Lily:,"I know. Maybe not.
"
5,22,159,Marshall:,"For what it's worth, I think we are ready. We love, we are financially stable, and frankly, it would change that much the way we live.
"
5,22,160,Ted (2030):,"Lily still loves to remind Marshall that said that.
"
5,22,161,Lily:,"If being at home with a baby, tonight we have never seen a dead ringer for Ted. It would make you what, if we had missed it?
"
5,22,162,Marshall:,"I blame the boy for the rest of his life.
"
5,22,163,Lily:,"Right, for his daughter's life.
"
5,22,164,Marshall:,"You're right. No need to rush.
"
5,22,165,Lily:,"What do you say that? We agree that it makes no sense to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?
"
5,22,166,Marshall:,"Sure, it goes without saying.
"
5,22,167,Lily:,"So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?
"
5,22,168,Marshall:,"Deal.
"
5,22,169,Barney:,"Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of asshole that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise.
"
5,22,170,Ted:,"Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. ""A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea The world uncertain comes and goes...""
"
5,22,171,Robin:,"Sorry, someone had to. I pay my tour.
"
5,22,172,Ted (2030):,"Children, let me say that over the years, none of us got a little separated at one time or another. We do not want, but it happens. But whatever had to happen, until now, and whatever happens, we will all, every year, see Robots vs. Wrestlers.
"
5,22,173,Man:,"Good night. Thank you very much, I enjoyed myself so much. Willem Defoe...!
"
5,19,1,Ted (2030):,"Kids, you have to wonder if everything I am telling you is true. And this is normal. After all, the limit is fine between a good story and a lie.
"
5,19,2,Ted (2030):,"No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.
"
5,19,3,Barney:,"I love traveling.
"
5,19,4,Woman:,"Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?
"
5,19,5,Barney:,"Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.
"
5,19,6,Ted:,"You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.
"
5,19,7,Barney:,"Ted, a blonde, it's easy.
"
5,19,8,Barney:,"Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane.
"
5,19,9,Marshall:,"But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.
"
5,19,10,Barney:,"So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space.
"
5,19,11,Ted:,"Why are you lying all the time?
"
5,19,12,Barney:,"I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!
"
5,19,13,Robin:,"I hate my job.
"
5,19,14,Marshall:,"What? You had not interviewed the mayor?
"
5,19,15,Robin:,"Mayor McWouaf. It teaches the children clean, dressed dog. Finally, it is supposed to.
"
5,19,16,Mayor:,"I do not want to talk about Mayor McWouaf. I mean those amazing shoes at Bon Pied-A-Ti! Watch as they absorb the shock!
"
5,19,17,Robin:,"The table! There was a table... Back. (The cameraman has fun throwing papers) were returned.
"
5,19,18,Mike:,"Sorry Robin. I was bored.
"
5,19,19,Robin:,"Yeah, I understand.
"
5,19,20,Robin:,"A single interview proper, it would be nice for a change.
"
5,19,21,Ted:,"Okay, I look at my calendar, see when I'm available. But I want a list of questions in advance and nothing about my private life.
"
5,19,22,Robin:,"Ted, you've nabbed seven peanuts in a row. Impressive but not enough to be published.
"
5,19,23,Marshall:,"You have nabbed seven in a row?
"
5,19,24,Ted:,"seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world.
"
5,19,25,Robin:,"That's the thing with which you played the other day?
"
5,19,26,Ted:,"I was playing it. I was working.
"
5,19,27,Ted:,"""It's you. """" It's me. """" I saw you in the street. """" Are you Annie? """" Yes. ""
"
5,19,28,"Robin, out of his room:","Ted? You redo the end of Sleepless in Seattle with Polly Pocket?
"
5,19,29,Ted:,"How long are you here?
"
5,19,30,Robin:,"Ten seconds.
"
5,19,31,Ted:,"Yeah, just the end.
"
5,19,32,Marshall:,"Again?
"
5,19,33,Lily:,"This is the pizza. Baby, you got the cash?
"
5,19,34,Marshall:,"You know, in fact, it was not me who should pay.Because I do not really like pizza.
"
5,19,35,Lily:,"What!?
"
5,19,36,Ted:,"It was literally across the country a hundred times for a pizza.
"
5,19,37,Lily:,"I even caught a pizza in the shower.
"
5,19,38,Delivery Man:,"Our coupons are your effigy.
"
5,19,39,Barney:,"I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, ""stop eating pizza. ""Marshall:"" Why? ""Doc:"" To you examine. "" But seriously, we laugh because we love you.
"
5,19,40,Marshall:,"Okay, so I have no money on me... it's because... I was assaulted.
"
5,19,41,Lily:,"You...?
"
5,19,42,Ted:,"What?
"
5,19,43,Marshall:,"You can pay Arthur? I have the slab! How is your father, anyway?
"
5,19,44,Arthur:,"Better.
"
5,19,45,Marshall:,"That's good.
"
5,19,46,Lily:,"Did you get mugged?
"
5,19,47,Barney:,"Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said ""Hands up! ""?
"
5,19,48,Marshall:,"Yes, because I was assaulted in 1947 at the corner of Abbott and Costello. But no. I cut through Central Park back from work.
"
5,19,49,Man:,"Watch out. Come any closer.
"
5,19,50,Marshall:,"It's good. It's good.
"
5,19,51,Marshall:,"It was downright terrifying.
"
5,19,52,Barney:,"It was downright terrifying.
"
5,19,53,Marshall:,"What are you doing?
"
5,19,54,Barney:,"I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion.
"
5,19,55,Marshall:,"It will not work. If?
"
5,19,56,Lily:,"Not a bit.
"
5,19,57,Marshall:,"I authorize you to do.
"
5,19,58,Lily:,"I do not think there's a gun to my Marshmallow. Now, I tremble. I think I will not sleep all night.
"
5,19,59,Robin:,"Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep. (She pulls out his gun) Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a f*cking baby.
"
5,19,60,Ted:,"Robin puts it.
"
5,19,61,Robin:,"It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security.
"
5,19,62,Marshall:,"Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a gun. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.
"
5,19,63,Barney:,"I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.
"
5,19,64,Marshall:,"Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?
"
5,19,65,Barney:,"It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. ""
"
5,19,66,Lily:,"Baby, do not worry for me, I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I am New York. I will not let me change it.
"
5,19,67,Lily:,"I changed! I like the weapons now. Charger.
"
5,19,68,Robin:,"Maybe there should be a pause..
"
5,19,69,Lily:,"I said, ""shipper"".
"
5,19,70,Marshall:,"You wanna buy a gun?
"
5,19,71,Lily:,"No one who scares. A tiny Beretta pink that goes with these cute sandals I just bought. In fact, our new credit card works.
"
5,19,72,Marshall:,"You do not need a weapon. All studies in the world come together to say that a home is safer with no weapon, especially ours. You know how I ever hurt you unintentionally.
"
5,19,73,Marshall:,"Pretty easy, huh? (And send the cork in the eye of Lily. Marshall and Lily sleeping when Marshall is a slap to Lily. Marshall before the fridge and opens the door when Lily arrives. They dance loose Lily and Marshall) Dispatch, baby. The party will begin. (Lily is dressed up and scared a killer Marshall puts his fist) You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat!
"
5,19,74,Lily:,"I have changed my mind.
"
5,19,75,Marshall:,"Now, you want to add a weapon in this equation?
"
5,19,76,Lily:,"I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a gun at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would...
"
5,19,77,Marshall:,"I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.
"
5,19,78,Barney:,"So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!
"
5,19,79,Marshall:,"He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all.
"
5,19,80,Ted:,"Wait, so...
"
5,19,81,Man:,"Watch out. Come any closer.
"
5,19,82,Marshall:,"It's good. It's good.
"
5,19,83,Lily:,"He assaulted you naked?
"
5,19,84,Barney:,"I do not ask where he kept his weapon.
"
5,19,85,Ted:,"We're sure it was a weapon?
"
5,19,86,Marshall:,"No, guys. I came home from work on foot. Through Central Park, and I stopped at the zoo.
"
5,19,87,Man:,"Watch out. Come any closer.
"
5,19,88,Marshall:,"It's good. It's good.
"
5,19,89,Barney:,"You're telling us...
"
5,19,90,Ted:,"What you got mugged...
"
5,19,91,Marshall:,"For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.
"
5,19,92,Barney:,"You've been mugged by a monkey?
"
5,19,93,Marshall:,"Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a weapon.
"
5,19,94,Lily:,"Forget the weapon. It is on that now.
"
5,19,95,Ted:,"The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.
"
5,19,96,Lily:,"This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.
"
5,19,97,Barney:,"Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?
"
5,19,98,Marshall:,"Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.
"
5,19,99,"Robin, who happens:","Hi, friends. What's new?
"
5,19,100,Barney:,"New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.
"
5,19,101,Robin:,"Really? They caught him?
"
5,19,102,Ted:,"He is behind bars.
"
5,19,103,Robin:,"So, where did they find?
"
5,19,104,Lily:,"I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.
"
5,19,105,Robin:,"I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.
"
5,19,106,Ted:,"You know how they caught him, huh?
"
5,19,107,Marshall:,"They tracked.
"
5,19,108,Ted:,"They tracked!
"
5,19,109,Robin:,"What's happening?
"
5,19,110,Marshall:,"Okay. That's what happened.
"
5,19,111,Barney:,"No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...
"
5,19,112,Marshall:,"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.
"
5,19,113,Barney:,"You're right. The banana was on the floor.
"
5,19,114,Marshall:,"Was not... Was not banana banana.
"
5,19,115,Barney:,"Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.
"
5,19,116,Marshall:,"Do not shoot. There was no banana!
"
5,19,117,Robin:,"Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.
"
5,19,118,Marshall:,"This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.
"
5,19,119,Lily:,"You've been mugged by a monkey!
"
5,19,120,Ted:,"It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?
"
5,19,121,Ted:,"What? Him in your program? And my model?
"
5,19,122,Robin:,"No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.
"
5,19,123,Ted:,"First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.
"
5,19,124,Robin:,"So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.
"
5,19,125,Men:,"Only if they are holding up well. Last year, I found one of her frolicking with GI Joe. This is not funny. What were you thinking? And if you were pregnant?
"
5,19,126,Ted:,"And you invited back for a second interview.
"
5,19,127,Robin:,"Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?
"
5,19,128,Lily:,"It would be nice to see you on TV.
"
5,19,129,Marshall:,"Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey?
"
5,19,130,Lily:,"You've been mugged by a monkey.
"
5,19,131,Barney:,"I've just been mugged.
"
5,19,132,Ted:,"What?
"
5,19,133,Barney:,"That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...
"
5,19,134,Barney:,"It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.
"
5,19,135,Woman:,"My poor darling.
"
5,19,136,Woman 2:,"Neil? Neil!
"
5,19,137,Barney:,"Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...
"
5,19,138,Woman:,"Why you call it Neil?
"
5,19,139,Woman 2:,"Because it's his name. This is Neil Armstrong.
"
5,19,140,Woman:,"The cyclist?
"
5,19,141,Woman 2:,"You're not supposed to be on a space mission?
"
5,19,142,Woman:,"You've just mugged?
"
5,19,143,Barney:,"Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?
"
5,19,144,Woman 2:,"Me.
"
5,19,145,Woman:,"Me too.
"
5,19,146,Barney:,"And it was the best thing in my life 3.
"
5,19,147,Ted:,"Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.
"
5,19,148,Marshall:,"You're the lemon in your hair.
"
5,19,149,Barney:,"The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...
"
5,19,150,"Robin, entering:","Marshall, you never will believe. I spoke to my producer monkey aggressor and he loves!
"
5,19,151,Marshall:,"Really? Cool.
"
5,19,152,Robin:,"Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?
"
5,19,153,Marshall:,"Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.
"
5,19,154,Robin:,"The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.
"
5,19,155,Marshall:,"Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.
"
5,19,156,Ted:,"It's a little embarrassing. So what?
"
5,19,157,Marshall:,"That's not it. Guys... I'm not assaulted by a monkey.
"
5,19,158,Ted:,"So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?
"
5,19,159,Marshall:,"Not at all.
"
5,19,160,Barney:,"So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?
"
5,19,161,Marshall:,"No, that's not it.
"
5,19,162,Ted:,"So you got the monkey attacked?
"
5,19,163,Marshall:,"Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gun.
"
5,19,164,Barney:,"You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?
"
5,19,165,Ted:,"That would be the right size.
"
5,19,166,Marshall:,"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened.
"
5,19,167,Barney:,"I can not believe.
"
5,19,168,Marshall:,"What?
"
5,19,169,Barney:,"You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.
"
5,19,170,Marshall:,"I would not?
"
5,19,171,Barney:,"If serious, this is too funny.
"
5,19,172,Marshall:,"Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.
"
5,19,173,Barney:,"I, yes, but still.
"
5,19,174,Marshall:,"But I can not lie on national TV.
"
5,19,175,Barney:,"You know a long time. He told the truth?
"
5,19,176,Marshall:,"Ted, do not do that...
"
5,19,177,Ted:,"I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.
"
5,19,178,Barney:,"I still say that it happened.
"
5,19,179,Ted:,"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.
"
5,19,180,Barney:,"Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.
"
5,19,181,Ted:,"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.
"
5,19,182,Barney:,"False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!
"
5,19,183,Marshall:,"You mean what you done to him.
"
5,19,184,Barney:,"No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.
"
5,19,185,Barney:,"Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? (The two women throw their glasses to him the figure) Lisa, wait.
"
5,19,186,Lisa:,"Yes, Neil?
"
5,19,187,Barney:,"It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.
"
5,19,188,Lisa:,"Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.
"
5,19,189,Barney:,"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!
"
5,19,190,"Lily, what happens:","This is the belt of Planar 3?
"
5,19,191,Barney:,"You know it.
"
5,19,192,Lily:,"Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a gun? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey.
"
5,19,193,Marshall:,"You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.
"
5,19,194,Barney:,"Yeah! I knew it.
"
5,19,195,Ted:,"Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.
"
5,19,196,Barney:,"Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?
"
5,19,197,Marshall:,"Come on, Ted.
"
5,19,198,Ted:,"Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.
"
5,19,199,Ted (2030):,"Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin.
"
5,19,200,Robin:,"Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?
"
5,19,201,Ted:,"I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.
"
5,19,202,Robin:,"It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.
"
5,19,203,Barney:,"Dude, what do you do?
"
5,19,204,Ted:,"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.
"
5,19,205,Barney:,"Now I want a weapon.
"
5,19,206,Marshall:,"The monkey is there.
"
5,19,207,Robin:,"Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.
"
5,19,208,Man:,"Because of this incident, we will send Captain Bobo in a nature reserve.
"
5,19,209,Lily:,"I bet he will love it.
"
5,19,210,Man:,"No, ma'am. You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long.
"
5,19,211,Marshall:,"The name of his companion is Milly?
"
5,19,212,Ted (2030):,"And then the interview began.
"
5,19,213,Robin:,"In your own words, describe what happened.
"
5,19,214,Marshall:,"Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.
"
5,19,215,Robin:,"We talk about that. We speak your aggression.
"
5,19,216,Marshall:,"People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it?
"
5,19,217,Robin:,"We come back.
"
5,19,218,Mike:,"It's good.
"
5,19,219,Robin:,"What are you doing?
"
5,19,220,Marshall:,"I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a gun.
"
5,19,221,Lily:,"You have not been attacked by a monkey?
"
5,19,222,Marshall:,"What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.
"
5,19,223,Robin:,"Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.
"
5,19,224,Marshall:,"Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.
"
5,19,225,Lily:,"It's good. I buy a gun.
"
5,19,226,Marshall:,"No. I got mugged.
"
5,19,227,Man:,"So Bobo goes.
"
5,19,228,Marshall:,"No! I have not been mugged!
"
5,19,229,Barney:,"You know if it was attacked?
"
5,19,230,Ted:,"I have no idea.
"
5,19,231,Man:,"Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo?
"
5,19,232,Lily:,"Tell us just what happened.
"
5,19,233,Robin:,"Yes, tell us the truth.
"
5,19,234,Ted (2030):,"And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say.
"
5,19,235,Marshall:,"Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.
"
5,19,236,Ted (2030):,"And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.
"
5,19,237,Robin:,"sh1t. Okay, put a microphone.
"
5,19,238,Ted:,"Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.
"
5,19,239,Barney:,"It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.
"
5,19,240,Ted:,"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.
"
5,19,241,Barney:,"Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.
"
5,19,242,Ted:,"I doubt it.
"
5,19,243,Ted (2030):,"The children you will not believe what happened.
"
5,19,244,Mike:,"The monkey escaped!
"
5,19,245,Male 2:,"It has one of my dolls!
"
5,19,246,Man:,"Bobo, just there, Bobo.
"
5,19,247,Mike:,"He climbs the building!
"
5,19,248,Man:,"Bobo, come here.
"
5,19,249,Mike:,"I'll get it.
"
5,19,250,Ted:,"It's really happening?
"
5,19,251,Barney:,"Of course, Ted.
"
5,19,252,Ted (2030):,"True story.
"
5,24,1,Ted (2030):,"Kids at this moment in history, had been found look-alikes. Lookalikes strange but funky, four of us. Robin There was a lesbian. Marshall... the mustachioed Lily the stripper... and Mexican wrestler myself. Yes, mine was the coolest. And therefore, it was all anxious to find the lookalike fifth, that of Barney. It was more important to some than others.
"
5,24,2,Lily:,"We agree, it's insane to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?
"
5,24,3,Marshall:,"Sure, it goes without saying.
"
5,24,4,Lily:,"So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?
"
5,24,5,Marshall:,"Deal.
"
5,24,6,Ted (2030):,"And one day, a few weeks later...
"
5,24,7,Marshall:,"You were serious with this story of the fifth lookalike?A baby is big enough to let the universe decide.
"
5,24,8,Lily:,"I know, it's crazy. It's easier to let the universe decide. Why?
"
5,24,9,Marshall:,"Decided!
"
5,24,10,Lily:,"Wait 2 seconds! It could easily be Barney who tries to f*ck chicks.
"
5,24,11,Marshall:,"I've moved up.
"
5,24,12,Barney:,"Barney here.
"
5,24,13,Marshall:,"Marshall. So, you're in the office? You're not, I do not know, driving a taxi, with a wig?
"
5,24,14,Barney:,"Yes, I'm in the office. This is the sound of my stapler.This is the sound of my trouilloteuse. And that, the sound of me, ranking the company's directive on sexual harassment. What's new? I gotta run, great leader.
"
5,24,15,Marshall:,"Barney's office. It was the fifth double.
"
5,24,16,Lily:,"Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.
"
5,24,17,Marshall:,"I hasten to add. This is one of the moments you dream about. ""Friends, Lily and I have unprotected relations. ""I have chills.
"
5,24,18,Lily:,"We're going to say anything.
"
5,24,19,Marshall:,"What? Why?
"
5,24,20,Lily:,"If you tell them, they are invited in at the most private and intimate of our lives.
"
5,24,21,Barney:,"You kiss? Go on, I'm not even there. But just like that, have a baby: big mistake. Now, show me.
"
5,24,22,Ted:,"Uncle Ted is here! How you will handle the story of Santa Claus? You should be honest. Damn, I will disguise myself.
"
5,24,23,"Robin, on TV:","It just happened... is that Marshall Eriksen will say to his wife while trying to impregnate her. Helicopter 12 is live at the scene, with ""Baby Alert: 2010.""
"
5,24,24,Marshall:,"Okay. I tell anyone.
"
5,24,25,Lily:,"We saw the fifth lookalike!
"
5,24,26,Robin:,"Incredible!
"
5,24,27,Ted:,"That's great!
"
5,24,28,Robin:,"Bizarre. A Barney Brown.
"
5,24,29,Lily:,"I know. Say what you want about him, but Barney is better blonde.
"
5,24,30,Robin:,"True. The blonde does not go to any guy.
"
5,24,31,Ted:,"I'm not sure.
"
5,24,32,Lily:,"What?
"
5,24,33,Ted:,"This was where I was swimming teacher at Cascade Country Club of Grief, I washed the mop with lemon juice, playing with natural highlights. Let's just say that there were some old pretending to drown. Unfortunately, one has really drowned. In short, blonde suits me.
"
5,24,34,"Marshall, thinking:","Okay you two. We are in a delicate situation but very promising.
"
5,24,35,"Lily, thinking:","If we play well the next minute, Ted goes to bleach their hair.
"
5,24,36,"Robin, thinking:","This is wicked, can not... I just imagine. How do we do?
"
5,24,37,"Ted, thinking:","What we all think? Nachos?
"
5,24,38,"Ted, thinking:","I know. I really had for lunch.
"
5,24,39,"Marshall, thinking:","Several people told him not to do something.Follow me.
"
5,24,40,Ted:,"I do not care, I can eat. Yes, we would like nachos.
"
5,24,41,Marshall:,"I love you buddy, but it is impossible that the blond you go well.
"
5,24,42,Robin:,"It would not look good.
"
5,24,43,Lily:,"Yeah, seriously, Ted, you not discolor hair.
"
5,24,44,Ted:,"I fade hair!
"
5,24,45,Marshall:,"It is not at all what we expected!
"
5,24,46,Ted (2030):,"The children, Robin and Don became such a duo, both outside and inside the screen, that Channel 12 asked them to lead others of their flagship programs.
"
5,24,47,Don:,"So that's why Monty and I have vowed never to take drugs.Because the drug is bad. Not true, Monty?
"
5,24,48,Robin:,"Of course... the chemical stuff, yes. But, what grows in nature, they can try, like, a couple of times.
"
5,24,49,Don:,"We do not try to Shadow Zone, Monty.
"
5,24,50,Robin:,"I think that we should not lie to kids, Moo-Moo!
"
5,24,51,Don:,"So... what do you mean?
"
5,24,52,Robin:,"I've tried drugs.
"
5,24,53,Ted (2030):,"Fun Fact: This episode had the highest ratings.
"
5,24,54,Robin:,"What was that for?
"
5,24,55,Don:,"Before you, I had given up everything. Relationships, my career, my pants. You have given me want to try again. I love you for that.
"
5,24,56,Robin:,"I see...
"
5,24,57,Marshall:,"Sorry. You do not know me. But I wanted to thank you.In fact, you are someone very important in my life.
"
5,24,58,Barney lookalike:,"Important? You mean, legendary? Marshall, it's me!
"
5,24,59,Ted (2030):,"Oddly, this was not the biggest surprise of the day.
"
5,24,60,"Robin, on the phone:","This is rather sudden. Of course, you will have an answer tomorrow. Okay. Thank you. (She hangs up and then remember) Ted, something big has just arrived and you're the most sensitive people I know. That I may see you. (At the hairdresser...) You know what, it can wait.
"
5,24,61,Ted:,"No, go ahead. I'm listening.
"
5,24,62,Robin:,"The executive producer of WNKW saw our show the other morning and I loved it. They offer me the position of presenter, starting next week.
"
5,24,63,Ted:,"That's great!
"
5,24,64,Robin:,"Yes, but here's the thing... WNKW is...
"
5,24,65,Ted:,"Helen, dryer stops!
"
5,24,66,Robin:,"Is Chicago.
"
5,24,67,Marshall:,"You're the fifth double. How can you be you? I called you, Barney. And we talked about!
"
5,24,68,Barney:,"Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know.
"
5,24,69,Barney:,"To make them believe that I break my ass, when in truth I break some ass, I made a special message. What's new? I gotta run, Grand Chief.
"
5,24,70,Marshall:,"It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job.
"
5,24,71,Barney:,"Come, Grand Chief.
"
5,24,72,Marshall:,"Come on. Stops.
"
5,24,73,Robin:,"Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life: career vs. love.
"
5,24,74,Ted:,"""Endless Battle""? Your career has crashed love for years.It's like the Globetrotters vs. the Generals. Crochet career in half, the love is greenhorns who deserve it the Italian league.
"
5,24,75,Robin:,"I'm lost. What do I do?
"
5,24,76,Ted:,"You really need to talk to Don.
"
5,24,77,Robin:,"I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want.
"
5,24,78,Ted:,"It sounds logical. Sorry to not be able to help you more than that. In truth, I can not be objective about the fact you're gone.
"
5,24,79,Robin:,"You did a manicure?
"
5,24,80,Ted:,"No, I did not...
"
5,24,81,Woman:,"It makes a.
"
5,24,82,Marshall:,"Why are you brown taxi driver?
"
5,24,83,Barney:,"Oh, that. You know how I dream of making love to a woman from each country?
"
5,24,84,Marshall:,"Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics.
"
5,24,85,Barney:,"I thought the fastest way to circumnavigate the world in 180 days. Take a taxi and wait before the United Nations.
"
5,24,86,Barney:,"It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected.
"
5,24,87,Barney:,"The girls not want to enter a taxi driver. I worked hard on it.
"
5,24,88,Marshall:,"I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false.
"
5,24,89,Barney:,"What's the problem?
"
5,24,90,Marshall:,"Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children.
"
5,24,91,Barney:,"Children!? No! Rule: no children under 45! You never read my blog!? He has improved a lot.
"
5,24,92,Marshall:,"I'm ready to be a father, you know? But Lily needs a sign of the universe. It could take years.
"
5,24,93,Barney:,"Sorry, pal. It'll be $ 37.50.
"
5,24,94,Ted (2030):,"That night, Marshall returned to the news to Lily.
"
5,24,95,Lily:,"The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, make a baby.
"
5,24,96,Barney:,"They told me, so I've prepared a few. I organize a ""marriage"". Tell me, Billy Idol, it's going to do? More on Billy Idol.If someone wants the real Slim Shady, it's there. This one was good. Robin, why do not you help me?
"
5,24,97,Ted:,"First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.
"
5,24,98,Robin:,"It gets no compliments.
"
5,24,99,Ted:,"The other thing.
"
5,24,100,Robin:,"It may be that I moved to Chicago next week.
"
5,24,101,Marshall:,"Just to know, but it would do the same if we had not seen the Barney look-alike, eh?
"
5,24,102,Lily:,"But we have seen, which means that the universe in its infinite wisdom, tell me of planting, and apply yourself.
"
5,24,103,Marshall:,"I can not. I can in good conscience you plant.
"
5,24,104,Lily:,"I know what's bothering you.
"
5,24,105,Marshall:,"Really?
"
5,24,106,Lily:,"The taxi driver looked like enough to Barney.
"
5,24,107,Marshall:,"Well, there you got wrong.
"
5,24,108,Barney:,"Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.
"
5,24,109,Ted:,"I think Robin...
"
5,24,110,Barney:,"Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.
"
5,24,111,Lily:,"It was smaller than Barney!
"
5,24,112,Marshall:,"It was the same size!
"
5,24,113,Lily:,"And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, this guy was a little Asian with a graying goatee and belly.
"
5,24,114,Marshall:,"You forgot what looks like Barney?
"
5,24,115,Barney:,"You kiss?
"
5,24,116,Marshall:,"Why are you in our room? (Robin's turn to...) Why are you in our room? (Followed by Ted) Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?
"
5,24,117,Ted:,"It works!
"
5,24,118,Barney:,"Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has ""forgotten"" to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.
"
5,24,119,Lily:,"What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?
"
5,24,120,Marshall:,"By omission, because this idea of ""let the world decide"" is crazy.
"
5,24,121,Lily:,"Baby, you...
"
5,24,122,Marshall:,"We must control our...
"
5,24,123,Barney:,"Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.
"
5,24,124,Ted:,"Friends, I'm doing well. Robin has something important to say.
"
5,24,125,Robin:,"It failed him.
"
5,24,126,Ted:,"The other thing.
"
5,24,127,Robin:,"He had a manicure.
"
5,24,128,Ted:,"The other thing.
"
5,24,129,Robin:,"I had a job offer in Chicago.
"
5,24,130,Barney:,"That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter...
"
5,24,131,Robin:,"Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept.
"
5,24,132,Ted:,"I can not believe that Robin is going to lose.
"
5,24,133,"Lily, thinking:","Perhaps it's the depression talking, but Ted's hair beginning to be well?
"
5,24,134,"Marshall, thinking:","Thank God, I thought I was the only one!
"
5,24,135,"Barney, thinking:","Looks like a real movie star!
"
5,24,136,Ted:,"And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair.
"
5,24,137,Lily:,"Finally.
"
5,24,138,Marshall:,"I told you so.
"
5,24,139,Barney:,"Not so great that.
"
5,24,140,Robin:,"So I was on the phone with Chicago.
"
5,24,141,Robin:,"Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you.
"
5,24,142,Robin:,"I'm staying.
"
5,24,143,Marshall:,"Tell me... Did you see the real Barney driving the taxi, and you thought it was a little Asian pot-bellied.
"
5,24,144,Lily:,"I know. It's weird, huh?
"
5,24,145,Marshall:,"It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney.
"
5,24,146,Robin:,"Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?
"
5,24,147,Don:,"You'll never believe it. I was offered the position of presenter WNKW in Chicago.
"
5,24,148,Robin:,"You said what?
"
5,24,149,Don:,"I agreed. It's been years I expect this opportunity.
"
5,24,150,Marshall:,"Barney?
"
5,24,151,Sosie:,"I'm single mountebank of Estonia. Who is this Barney?
"
5,24,152,Marshall:,"It's just a guy we know who has a blog and really bad.
"
5,24,153,Sosia:,"It seems that he is improving. Finally, what is it, ""blog""?
"
5,24,154,Marshall:,"This is something that was cool 8 years ago.
"
5,24,155,Sosia:,"Always cool. It looks pretty cool.
"
5,24,156,Lily:,"What's your name?
"
5,24,157,Sosia:,"Kristof.
"
5,24,158,Lily:,"how Kristof?
"
5,24,159,Sosia:,"Kristof... Sosie.
"
5,24,160,Marshall:,"Really? Your last name is ""Sosie""?
"
5,24,161,Lookalike:,"It's my name, man.
"
5,24,162,Don:,"Wait. Trying to understand.
"
5,24,163,Robin:,"I'm going.
"
5,24,164,Don:,"Wait. Put yourself in my place. You can imagine what it is to be offered a dream job?
"
5,24,165,Robin:,"I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.
"
5,24,166,Lily:,"Barney, why are you doing this?
"
5,24,167,Marshall:,"Wait a second. Is it possible that Barney Stinson secretly hope they have children?
"
5,24,168,Sosia:,"Who is Barney? Calm down the U.S.!
"
5,24,169,Lily:,"Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years.
"
5,24,170,Sosie:,"I'd be interested to read what he has to say in his blog.
"
5,24,171,Lily:,"But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing.
"
5,24,172,Sosia:,"Babies... this can be cute.
"
5,24,173,Lily:,"And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family.
"
5,24,174,Woman:,"Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.
"
5,24,175,Barney:,"Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!
"
5,24,176,Woman:,"And I'm like you clown.
"
5,24,177,Robin:,"Say yes to that.
"
5,24,178,Ted:,"Yes.
"
5,24,179,Robin:,"I can re-move? (Ted takes her in his arms. They sit on the couch) Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?
"
5,24,180,Ted:,"Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.
"
5,24,181,Robin:,"Seems like I become more and more stupid.
"
5,24,182,Ted:,"Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The ""Robin, there was 5 years""? This girl was pretty cool. Robin lookalike? She's great. (They are close) We drank a lot.
"
5,24,183,Robin:,"I do not care.
"
5,24,184,Ted:,"What? I forgot, I'm blond. I have blonde hair.
"
5,24,185,Ted (2030):,"And here's how my hair bleached prevented us from doing anything that would have regretted. Children, the world is fun.
"
5,24,186,Lily:,"Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!
"
5,24,187,Barney:,"Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least.
"
5,24,188,Lily:,"The friends, follow me! (They leave) Look! The fifth double.
"
5,24,189,Barney:,"This guy looks like me...
"
5,24,190,Marshall:,"Guys... Play the game
"
5,24,191,Ted (2030):,"Children, you can ask the universe all the signs of the world...
"
5,24,192,Marshall:,"It's amazing.
"
5,24,193,Lily:,"Is not it?
"
5,24,194,Robin:,"It looks like Barney.
"
5,24,195,Ted:,"Amazing.
"
5,24,196,Barney:,"It's like looking in a mirror.
"
5,24,197,Ted (2030):,"But ultimately, we see only what we want to see, when you're ready to see it.
"
5,24,198,Marshall:,"Does that mean...?
"
5,24,199,Lily:,"Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.
"
5,18,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, your aunt Lily has always been among those who like their birthday. Really.
"
5,18,2,The alarm goes off at 12:,"00 and Lily wakes.
"
5,18,3,Lily:,"It's my birthday!
"
5,18,4,Ted (2030):,"It's a good thing she married Marshall.
"
5,18,5,The clock shows 9:,"00.
"
5,18,6,Lily:,"It's still my birthday!
"
5,18,7,Ted (2030):,"Because he loves to prepare on birthdays.
"
5,18,8,Marshall:,"Feliz cumpleanos, baby. The theme of this breakfast in bed is... ""Spanish Interlude."" (A musician enters the room and opens the curtain Marshall) How have we landed on the lyric rolling hills of northern Spain? Baby, it will be huge tonight. We five, dinner well dressed, and Ted brings your cognac cheesecake Pumpkin at Edgar. I'll go shopping super secret birthday. And I took him because I do not like the way he looks at you.
"
5,18,9,Lily:,"A new camera! Thank you, Marshall. I love it!
"
5,18,10,Marshall:,"Small bonus, I took pictures of me naked before packing. With a node.
"
5,18,11,Lily:,"There was not a knot.
"
5,18,12,Marshall:,"On the other device.
"
5,18,13,Lily:,"Thank you. I will make great photos of our group with that.
"
5,18,14,Ted (2030):,"Children, have you seen the photo album of Lily... Bound in leather, acid-free paper, adorable handwritten captions. And most importantly, the group photo. Nice picture, eh? But what you do not see are the 10 seconds before this photo was taken.
"
5,18,15,Lily:,"I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.
"
5,18,16,Barney:,"Why?
"
5,18,17,Lily:,"You know... Light, color, balance, aperture...
"
5,18,18,Robin:,"You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?
"
5,18,19,Lily:,"Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.
"
5,18,20,Barney:,"How dare you?
"
5,18,21,Robin:,"It's so rude.
"
5,18,22,Barney:,"It's true.
"
5,18,23,Robin:,"Totally. It is a tightrope, but still.
"
5,18,24,Ted (2030):,"We hated group photos of Lily.
"
5,18,25,Lily:,"Okay, I am perhaps a little bossy, but I want to remember it all. Like tonight. I imagine no better birthday being with my 4 best friends only. (A knock at the door) And Ted's here.
"
5,18,26,Ted:,"Happy Birthday! Here is Amanda.
"
5,18,27,Lily:,"And Amanda...
"
5,18,28,Marshall:,"Ted, you had to bring a cheesecake, but you've brought two shopping bags and a girl who knows not. My name is Marshall. Welcome. Ted talks.
"
5,18,29,Ted:,"Amanda will make a cake for Lily. She is head. We met at the restaurant last week when I returned my soup. Fortunately, she has such beautiful hair it not bother me a bit to eat.
"
5,18,30,Amanda:,"I've nicknamed ""Lose hair 'at work.
"
5,18,31,Lily:,"I'm really happy you make me my cake.
"
5,18,32,Marshall:,"In honor of the 32nd anniversary of Lily, I expected a lot of great games, beginning with... ""Lil-ial Pursuit."" Who has the number 1?
"
5,18,33,Amanda:,"Me.
"
5,18,34,Marshall:,"Sure. Okay, this is Amanda begins. You have 32 seconds to answer a ton of questions. And... Here we go. Lily's favorite color?
"
5,18,35,Amanda:,"Well, she wears pink, so I'll say pink.
"
5,18,36,Marshall:,"It's Robin.
"
5,18,37,Amanda:,"Her favorite color is... leg.
"
5,18,38,Marshall:,"I think Ted whispered the word ""yellow"". It is equally untrue. (Later...) This game is called... raising the cost of perfection.
"
5,18,39,Lily:,"Pretty.
"
5,18,40,Marshall:,"Thank you. You wrote all that you love our queen of the day. And Lilypad, you must guess who wrote what. ""From his friends to his students, Lily that everyone in his life...""
"
5,18,41,Ted:,"Lily is a teacher. Hence the ""students"".
"
5,18,42,Marshall:,"""... feel loved. She makes the best cookies oatmeal raisin-, The Goonies knows by heart... ""
"
5,18,43,Ted:,"Lily saw The Goonies just after his parents separated. After that, she had real problems of trust.
"
5,18,44,Marshall:,"""And that's the strongest person I know. I can not imagine my life without her. I love you, Lily.
"
5,18,45,Robin:,"Of course it was me.
"
5,18,46,Lily:,"Come here.
"
5,18,47,Marshall:,"Too cute. Lily, guess who wrote it. ""You look really nice.""
"
5,18,48,Lily:,"I would say Amanda.
"
5,18,49,Barney:,"No, it was me. And I meant it.
"
5,18,50,Amanda:,"Well, I'm going to finish the cake.
"
5,18,51,Lily:,"Tell me if you need help. (Amanda from the kitchen) Quick, group photo! All front of the fireplace.
"
5,18,52,Ted:,"Wait, I'll find Amanda.
"
5,18,53,Lily:,"No problem, it is occupied. The bother, come on.
"
5,18,54,Ted:,"Wait... You do not want Amanda on the picture, right?
"
5,18,55,Lily:,"Well, you know, auto focus, speed of obstruction, zoom...
"
5,18,56,Ted:,"Lily, what's the matter?
"
5,18,57,Marshall:,"Who wants a party hat? I'm a bird! All do the bird!
"
5,18,58,Ted:,"Tell me the truth.
"
5,18,59,Lily:,"Of course not. I let another of your bitches spoil my memories.
"
5,18,60,Ted:,"Lily, what are you talking?
"
5,18,61,Lily:,"Ted, you always do that. You bring a girl knows that not all our evenings with us.
"
5,18,62,Ted:,"That's not true.
"
5,18,63,Lily:,"Really? So, let us walk bitch Street Shuffle.
"
5,18,64,Marshall:,"Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.
"
5,18,65,Barney:,"I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!
"
5,18,66,Marshall:,"My friends, I made a song for tonight. Follow me, the chorus is this: Merry, Merry Lily-anniversary...
"
5,18,67,Lily:,"Christmas morning, there was 4. Our first Christmas together, just us five. Here's another nice little game. It's called, Appoints This Bitch.
"
5,18,68,Ted:,"That's Pap Pa......
"
5,18,69,Lily:,"False. You think the Santa Claus, because it was Christmas.
"
5,18,70,Robin:,"Funny. Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny.
"
5,18,71,Ted:,"I remember, this is Sarah.
"
5,18,72,Lily:,"Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, ""Folks, this may be good."" And this is not the only ""maybe good"". Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and ""It's good"" Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... ""It proves that you selected the eyes closed"" Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance.
"
5,18,73,Barney:,"You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?
"
5,18,74,Barney:,"Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from Guns N'Roses!
"
5,18,75,Lily:,"Group Photo!
"
5,18,76,Barney:,"And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?
"
5,18,77,Robin:,"It was there, we know the end.
"
5,18,78,Barney:,"False!
"
5,18,79,Robin:,"The funny for this photo. I plottait ass.
"
5,18,80,Lily:,"Oh? So do I.
"
5,18,81,Barney:,"And me too. He has how many hands?
"
5,18,82,Ted:,"Normal if it is good guitarist.
"
5,18,83,Marshall:,"Actually, sorry, man. I had you taken to Lily.
"
5,18,84,Robin:,"Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.
"
5,18,85,Barney:,"Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.
"
5,18,86,Robin:,"It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.
"
5,18,87,Barney:,"Nope, not at all.
"
5,18,88,Robin:,"And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.
"
5,18,89,Barney:,"Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.
"
5,18,90,Ted (2030):,"He was right. Your uncle Marshall is many things well, but for the pictures, it's terrible.
"
5,18,91,Marshall:,"They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.
"
5,18,92,Barney:,"You really put a knot!
"
5,18,93,Robin:,"A crisp, Barney?
"
5,18,94,Barney:,"Of course.
"
5,18,95,Robin:,"I! A photo ugly.
"
5,18,96,Barney:,"You sure?
"
5,18,97,Robin:,"No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?
"
5,18,98,Barney:,"It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.
"
5,18,99,Ted:,"Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?
"
5,18,100,Lily:,"These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris.
"
5,18,101,Robin:,"This is what happened in Paris?
"
5,18,102,Lily:,"In the first year of college, I studied in Paris, and I had not seen Marshall since 2 months.
"
5,18,103,Marshall:,"2 months. And I just started making love. I was not ready to stop for 2 months.
"
5,18,104,Lily:,"And Marshall came to me to spring break. And at the last minute, Ted decided to go with the girl he had just to get back, Karen.
"
5,18,105,Ted:,"I'm so excited you're here.
"
5,18,106,Karen:,"I'm so excited to go to Paris.
"
5,18,107,Marshall:,"I'm so excited to remake love.
"
5,18,108,Lily:,"But just before takeoff...
"
5,18,109,Karen:,"Wait, I must tell you something.
"
5,18,110,Ted:,"Really? Because I think I want to tell you the same thing.
"
5,18,111,Karen:,"Do your thing is, I slept with the philosophy teacher last night? Because I do.
"
5,18,112,Lily:,"And so began the longest 7:30 of Marshall's life. When I went to look for...
"
5,18,113,Karen:,"Ted broke. I have to sleep in your room this week.Marshall will go with Ted.
"
5,18,114,Marshall:,"2 months! My balls were blue! Blue!
"
5,18,115,Lily:,"It will not surprise you, but the rest of the trip was horrible. I did a picture of a romantic kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower, I actually had. It was just between Karen and Francis, our server yesterday.
"
5,18,116,Robin:,"It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Barney looks to pick it up) Mouse, m*therf*cker! I!
"
5,18,117,Barney:,"You sure?
"
5,18,118,Robin:,"Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!
"
5,18,119,Barney:,"The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.
"
5,18,120,Ted:,"I feel sorry for Paris and group photos ruined, but... when you're single, you must hope that every girl is good. I mean, Erin.Irene.
"
5,18,121,Lily:,"Emily. Isabelle.
"
5,18,122,Ted:,"And Sarah.
"
5,18,123,Lily:,"Leilani! What's your problem?
"
5,18,124,Ted:,"At the time, I thought each of these girls could be good, but I have to keep hoping. I have no choice.
"
5,18,125,Lily:,"Here is another. More random bitch to my birthday! Hey, baby!
"
5,18,126,Amanda:,"You have a cake rack?
"
5,18,127,Lily:,"The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best!
"
5,18,128,Robin:,"I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever.
"
5,18,129,Woman:,"Names that bitch!
"
5,18,130,Man:,"Uh...
"
5,18,131,Lily:,"You should listen to Robin.
"
5,18,132,Ted:,"Because Robin is your best friend.
"
5,18,133,Lily:,"Right.
"
5,18,134,Ted:,"Your best friend on Earth.
"
5,18,135,Lily:,"Absolutely.
"
5,18,136,Marshall:,"Attention Lily. It's a trap.
"
5,18,137,Ted:,"Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts.
"
5,18,138,Lily:,"Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches.
"
5,18,139,Robin:,"I'm starting to cry.
"
5,18,140,Marshall:,"It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this: ""She's cute She's cute.""
"
5,18,141,Ted:,"I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family.
"
5,18,142,Marshall Robin. Your part is this:,"""And nice and sweet and so nice! ""
"
5,18,143,Lily:,"Yes. We are a family. So why these parties can not they be us?
"
5,18,144,Lily:,"Like the time we celebrated the success of Marshall to the bar.
"
5,18,145,Ted:,"Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out.
"
5,18,146,Ted:,"I did not say that!
"
5,18,147,Lily:,"It's as if you had done.
"
5,18,148,Ted:,"Here's Framboise.
"
5,18,149,Marshall:,"You must order more food?
"
5,18,150,Ted:,"No. Raspberry does not eat.
"
5,18,151,Raspberry:,"I am a vegetarian.
"
5,18,152,Lily:,"Let us raise our glasses. During the last 3 years, Marshall has worked so hard, and I am so proud of you.
"
5,18,153,Raspberry:,"Meat is murder! (She throws her drink in hand and cook) Murder!
"
5,18,154,Ted:,"I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?
"
5,18,155,All:,"It was called Raspberry!
"
5,18,156,Ted:,"If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.
"
5,18,157,Marshall:,"Look. We're all friends again! Now working on the harmonies. Merry, Merry Lily-versary! Merry, Merry Lily-versary!
"
5,18,158,Amanda:,"And that's it. I hope you will like.
"
5,18,159,Lily:,"""Happy 42nd Birthday, Lori.""
"
5,18,160,Ted (2030):,"Children, you remember the look ""you're dead to me"" Lily, she has this expression before exploding in a rage?Well, that was not it. But it was that of Marshall.
"
5,18,161,Marshall:,"""42nd""? Does the f*cking bomb appeared to have 42 years? Or worse, she has a mind to call Lori?!
"
5,18,162,Lily:,"No, Marshall, it does not matter.
"
5,18,163,Marshall:,"If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house!
"
5,18,164,Amanda:,"I'm sorry.
"
5,18,165,Marshall:,"Out!
"
5,18,166,Ted:,"Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.
"
5,18,167,Marshall:,"You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.
"
5,18,168,Ted:,"What are you talking?
"
5,18,169,Marshall:,"You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.
"
5,18,170,Marshall:,"I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?
"
5,18,171,Natalie:,"We broke... again! You sit with me a little while? Just sit down?
"
5,18,172,Marshall:,"You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.
"
5,18,173,Marshall:,"And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical.
"
5,18,174,Marshall:,"I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear.
"
5,18,175,Woman:,"I just thought we had something special, you know?
"
5,18,176,Marshall:,"Me too. Yeah. But you know, life goes darling.
"
5,18,177,Woman:,"I know if I'll get over it.
"
5,18,178,Marshall:,"Shut up.
"
5,18,179,Ted:,"Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.
"
5,18,180,Barney:,"They would be if Marshall was not on it.
"
5,18,181,Marshall:,"Cheap Shot. Low blow.
"
5,18,182,Ted:,"You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.
"
5,18,183,Lily:,"This is not true!
"
5,18,184,Ted:,"Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.
"
5,18,185,Marshall:,"It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.
"
5,18,186,Ted:,"And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.
"
5,18,187,Robin:,"And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.
"
5,18,188,Lily:,"Yeah, but you were beautiful.
"
5,18,189,Robin:,"And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.
"
5,18,190,Marshall:,"Actually, it was a good evening.
"
5,18,191,Lily:,"It's true.
"
5,18,192,Ted:,"Yeah, that was good.
"
5,18,193,Lily:,"Look at that one. This is the first picture of us three.
"
5,18,194,Marshall:,"It's true.
"
5,18,195,Ted:,"Do you remember what happened?
"
5,18,196,Man:,"Well, are you ready?
"
5,18,197,Ted:,"Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?
"
5,18,198,Marshall:,"No! Why not sitcom of the 80s with two roommates who never agree?
"
5,18,199,Man:,"Cool. Fine. One, two...
"
5,18,200,Lily:,"Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film?
"
5,18,201,Marshall:,"Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate.
"
5,18,202,Ted:,"And if you came to ask us?
"
5,18,203,Lily:,"Really?
"
5,18,204,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
5,18,205,Marshall:,"What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks?
"
5,18,206,Ted:,"And if you break it?
"
5,18,207,Marshall:,"Come.
"
5,18,208,Lily:,"I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo.
"
5,18,209,Ted:,"I liked you.
"
5,18,210,Lily:,"We must bring back Amanda.
"
5,18,211,Ted:,"Really?
"
5,18,212,Lily:,"You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.
"
5,18,213,Ted:,"Thank you, Lil.
"
5,18,214,Robin:,"I think Lori's age made him very wise.
"
5,18,215,Barney:,"It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.
"
5,18,216,Ted (2030):,"So your aunt Lily called Amanda.
"
5,18,217,Lily:,"Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.
"
5,18,218,Ted:,"Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.
"
5,18,219,Robin:,"It's a hole in your jacket?
"
5,18,220,Barney:,"What? Where?
"
5,18,221,Ted:,"Now, Marshall!
"
5,18,222,Robin:,"sh1t!
"
5,18,223,Lily:,"Names that bitch.
"
5,18,224,Ted:,"Ann has...? Anna?
"
5,18,225,Lily:,"No, it was my birthday.
"
5,18,226,Marshall:,"Your brain is too predictable associations.
"
5,18,227,Lily:,"Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.
"
5,18,228,Barney:,"Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...
"
5,18,229,Robin:,"Yes!
"
5,15,1,TV anchor:,"""Welcome back to Superbowl XLIV in Miami. Get a load of that guy! You think that's his real number?""
"
5,15,2,Ted:,"Well, that explains where Barney is.
"
5,15,3,Robin:,"Dibs on his wings!
"
5,15,4,Barney:,"Hey, guys!
"
5,15,5,Ted:,"Hey!
"
5,15,6,Barney:,"Does anyone know who won the Superbowl?
"
5,15,7,Marshall:,"You were there. It was the...
"
5,15,8,Barney:,"I won! Because I'm now in possession of a magic phone that always rings. And you know who's always usually on the other end? A chick. So how many chicks do I have calling me now? Infinity! Guys, remember Ranjit?
"
5,15,9,Ranjit:,"Hello.
"
5,15,10,Ted:,"Hey, Ranjit!
"
5,15,11,Marshall:,"Good to see you.
"
5,15,12,Barney:,"OK I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women and I don't want to take the subway cause... you know... germs!
"
5,15,13,Ted:,"Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you?
"
5,15,14,Barney:,"Oh, indubitably! I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes pealed for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic and want to 96 me, semi-colon and parenthesis.
"
5,15,15,Ted:,"This ought to be good. I can only imagine the quality of girls...
"
5,15,16,Red-sweater girl:,"Hi, you ARE the guy from the Superbowl.
"
5,15,17,Barney:,"Magic phone, guys. (whispers) Magic phone!
"
5,15,18,Robin:,"Oh, hey guys, hey Ranjit.
"
5,15,19,Lily:,"Hey.
"
5,15,20,Marshall:,"How's it going?
"
5,15,21,Ted:,"That beer looks a little flat.
"
5,15,22,Robin:,"Nuh, it's scotch.
"
5,15,23,Ted:,"Something troubling you, kiddo?
"
5,15,24,Robin:,"Hhhhh Don.
"
5,15,25,Don:,"Oh yeahh!
"
5,15,26,Robin:,"Now that's what I call having a woof over your head. Don. DON?
"
5,15,27,Don:,"Why is ""Ulee's Gold"" in every crossword? On to me? Sorry, sorry... Next Sunday is Valentine's Day. And one lucky patient will be receiving a very special chocolate heart: a human heart. OK, that reminds me, I've been meaning to ask you... Robin, do you have any Valentine's Day plans?
"
5,15,28,Lily:,"He asked you out?
"
5,15,29,Robin:,"He asked me out.
"
5,15,30,Ted:,"That's crazy! And they use ""Ulee"" because of the vowels.
"
5,15,31,Marshall:,"What did you say?
"
5,15,32,Robin:,"Well we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said OK.
"
5,15,33,Lily:,"Oh, oh, oh!
"
5,15,34,Marshall:,"Robin, you're gonna marry this man so freaking hard, right in the butt.
"
5,15,35,Robin:,"What? Nooo I HATE Don. And now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air.
"
5,15,36,Marshall:,"What would your viewers think?
"
5,15,37,Ted:,"Wow wow wow, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans!
"
5,15,38,Robin:,"Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan?
"
5,15,39,Ted:,"I did NOT...say... it was a good plan.
"
5,15,40,Barney:,"Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now. And it is getting in-teh-resting. Looks at these texts. Read this one. Yowza! Now look at this one. Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now look at this one... or this one, or this one, or this one, or...
"
5,15,41,Ted:,"OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.
"
5,15,42,Barney:,"I can't do that, Ted. I just can't hook up with a girl if there is a hotter girl out there with whom up can be hooked.
"
5,15,43,Lily:,"Isn't there always a hotter girl?
"
5,15,44,Barney:,"I know, isn't it wonderful? (answers phone) Go for Barney. Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?...Oh, hi Mom!
"
5,15,45,Ted:,"So there's a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options. You got internet dating, you got bars...
"
5,15,46,Lily:,"Holding up your phone number on national TV.
"
5,15,47,Ranjit:,"I never had that problem. When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage. And I love my wife more and more every day.
"
5,15,48,Ted:,"Hm.
"
5,15,49,Marshall:,"It is true. It's very rare that two people just meet and fall madly in love... like Robin and Don.
"
5,15,50,Robin:,"Oh but we're not even like going out for dinner, we're just hanging out at his place.
"
5,15,51,All of them:,"Ooohhh ahh!
"
5,15,52,Robin:,"No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people.
"
5,15,53,All the them:,"Wooooooo!... (then they stop and think)
"
5,15,54,Lily:,"Wait, Robin, what exactly did Don say when he asked you out?
"
5,15,55,Don:,"I'm having some friends over at my place for a party. You should come by if you want.
"
5,15,56,Robin:,"Errrrrrr...I... OK.
"
5,15,57,Lily:,"Robin, Don didn't ask you out.
"
5,15,58,Robin:,"Err, of course he asked me out.
"
5,15,59,Ted:,"Err no he didn't.
"
5,15,60,Robin:,"Yes, he did. He did. He did. He DID!
"
5,15,61,Ranjit:,"OK.
"
5,15,62,Marshall:,"Well, dog my cats! I think I know what's going on here. Robin... did you WANT Don to ask out?
"
5,15,63,Robin:,"Whaaat?!! (in a high voice) (huffs) Nooo, I HATE Don! I-I-I can't stop thinking how much I hate him, it's like, it's like... all the time. I just wanna attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. SHUT UP!! (leaves the table)
"
5,15,64,Ted:,"See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arrange-marriage me!
"
5,15,65,Barney:,"(walks by, phone ringing)Or this one, or this one, or this one...
"
5,15,66,Marshall:,"You want us to arrange your marriage?
"
5,15,67,Ted:,"Absolutely. Looks there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked, I'm good at. Ladies looove Teddy Westside.
"
5,15,68,Marshall:,"You're waiting for me to comment on your self-assigned nickname? Well, here's my comment. I love it.
"
5,15,69,Ted:,"Really?! (excited)
"
5,15,70,Marshall:,"Teddy Westside? Continue.
"
5,15,71,Ted:,"It's the picking, I suck at. I pick the wrong girls. But you guys, you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other.
"
5,15,72,Lily:,"Oh well with the slight assist from the Wesleyan housing department.
"
5,15,73,Marshall:,"And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir. (they hive five) (Robin giggles)
"
5,15,74,Ted:,"Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.
"
5,15,75,Marshall:,"I love that blazer. Almost as much as Robin loves Don.
"
5,15,76,Robin:,"I do not love Don.
"
5,15,77,Marshall:,"Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.
"
5,15,78,Ted:,"You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.
"
5,15,79,Ted:,"OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, ""wait a second, it's a duck!"" Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?
"
5,15,80,Marshall:,"Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought ""This guy's a duck"", but one of these days you're gonna realize ""This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit"".
"
5,15,81,Ted:,"Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate.
"
5,15,82,Marshall:,"What?!!
"
5,15,83,Robin:,"Yeah I got to agree. Duck's up, rabbit down.
"
5,15,84,Lily:,"Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits.
"
5,15,85,Marshall:,"I got... ducks are... ducks are... rabbits are adorable. Ducks are aargh. Have you ever been in a fight with a duck? I mean, ducks are... jerks.
"
5,15,86,Ted:,"Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey.
"
5,15,87,Marshall:,"(yelling) We're not talking about flavour, Ted.
"
5,15,88,Ted:,"(yelling as well) Flavour counts.
"
5,15,89,Marshall:,"Who carries a duck's foot for good luck? Anyone?
"
5,15,90,Robin:,"You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair. (almost yells) I wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers. Who's cosier? No, no, no, no, no, no... who's cosier?
"
5,15,91,Ted:,"Hold on, I've got to get another book.
"
5,15,92,Ted:,"Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out?
"
5,15,93,Marshall:,"Because it's illegal, Ted!
"
5,15,94,Ted:,"Only if we bet on it, Marshall!
"
5,15,95,Marshall:,"FINE! I CAN SEE IT! YOU WIN!
"
5,15,96,Robin:,"Say it.
"
5,15,97,Ted:,"You have to say it.
"
5,15,98,Marshall:,"Duck's good... (long pause, then whispers...) rabbit's bad.
"
5,15,99,Robin:,"YAYYYYY.
"
5,15,100,Lily:,"YAY.
"
5,15,101,Ted:,"YESSS.
"
5,15,102,Robin:,"Thank you. And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit.
"
5,15,103,Ted:,"Oh I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin. Think about it. Don... Donald. Donald... Duck. (Marshall sighs heavily) And what, I wonder, does Donald Duck never wear?
"
5,15,104,Lily:,"Pants.
"
5,15,105,Ted:,"Pants. Don's... a duck. (Lily and Marshall sigh in awe of Ted) Permission to say ""lawyered""?
"
5,15,106,Marshall:,"I'll allow it.
"
5,15,107,Ted:,"Lawyered.
"
5,15,108,Barney:,"There is no place I would rather be and no one I would rather be with... (phone rings) I should get that. (picks up in the kitchen) Go for Barney... Look, I'm sort of in the middle of someone, something right now and I... You're a hot lady bullfighter?... (to the girl in his room) You gotta go.
"
5,15,109,Barney:,"McLaren's pub.
"
5,15,110,Ranjit:,"McLaren's pub.
"
5,15,111,Barney:,"Well, heeelllooo.
"
5,15,112,Barney:,"There is no place I would rather be, and no one I would rather be... (phone rings) Would you excuse me for one moment? (picks up in the kitchen) Go for Barney, look, I... You're a gold medalist japanese figure skater? (to the lady bullfighter) Adios, muchacha!
"
5,15,113,Barney:,"McLaren's pub.
"
5,15,114,Ranjit:,"McLaren's pub.
"
5,15,115,Barney:,"Well, heeelllooo.
"
5,15,116,Barney:,"No place I'd rather be, no one I'd rather b... (phone rings) baaah... for Pete's sake. (picks up in the kitchen) You're a HOT chick? (to the skater) Sayonara.
"
5,15,117,Barney:,"McLaren's pub.
"
5,15,118,Ranjit:,"McLaren's pub.
"
5,15,119,Barney:,"Well, heeelllooo.
"
5,15,120,Hot Chick:,"I realize that you're very busy, so I'll just get straight to the point.
"
5,15,121,Barney:,"OK.
"
5,15,122,Barney:,"Ay ay ay.
"
5,15,123,Hot Chick:,"And that's my bad leg. Very bad. (phone rings) Are you OK?
"
5,15,124,Barney:,"Yeah of course. Why, why wouldn't I be?... (picks up) Go for Barney.
"
5,15,125,Barney:,"I'm free.
"
5,15,126,Barney:,"Ahh now this feels right. There is no place I would rather be, and no one I would rather be... (hears THE phone ringing)
"
5,15,127,Hot Chick:,"What's wrong?
"
5,15,128,Barney:,"Did you hear that?
"
5,15,129,Hot Chick:,"Hear what?
"
5,15,130,Barney:,"Shhhhhhhh. (loses his mind) aaahhhh
"
5,15,131,Barney:,"McLaren's pub!!
"
5,15,132,Ranjit:,"McLaren's pub!
"
5,15,133,Barney:,"(crying) Go-o for Barrr-neeeeyy. (back to business) D cups, really?
"
5,15,134,Marshall:,"Aren't we supposed to go on a double date with Ted?
"
5,15,135,Lily:,"Ted? No, he's not seeing anyone. Remember, he asked us to find...
"
5,15,136,Marshall:,"Oh, no.
"
5,15,137,Marshall:,"Hey! Hey, wanna get married?
"
5,15,138,Lily:,"(annoyed) I don't know what kind of architect? Houses, buildings, that kind of crap.
"
5,15,139,Marshall:,"(to the 1st one) Wanna marry my friend Ted? (to the 2nd one) Wanna marry my friend Ted? (to the 3d one) Wanna marry my friend Ted?
"
5,15,140,Lily:,"You can be choosey? You're in a bar on Valentine's Day, uh!
"
5,15,141,Marshall:,"Hey, just real quick... (the girl pepper-sprays him, he writhes in pain) you wanna marry my friend Ted?
"
5,15,142,Lily:,"Man, Ted's right, it's tough out there.
"
5,15,143,Marshall:,"This is stupid. You know what, we forgot about this. I'm sure Ted did also.
"
5,15,144,Ted:,"Here comes the groom in his favorite blazer, gonna meet my wife and I'm...laser, tazer, gaze her, take, bathe her?
"
5,15,145,Robin:,"Hey, Ted?
"
5,15,146,Ted:,"Yeah?
"
5,15,147,Robin:,"Before you go meet your future wife, why don't you swing by Don's party with me?
"
5,15,148,Ted:,"That's what you're wearing?
"
5,15,149,Robin:,"Yeah, why?
"
5,15,150,Ted:,"He's a duck. That dude be straight-ducking. ""And I think that I'll amaze her"". Nailed it!
"
5,15,151,Ted:,"Look, Robin, I don't wanna crowd you on your little date here, so if things start to get hot and heavy with Don...
"
5,15,152,Robin:,"They're not gonna get...
"
5,15,153,Ted:,"I'm just saying, if they do... I'll just say ""Well, I got a dinner res"" and then, wait this is the last part, I've been working on it for a while... I'll duck out.
"
5,15,154,Robin:,"Ha ha ha. It's not gonna get happen... but yeah, do that!
"
5,15,155,Don:,"Hello, Robin. (he gets up from the couch, he's naked, except for a heart-shaped red chocolate box covering his privates)
"
5,15,156,Ted:,"Well, I got a dinner res... (Ted ducks out)
"
5,15,157,Robin:,"Come... god, Don, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,15,158,Don:,"I don't know. It's something called the Naked Man. I read about it on some guy's blog. My god, I'm so stupid, why did I ever think it would work on someone like you?
"
5,15,159,Robin:,"Yeah, cause I would never, could like, standards, so... you know... I thought this was a party.
"
5,15,160,Don:,"I only said that to get you to come over here. I didn't think you'd bring a date.
"
5,15,161,Robin:,"Ted's not my date. He's a friend.
"
5,15,162,Don:,"Oh god, you probably think I'm some kind of playboy now, right?
"
5,15,163,Robin:,"(sees Don with imaginary rabbit's ears) You could say that.
"
5,15,164,Ted:,"So he's a rabbit. At least you know for sure.
"
5,15,165,Robin:,"Ted, this may hurt a little, I'm recycling your old Architecture Weekly magazines.
"
5,15,166,Ted:,"What are you doing?
"
5,15,167,Robin:,"Cleaning. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day.
"
5,15,168,Marshall:,"Oh, thank god, you're here!
"
5,15,169,Ted:,"Yeah, I've been thinking, hmm, maybe we should call this whole thing off...
"
5,15,170,Marshall:,"No. Ted. We got her. It's, it's the craziest thing. We were searching all week and then a couple hours ago...
"
5,15,171,Marshall:,"Trudy?
"
5,15,172,Lily:,"Married.
"
5,15,173,Marshall:,"Blah Blah?
"
5,15,174,Lily:,"Committed.
"
5,15,175,Marshall:,"Relationship?
"
5,15,176,Lily:,"Bellevue.
"
5,15,177,Marshall:,"Natalie?
"
5,15,178,Lily:,"Ted's her least favorite person in the world.
"
5,15,179,Marshall:,"Well, she's not getting any younger.
"
5,15,180,Barney:,"Get rid of it. This phone is cursed. Cursed, I tell you! I tried to ignore it but it just never stops ringing. It's ruining my life! I should get that. (Marshall takes it away from him) No, please, please, please, Marshall, let me answer it, it could be an emergency, she could be trapped in a giant bra.
"
5,15,181,Ranjit:,"Barney, Barney, let it go... to voicemail. (carries him to the cab)
"
5,15,182,Barney:,"(mumbles) OK... (cries into Ranjit's shoulder)
"
5,15,183,Marshall:,"We have to find Ted a wife. We're being too choosey. It almost doesn't matter who it is at this point. (both look over at Barney's phone)
"
5,15,184,Ted:,"It's a phone girl!?
"
5,15,185,Marshall:,"I know, I know... but no, then we met her and Ted... she's a world-class violinist, she's a gourmet cook and she can quote every line from Caddy Shack.
"
5,15,186,Ted:,"Wow.
"
5,15,187,Hot Chick:,"Hello, Ted! ""And what brings you to this nape of the woods, neck of the wape? Why are you here?"" (Ted's impressed)
"
5,15,188,Marshall:,"Oh but Natalia, tell Ted the problem.
"
5,15,189,Lily:,"Yeah, yeah, tell him, tell him!
"
5,15,190,Natalia:,"Well, unfortunately I'm going to have to leave the country soon because my visa is about to expire.
"
5,15,191,Lily:,"(whispers) She needs to get married.
"
5,15,192,Marshall:,"(whispers too) Federal law expressly dictates that a foreign national can't maintain residency for longer than six months without a work visa.
"
5,15,193,Waiter:,"And you, Sir? The rabbit or the duck?
"
5,15,194,Ted:,"What?
"
5,15,195,Waiter:,"It's a pre-fixed menu for Valentine's Day and we're already out of the steak, fish and chicken. So rabbit or duck?
"
5,15,196,Ted:,"Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go. (he leaves)
"
5,15,197,Marshall:,"Why would Ted order the rabbit if he's just gonna run out?
"
5,15,198,Barney:,"I need it back. Where is the phone? Well, heeellooooo. Oh I met you already. Where is the phone?
"
5,15,199,Lily:,"It's hidden.
"
5,15,200,Barney:,"Where?
"
5,15,201,Robin:,"You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day.
"
5,15,202,Ted:,"Barney's phone... I wonder how it got in there?
"
5,15,203,Robin:,"Ted! Come on. Big date.
"
5,15,204,Ted:,"Uh what's the harm... Hello!
"
5,15,205,Ted:,"Terrific. I will see you there. And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer. Ah ah ah I think you'll know the blazer when you see it. Oooh! I gotta go.
"
5,15,206,Marshall:,"Oh, thank god, you're here.
"
5,15,207,Waiter:,"So rabbit or duck?
"
5,15,208,Ted:,"Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go.
"
5,15,209,Ted:,"Well, heeellooooo. (to a pretty girl ; phone rings) Sorry, babe, I gotta take this. Barney's phone, Teddy Westside speaking.
"
5,15,210,Barney:,"My phone. I'm taking it back. And I'm taking your cool nickname too. Barney Westside speaking.
"
5,15,211,Ted:,"No, no, I love it so much. It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. Give it, give it.
"
5,15,212,Barney:,"(picks up) Hey, baby...
"
5,15,213,Ted:,"It's mine now.
"
5,15,214,Barney:,"It's not your phone. (they fight over it)
"
5,15,215,Marshall:,"Lily. (hands her the phone). No. No! (Barney grabs his neck) Aaaargh.
"
5,15,216,Lily:,"(drops the phone into a pitcher) Oops.
"
5,15,217,Ted:,"Being single sucks. It turns you into a crazy person.
"
5,15,218,Robin:,"I know. So much running around and freaking out. For what?
"
5,15,219,Ted:,"So long as you can find someone you can sit on the couch and put off cleaning the bathroom with.
"
5,15,220,Robin:,"Well, the joke's on the rest of the world cause we can do that on our own.
"
5,15,221,Ted:,"Exactly.
"
5,15,222,Robin:,"Exactly.
"
5,15,223,Don:,"Robin, I have to apologize...
"
5,15,224,Robin:,"Save it. Let's just do the news.
"
5,15,225,Don:,"No. Listen... after you left the other night, I was embarrassed. Not because I was naked. I'm actually pretty OK with my body.
"
5,15,226,Robin:,"Clearly.
"
5,15,227,Don:,"I got married in college. I just got divorced three months ago. I have no idea how to be single. But that's not why I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed by my behavior right here at Channel...hmm, it starts with a 1, I know that, but...
"
5,15,228,Robin:,"12.
"
5,15,229,Don:,"12!...
"
5,15,230,Robin:,"You can... just look at your mug.
"
5,15,231,Don:,"Right. Well, no, you look at this mug (point to his face). You are a tremendous news anchor. And you deserve a co-anchor who gives a crap. And from here on out, it's gonna be me.
"
5,15,232,Robin:,"Well, I'll believe that when I see it.
"
5,15,233,Don:,"Well, you'll see it right now. I'll go get you some coffee.
"
5,15,234,Robin:,"Don!! You're wearing pants!
"
5,15,235,Don:,"Well, look at that!
"
5,15,236,Robin:,"(sees him with an imaginary duck's beak) Uh, duck!
"
5,1,1,2009:,"IN. TED'S CLASSROOM
"
5,1,2,Ted (2030):,"Kids, on my first day as a college professor, there were two things I didn't know that I wish did. The first thing was that your mother was in that classroom.
"
5,1,3,Ted (2030):,"The second thing? Well, to explain that we have to go back to the beginning of the summer.
"
5,1,4,Ted (2030):,"When, after a year of wrestling with their feelings for each other, Barney and Robin finally, well...
"
5,1,5,Lily:,"Whoo!!!
"
5,1,6,Robin:,"Lily! All we need is your indoor ""whoo.""
"
5,1,7,Lily:,"Sorry. (slower) Whoo! It's just they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! Oh I love this!
"
5,1,8,Barney:,"Yeah, Lily, listen.
"
5,1,9,Robin:,"Barney's awesome.
"
5,1,10,Barney:,"Robin's more than just awe-""some."" She's awe-""quite a bit."" She's awe-""a whole darn lot.""
"
5,1,11,Lily:,"Wait, what are you saying?
"
5,1,12,Robin:,"We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.
"
5,1,13,Barney:,"Oh yeah.
"
5,1,14,Lily:,"Is it something I did?
"
5,1,15,Robin:,"Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us.
"
5,1,16,Barney:,"Yeah, It's us. You understand, right?
"
5,1,17,Lily:,"Sure, of course. As long as you're happy, I'm happy.
"
5,1,18,Lily:,"We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips.
"
5,1,19,Marshall:,"(trying to console her) I know. I Know. So... has the boat sailed on s*x tonight or...
"
5,1,20,Ted (2030):,"After that, the summer went by way too fast. Until all of a sudden, it was the Friday before my first day as a college professor.
"
5,1,21,Ted:,"Wow! What's this?
"
5,1,22,Marshall:,"It's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favourite professor of all time.
"
5,1,23,Ted:,"A fedora! (he puts it on his head and pulls out a whip) I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!
"
5,1,24,Barney:,"That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy.
"
5,1,25,Ted:,"You know what we should do? We should...
"
5,1,26,Marshall:,"Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff.
"
5,1,27,Ted:,"God... you just get me.
"
5,1,28,Robin:,"OK, I should get going. I got a date.
"
5,1,29,Barney:,"You're still seeing that guy?
"
5,1,30,Robin:,"Even better, seeing him naked.
"
5,1,31,Robin and Barney:,"(striking their fist) What!
"
5,1,32,Barney:,"I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds.
"
5,1,33,Marshall:,"OK Ted, You got first whip!
"
5,1,34,Ted:,"All right. (imitating Clint Eastwood) Hey, dummy (to a mannequin). What did tell you about smoking in here?
"
5,1,35,Marshall:,"Make him whip the habit! I'so excited about this whip! I got whip fever! Just whip him, Ted! Don't even aim! Just whip him!
"
5,1,36,Ted:,"I'm so sorry.
"
5,1,37,Marshall:,"It's just the whip's not a toy. There's such a thing as common sense, you know.
"
5,1,38,Ted:,"You can whip me if you want.
"
5,1,39,Marshall:,"I will, some other time.
"
5,1,40,Lily:,"Whoo!!!!!!
"
5,1,41,Lily:,"So, how long has this been going on?
"
5,1,42,Barney:,"All summer.
"
5,1,43,Lily:,"I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.
"
5,1,44,Barney and Robin:,"Wow, wow...
"
5,1,45,Barney:,"Girlfriend?
"
5,1,46,Robin:,"Slow your roll there, Lilypad.
"
5,1,47,Barney:,"Yeah, yeah.
"
5,1,48,Lily:,"You've been together all summer. I don't get it.
"
5,1,49,Robin:,"Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.
"
5,1,50,Robin:,"We should figure out what this is.
"
5,1,51,Barney:,"Yes, we should. Or. Or...
"
5,1,52,And after having s*x:,"
"
5,1,53,Robin:,"Okay, now, we have to figure this out.
"
5,1,54,Barney:,"Yes, we do. Or. Or...
"
5,1,55,Robin:,"We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.
"
5,1,56,Barney:,"Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, ""I don't know.
"
5,1,57,Lily:,"You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.
"
5,1,58,Robin:,"Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.
"
5,1,59,Barney:,"Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.
"
5,1,60,Lily:,"No, no, no (trying to hold Barney who tries to kiss Robin). You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.
"
5,1,61,Barney:,"Or. Or...
"
5,1,62,Ted:,"I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?"" I know the board says ""Professor Mosby,"" but to you I'm Ted.
"
5,1,63,Ted:,"Question. Awesome. Hit it.
"
5,1,64,Blond Girl:,"Yeah, here's my question, ""Ted,"" who the hell do you think you are?
"
5,1,65,A boy:,"Yeah Ted, we're supposed to learn from you? You failed as an architect.
"
5,1,66,Another boy:,"And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip?
"
5,1,67,Ted:,"They're at home. I...
"
5,1,68,Another girl:,"And where are your pants?
"
5,1,69,Ted:,"Oh, God.
"
5,1,70,Ted:,"Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...
"
5,1,71,Barney:,"Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?
"
5,1,72,Ted:,"I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.
"
5,1,73,Barney:,"Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.
"
5,1,74,Marshall:,"Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.
"
5,1,75,Lily:,"I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.
"
5,1,76,Barney:,"Exactly.
"
5,1,77,Lily:,"If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.
"
5,1,78,Barney:,"Amen.
"
5,1,79,Lily:,"You have to make things clear.
"
5,1,80,Barney:,"Run tell that.
"
5,1,81,Lily:,"Define the relationship.
"
5,1,82,Barney:,"Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.
"
5,1,83,Barney:,"Lily, can't you just let us be happy?
"
5,1,84,Lily:,"You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.
"
5,1,85,Barney:,"And that's not happy?
"
5,1,86,Lily:,"Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.
"
5,1,87,Barney:,"Why? Give me one good reason.
"
5,1,88,Lily:,"I'll give you 20...
"
5,1,89,Barney:,"Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.
"
5,1,90,Brad:,"(to Robin) I've got two tickets to the Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking...
"
5,1,91,Robin:,"Euh, oh, hum, heu...
"
5,1,92,Brad:,"What do I have to do? Put a gun to your head? Buy you a six pack?
"
5,1,93,Robin:,"Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.
"
5,1,94,Brad:,"Why not? You have a boyfriend?
"
5,1,95,Robin:,"No. No, no boyfriend.
"
5,1,96,Brad:,"Great! It's a date.
"
5,1,97,Brad:,"Hey Barn!
"
5,1,98,Barney:,"Hey Brad.
"
5,1,99,Lily:,"I just thought of a reason.
"
5,1,100,Ted (2030):,"The next night, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game.
"
5,1,101,Robin:,"You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.
"
5,1,102,Robin:,"Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!
"
5,1,103,Brad:,"Not really.
"
5,1,104,Robin:,"The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.
"
5,1,105,Brad:,"Oh, man. Is this the talk?
"
5,1,106,Robin:,"What?
"
5,1,107,Brad:,"No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious.
"
5,1,108,Robin:,"No, Brad, no, it's...
"
5,1,109,Brad:,"But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different.
"
5,1,110,Robin:,"God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.
"
5,1,111,Brad:,"You and Barn... oh, so you guys are...
"
5,1,112,Robin:,"Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says ""leap into it."" My brain says ""it's a bad idea.""
"
5,1,113,Brad:,"Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.
"
5,1,114,Barney:,"We're not gonna have the talk.
"
5,1,115,Marshall:,"Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have s*x afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.
"
5,1,116,Ted:,"I don't think the talk is necessary.
"
5,1,117,Marshall:,"What?!
"
5,1,118,Barney:,"Thank you, Ted.
"
5,1,119,Ted:,"Because Robin is already his girlfriend.
"
5,1,120,Barney:,"What?!
"
5,1,121,Ted:,"MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...
"
5,1,122,Barney:,"How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.
"
5,1,123,Ted:,"""Gremlins""?
"
5,1,124,Barney:,"Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them
"
5,1,125,Ted:,"What about brunch? Is brunch cool?
"
5,1,126,Barney:,"No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.
"
5,1,127,Ted:,"OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?
"
5,1,128,Barney:,"Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...
"
5,1,129,Barney:,"I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?
"
5,1,130,Marshall:,"Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.
"
5,1,131,Voice:,"Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!
"
5,1,132,Brad:,"Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney.
"
5,1,133,Robin:,"Why not? Lay it on me.
"
5,1,134,Barney:,"Hey Brad!
"
5,1,135,Barney:,"Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!
"
5,1,136,Brad:,"It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.
"
5,1,137,Barney:,"Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.
"
5,1,138,Robin:,"That's putting it a bit strongly.
"
5,1,139,Barney:,"A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.
"
5,1,140,Robin:,"A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?
"
5,1,141,Lily:,"Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?
"
5,1,142,Barney:,"Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.
"
5,1,143,Ted (2030 ):,"Finally, my first class had arrived. For real this time. I knew I had to make
"
5,1,144,Ted:,"(for himself) Wait. Does professor have one ""F"" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two ""F's"". That looks right. I think that's right.
"
5,1,145,Barney:,"Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.
"
5,1,146,Robin:,"We've been over this. Unless I say ""flugelhorn"" you haven't gone too far.
"
5,1,147,Barney:,"No, I meant punching Brad.
"
5,1,148,Robin:,"Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...
"
5,1,149,Robin:,"God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?
"
5,1,150,Barney:,"No.
"
5,1,151,Robin:,"Flugelhorn. Did you do this?
"
5,1,152,Robin:,"(knocking at the door) Ted, are you out there?
"
5,1,153,Lily:,"(sitting behind the door) Ted's not here, Robin.
"
5,1,154,Robin:,"Lily, let us out of here.
"
5,1,155,Lily:,"I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.
"
5,1,156,Robin:,"Lily! Come on. Let us out!
"
5,1,157,Lily:,"No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.
"
5,1,158,Barney:,"We are not having the talk!
"
5,1,159,Lily:,"Then you'll die in there.
"
5,1,160,Robin:,"You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having s*x!
"
5,1,161,Lily:,"Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.
"
5,1,162,Marshall:,"Hey, guys.
"
5,1,163,Ted (2030):,"I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times.
"
5,1,164,Ted:,"Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.
"
5,1,165,Barney:,"Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here (showing girl's boobs). Okay, good luck. Byesies.
"
5,1,166,Ted (2030):,"This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be. I had to decide.
"
5,1,167,Ted:,"Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...
"
5,1,168,Ted (2030):,"Professor Mosby had arrived. Of course, if I had taken
"
5,1,169,Blond girl:,"I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby, but this isn't Architecture 101. This is Economics 305. You're in the wrong classroom.
"
5,1,170,Ted (2030):,"Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.
"
5,1,171,Ted:,"Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.
"
5,1,172,A girl:,"Architect?
"
5,1,173,Marshall:,"(reading): We're just hanging out.""
"
5,1,174,Lily:,"Just hanging out? Not good enough.
"
5,1,175,Marshall:,"(whipping with the whip) Not good enough!
"
5,1,176,Ted:,"Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?
"
5,1,177,A boy:,"Economics?
"
5,1,178,Ted:,"Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.
"
5,1,179,Marshall:,"(reading the new note slipped by Robin) ""We're seeing where things are going.""
"
5,1,180,Lily:,"I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.
"
5,1,181,Marshall:,"(whipping) Not good enough!
"
5,1,182,Ted:,"(to a student) You... Why do you want to be an architect?
"
5,1,183,Student:,"I don't want to be an architect.
"
5,1,184,Ted:,"Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.
"
5,1,185,Ted:,"No questions!
"
5,1,186,Marshall:,"(reading the new note) ""We're Barnman and Robin."" (he laughs) Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.
"
5,1,187,Lily:,"Not... good enough.
"
5,1,188,Marshall:,"(whipping) Not good enough!
"
5,1,189,Ted:,"So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.
"
5,1,190,Ted:,"Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!
"
5,1,191,Other professor:,"(coming into the classroom) Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats.
"
5,1,192,Ted:,"Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?
"
5,1,193,Professor:,"Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7.
"
5,1,194,Ted:,"Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.
"
5,1,195,Student:,"T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro.
"
5,1,196,Ted:,"Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.
"
5,1,197,Lily:,"20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.
"
5,1,198,Ted:,"Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.
"
5,1,199,Lily:,"That's awesome, Ted.
"
5,1,200,Marshall:,"Congratulations, buddy.
"
5,1,201,Ted:,"Thanks.
"
5,1,202,Robin:,"(from her room) Nice job, Ted.
"
5,1,203,Barney:,"(from Robin's room) Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?
"
5,1,204,Ted:,"(to Barney) Yeah, I got you, buddy. (to Marshall and Lily) They still haven't had the talk?
"
5,1,205,Marshall:,"I think I know how to speed things up
"
5,1,206,Robin:,"Not cool!
"
5,1,207,Marshall:,"Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.
"
5,1,208,Robin:,"(to Barney) Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.
"
5,1,209,Barney:,"Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?
"
5,1,210,Robin:,"(reading) Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.
"
5,1,211,Barney:,"I know, right?
"
5,1,212,Robin:,"Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?
"
5,1,213,Barney:,"I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend
"
5,1,214,Robin:,"Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a cliché, but... he really ruined me for other men.
"
5,1,215,Ted (2030):,"Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine
"
5,1,216,Barney:,"Maybe we should go back to being just friends.
"
5,1,217,Robin:,"Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.
"
5,1,218,Barney:,"Good. Me, neither.
"
5,1,219,Robin:,"Friends isn't gonna work.
"
5,1,220,Barney:,"We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?
"
5,1,221,Robin:,"I know something we're good at.
"
5,1,222,Barney:,"I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...
"
5,1,223,Robin:,"No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?
"
5,1,224,Lily:,"Really?
"
5,1,225,Robin:,"Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.
"
5,1,226,Barney:,"And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.
"
5,1,227,Robin:,"We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.
"
5,1,228,Barney:,"And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.
"
5,1,229,Robin:,"And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.
"
5,1,230,Barney:,"She can handle her Scotch.
"
5,1,231,Robin:," He's my boyfriend.
"
5,1,232,Barney:,"And she's my girlfriend.
"
5,1,233,Marshall:,"(whipping) Good enough!
"
5,1,234,Robin:,"(leaving the building) She bought it.
"
5,1,235,Barney:,"Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.
"
5,1,236,Robin:,"Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?
"
5,1,237,Barney:,"You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.
"
5,1,238,Robin:,"Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.
"
5,1,239,Barney:,"Flugelhorn?
"
5,1,240,Robin:," Yeah, that felt wrong.
"
5,1,241,Ted:,"You do realize they were lying, right?
"
5,1,242,Lily:,"No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying.
"
5,1,243,Marshall:,"Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.
"
5,1,244,Marshall:,"What? Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night? Doesn't feel very good, does it?
"
5,1,245,Lily:,"So, how long has this been going on?
"
5,1,246,Barney:,"All summer.
"
5,1,247,Lily:,"I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.
"
5,1,248,Barney and Robin:,"Wow, wow...
"
5,1,249,Barney:,"Girlfriend?
"
5,1,250,Robin:,"Slow your roll there, Lilypad.
"
5,1,251,Barney:,"Yeah, yeah.
"
5,1,252,Lily:,"You've been together all summer. I don't get it.
"
5,1,253,Robin:,"Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.
"
5,1,254,Robin:,"We should figure out what this is.
"
5,1,255,Barney:,"Yes, we should. Or. Or...
"
5,1,256,And after having s*x:,"
"
5,1,257,Robin:,"Okay, now, we have to figure this out.
"
5,1,258,Barney:,"Yes, we do. Or. Or...
"
5,1,259,Robin:,"We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.
"
5,1,260,Barney:,"Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, ""I don't know.
"
5,1,261,Lily:,"You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.
"
5,1,262,Robin:,"Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.
"
5,1,263,Barney:,"Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.
"
5,1,264,Lily:,"No, no, no (trying to hold Barney who tries to kiss Robin). You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.
"
5,1,265,Barney:,"Or. Or...
"
5,1,266,Ted:,"I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?"" I know the board says ""Professor Mosby,"" but to you I'm Ted.
"
5,1,267,Ted:,"Question. Awesome. Hit it.
"
5,1,268,Blond Girl:,"Yeah, here's my question, ""Ted,"" who the hell do you think you are?
"
5,1,269,A boy:,"Yeah Ted, we're supposed to learn from you? You failed as an architect.
"
5,1,270,Another boy:,"And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip?
"
5,1,271,Ted:,"They're at home. I...
"
5,1,272,Another girl:,"And where are your pants?
"
5,1,273,Ted:,"Oh, God.
"
5,1,274,Ted:,"Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...
"
5,1,275,Barney:,"Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?
"
5,1,276,Ted:,"I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.
"
5,1,277,Barney:,"Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.
"
5,1,278,Marshall:,"Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.
"
5,1,279,Lily:,"I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.
"
5,1,280,Barney:,"Exactly.
"
5,1,281,Lily:,"If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.
"
5,1,282,Barney:,"Amen.
"
5,1,283,Lily:,"You have to make things clear.
"
5,1,284,Barney:,"Run tell that.
"
5,1,285,Lily:,"Define the relationship.
"
5,1,286,Barney:,"Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.
"
5,1,287,Barney:,"Lily, can't you just let us be happy?
"
5,1,288,Lily:,"You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.
"
5,1,289,Barney:,"And that's not happy?
"
5,1,290,Lily:,"Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.
"
5,1,291,Barney:,"Why? Give me one good reason.
"
5,1,292,Lily:,"I'll give you 20...
"
5,1,293,Barney:,"Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.
"
5,1,294,Brad:,"(to Robin) I've got two tickets to the Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking...
"
5,1,295,Robin:,"Euh, oh, hum, heu...
"
5,1,296,Brad:,"What do I have to do? Put a gun to your head? Buy you a six pack?
"
5,1,297,Robin:,"Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.
"
5,1,298,Brad:,"Why not? You have a boyfriend?
"
5,1,299,Robin:,"No. No, no boyfriend.
"
5,1,300,Brad:,"Great! It's a date.
"
5,1,301,Brad:,"Hey Barn!
"
5,1,302,Barney:,"Hey Brad.
"
5,1,303,Lily:,"I just thought of a reason.
"
5,1,304,Ted (2030):,"The next night, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game.
"
5,1,305,Robin:,"You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.
"
5,1,306,Robin:,"Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!
"
5,1,307,Brad:,"Not really.
"
5,1,308,Robin:,"The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.
"
5,1,309,Brad:,"Oh, man. Is this the talk?
"
5,1,310,Robin:,"What?
"
5,1,311,Brad:,"No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious.
"
5,1,312,Robin:,"No, Brad, no, it's...
"
5,1,313,Brad:,"But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different.
"
5,1,314,Robin:,"God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.
"
5,1,315,Brad:,"You and Barn... oh, so you guys are...
"
5,1,316,Robin:,"Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says ""leap into it."" My brain says ""it's a bad idea.""
"
5,1,317,Brad:,"Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.
"
5,1,318,Barney:,"We're not gonna have the talk.
"
5,1,319,Marshall:,"Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have s*x afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.
"
5,1,320,Ted:,"I don't think the talk is necessary.
"
5,1,321,Marshall:,"What?!
"
5,1,322,Barney:,"Thank you, Ted.
"
5,1,323,Ted:,"Because Robin is already his girlfriend.
"
5,1,324,Barney:,"What?!
"
5,1,325,Ted:,"MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...
"
5,1,326,Barney:,"How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.
"
5,1,327,Ted:,"""Gremlins""?
"
5,1,328,Barney:,"Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them
"
5,1,329,Ted:,"What about brunch? Is brunch cool?
"
5,1,330,Barney:,"No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.
"
5,1,331,Ted:,"OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?
"
5,1,332,Barney:,"Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...
"
5,1,333,Barney:,"I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?
"
5,1,334,Marshall:,"Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.
"
5,1,335,Voice:,"Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!
"
5,1,336,Brad:,"Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney.
"
5,1,337,Robin:,"Why not? Lay it on me.
"
5,1,338,Barney:,"Hey Brad!
"
5,1,339,Barney:,"Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!
"
5,1,340,Brad:,"It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.
"
5,1,341,Barney:,"Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.
"
5,1,342,Robin:,"That's putting it a bit strongly.
"
5,1,343,Barney:,"A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.
"
5,1,344,Robin:,"A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?
"
5,1,345,Lily:,"Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?
"
5,1,346,Barney:,"Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.
"
5,1,347,Ted (2030 ):,"Finally, my first class had arrived. For real this time. I knew I had to make
"
5,1,348,Ted:,"(for himself) Wait. Does professor have one ""F"" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two ""F's"". That looks right. I think that's right.
"
5,1,349,Barney:,"Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.
"
5,1,350,Robin:,"We've been over this. Unless I say ""flugelhorn"" you haven't gone too far.
"
5,1,351,Barney:,"No, I meant punching Brad.
"
5,1,352,Robin:,"Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...
"
5,1,353,Robin:,"God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?
"
5,1,354,Barney:,"No.
"
5,1,355,Robin:,"Flugelhorn. Did you do this?
"
5,1,356,Robin:,"(knocking at the door) Ted, are you out there?
"
5,1,357,Lily:,"(sitting behind the door) Ted's not here, Robin.
"
5,1,358,Robin:,"Lily, let us out of here.
"
5,1,359,Lily:,"I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.
"
5,1,360,Robin:,"Lily! Come on. Let us out!
"
5,1,361,Lily:,"No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.
"
5,1,362,Barney:,"We are not having the talk!
"
5,1,363,Lily:,"Then you'll die in there.
"
5,1,364,Robin:,"You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having s*x!
"
5,1,365,Lily:,"Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.
"
5,1,366,Marshall:,"Hey, guys.
"
5,1,367,Ted (2030):,"I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times.
"
5,1,368,Ted:,"Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.
"
5,1,369,Barney:,"Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here (showing girl's boobs). Okay, good luck. Byesies.
"
5,1,370,Ted (2030):,"This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be. I had to decide.
"
5,1,371,Ted:,"Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...
"
5,1,372,Ted (2030):,"Professor Mosby had arrived. Of course, if I had taken
"
5,1,373,Blond girl:,"I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby, but this isn't Architecture 101. This is Economics 305. You're in the wrong classroom.
"
5,1,374,Ted (2030):,"Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.
"
5,1,375,Ted:,"Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.
"
5,1,376,A girl:,"Architect?
"
5,1,377,Marshall:,"(reading): We're just hanging out.""
"
5,1,378,Lily:,"Just hanging out? Not good enough.
"
5,1,379,Marshall:,"(whipping with the whip) Not good enough!
"
5,1,380,Ted:,"Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?
"
5,1,381,A boy:,"Economics?
"
5,1,382,Ted:,"Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.
"
5,1,383,Marshall:,"(reading the new note slipped by Robin) ""We're seeing where things are going.""
"
5,1,384,Lily:,"I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.
"
5,1,385,Marshall:,"(whipping) Not good enough!
"
5,1,386,Ted:,"(to a student) You... Why do you want to be an architect?
"
5,1,387,Student:,"I don't want to be an architect.
"
5,1,388,Ted:,"Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.
"
5,1,389,Ted:,"No questions!
"
5,1,390,Marshall:,"(reading the new note) ""We're Barnman and Robin."" (he laughs) Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.
"
5,1,391,Lily:,"Not... good enough.
"
5,1,392,Marshall:,"(whipping) Not good enough!
"
5,1,393,Ted:,"So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.
"
5,1,394,Ted:,"Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!
"
5,1,395,Other professor:,"(coming into the classroom) Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats.
"
5,1,396,Ted:,"Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?
"
5,1,397,Professor:,"Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7.
"
5,1,398,Ted:,"Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.
"
5,1,399,Student:,"T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro.
"
5,1,400,Ted:,"Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.
"
5,1,401,Lily:,"20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.
"
5,1,402,Ted:,"Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.
"
5,1,403,Lily:,"That's awesome, Ted.
"
5,1,404,Marshall:,"Congratulations, buddy.
"
5,1,405,Ted:,"Thanks.
"
5,1,406,Robin:,"(from her room) Nice job, Ted.
"
5,1,407,Barney:,"(from Robin's room) Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?
"
5,1,408,Ted:,"(to Barney) Yeah, I got you, buddy. (to Marshall and Lily) They still haven't had the talk?
"
5,1,409,Marshall:,"I think I know how to speed things up
"
5,1,410,Robin:,"Not cool!
"
5,1,411,Marshall:,"Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.
"
5,1,412,Robin:,"(to Barney) Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.
"
5,1,413,Barney:,"Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?
"
5,1,414,Robin:,"(reading) Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.
"
5,1,415,Barney:,"I know, right?
"
5,1,416,Robin:,"Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?
"
5,1,417,Barney:,"I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend
"
5,1,418,Robin:,"Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a cliché, but... he really ruined me for other men.
"
5,1,419,Ted (2030):,"Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine
"
5,1,420,Barney:,"Maybe we should go back to being just friends.
"
5,1,421,Robin:,"Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.
"
5,1,422,Barney:,"Good. Me, neither.
"
5,1,423,Robin:,"Friends isn't gonna work.
"
5,1,424,Barney:,"We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?
"
5,1,425,Robin:,"I know something we're good at.
"
5,1,426,Barney:,"I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...
"
5,1,427,Robin:,"No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?
"
5,1,428,Lily:,"Really?
"
5,1,429,Robin:,"Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.
"
5,1,430,Barney:,"And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.
"
5,1,431,Robin:,"We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.
"
5,1,432,Barney:,"And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.
"
5,1,433,Robin:,"And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.
"
5,1,434,Barney:,"She can handle her Scotch.
"
5,1,435,Robin:," He's my boyfriend.
"
5,1,436,Barney:,"And she's my girlfriend.
"
5,1,437,Marshall:,"(whipping) Good enough!
"
5,1,438,Robin:,"(leaving the building) She bought it.
"
5,1,439,Barney:,"Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.
"
5,1,440,Robin:,"Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?
"
5,1,441,Barney:,"You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.
"
5,1,442,Robin:,"Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.
"
5,1,443,Barney:,"Flugelhorn?
"
5,1,444,Robin:," Yeah, that felt wrong.
"
5,1,445,Ted:,"You do realize they were lying, right?
"
5,1,446,Lily:,"No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying.
"
5,1,447,Marshall:,"Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.
"
5,1,448,Marshall:,"What? Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night? Doesn't feel very good, does it?
"
5,14,1,Ted (2030):,"There are ways to relieve stress.
"
5,14,2,Woman:,"You'll have a few minutes, Mr. Stinson.
"
5,14,3,Ted (2030):,"Many people bite their nails. Others tap their feet.And others imagine themselves to be interviewed by renowned sports commentator Jim Nantz.
"
5,14,4,Jim:,"Hi friends, any sport has had its icon, which it excels. Ali was boxing, basketball had Jordan, and the sport of sleeping with bombs snuff chance, my next guest, Mr Barney Stinson.Barney, welcome.
"
5,14,5,Barney:,"Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show.
"
5,14,6,Jim:,"It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history.
"
5,14,7,Barney:,"Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary.
"
5,14,8,Barney:,"It all started when I decided to start a small challenge.
"
5,14,9,Marshall:,"Oh my God. Wow.
"
5,14,10,Ted:,"He decides his victim.
"
5,14,11,Barney:,"Whatever the girl I'm trying to point is that I go with her tonight. And... they're off!
"
5,14,12,Marshall:,"Hi!
"
5,14,13,Robin:,"Hi!
"
5,14,14,Lily:,"How did it go with Dale?
"
5,14,15,Robin:,"You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel.
"
5,14,16,Lily:,"Robin, this is not because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character for your first date it can not be your future.
"
5,14,17,Marshall:,"The Yeti is not fictitious.
"
5,14,18,"Ted, from seeing Barney:","That was fast.
"
5,14,19,Jim:,"So, the first night was pretty normal.
"
5,14,20,Barney:,"Jim, there is nothing in my usual way to pack.
"
5,14,21,Jim:,"Respect. Which brings us to the second night.
"
5,14,22,Barney:,"That brings us to the second night. You see the bomb that pampers its Black Russian (Vodka and coffee liqueur)? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me.
"
5,14,23,Robin:,"Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her?
"
5,14,24,Marshall:,"How do you know he'll call?
"
5,14,25,Robin:,"How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.
"
5,14,26,Ted:,"And well, do not push too. People can be fragile. And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.
"
5,14,27,Lily:,"How it happened at school today, Ted?
"
5,14,28,Ted:,"Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester...
"
5,14,29,Ted:,"Jamie Adamic. Salvation. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz?Salvation. Well done. Add a false name on the call sheet, very original guys. You know, I expected a little maturity, coming from students like you, and frankly, more creative. I mean, seriously, what kind of fake name is Jen Coulin?
"
5,14,30,Student:,"Present.
"
5,14,31,Ted:,"Come on guys, you would have at least been able to make it sound right. Jen Coulin?
"
5,14,32,Student:,"Present.
"
5,14,33,Ted:,"What happened to classic? Sat Troulcu, Ted and Bill Oukoi, Maby Stoukette, Roland Cule, that's false names, but Jen Coulin?
"
5,14,34,Student:,"Here.
"
5,14,35,Ted:,"Jen Coulin!
"
5,14,36,Student:,"It's just there.
"
5,14,37,Ted:,"Come on, I wait, swing all your jokes about Jen Coulin.
"
5,14,38,Lily:,"We will not make jokes, Ted. I mean, this girl must really be in the hole.
"
5,14,39,Marshall:,"You really soiled the name of Jen Coulin.
"
5,14,40,Ted:,"Have you finished?
"
5,14,41,Robin:,"You asked him if she had reached the right exit?
"
5,14,42,Lily:,"Wow, two in a row, Barney is thoroughly.
"
5,14,43,Robin:,"This is a lucky girl, Barney was my best shot.
"
5,14,44,Ted:,"And this is the best friend I ever had.
"
5,14,45,Lily:,"It is everything I love that Marshall either.
"
5,14,46,Marshall:,"It's all I want to be.
"
5,14,47,Barney:,"I guess that's just what they said when I was gone.
"
5,14,48,Jim:,"I believe it. You are awesome. Now, night 3. Describe it to us.
"
5,14,49,Barney:,"Jim, I can tell you that I was gone, so I wanted a little spice.
"
5,14,50,Barney:,"I think I'll take small tits tonight.
"
5,14,51,Lily:,"You're yucky.
"
5,14,52,Barney:,"Lily, it's people too.
"
5,14,53,Wendy:,"That's your burgers.
"
5,14,54,Marshall:,"thank you.
"
5,14,55,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
5,14,56,Ted:,"You share it? Your share forever.
"
5,14,57,Lily:,"Of course not!
"
5,14,58,Marshall:,"There is no such Bizarros who share everything.
"
5,14,59,Robin:,"Of course I do.
"
5,14,60,Ted:,"That's exactly what you are.
"
5,14,61,Lily:,"It is perfectly normal.
"
5,14,62,Robin:,"What's happening guys?
"
5,14,63,Marshall:,"You know, Lily and I was looking for a new couple of friends since we lost Robin and Barney, and Ted and Stella and Ted and Robin, and Ted... Ted and Victoria, when do you arrive to keep one?
"
5,14,64,Ted:,"How we came up with that?
"
5,14,65,Lily:,"It was a great day out at 4 it was cool, we were relaxed, it was not freaked out.
"
5,14,66,Marshall:,"And there, a tiny detail has surfaced, and it ruined the whole evening.
"
5,14,67,Man:,".. and the toothbrush Joanna is ejected from the sink, facing the ceiling, and falls straight down the toilet.
"
5,14,68,Marshall:,"It's crazy that last week, it happened the same with our toothbrushes.
"
5,14,69,Woman:,"Our toothbrush?
"
5,14,70,Ted:,"Our toothbrush?
"
5,14,71,Jim:,"Our toothbrush?
"
5,14,72,Lily:,"Yeah.
"
5,14,73,Male:,"As in, a toothbrush?
"
5,14,74,Robin:,"As in, a toothbrush? You use both?
"
5,14,75,Jim:,"Every day?
"
5,14,76,Lily:,"That's weird?
"
5,14,77,Ted:,"Marshall, 4 of 5 dentists have just vomited on.
"
5,14,78,Robin:,"Hey, look, Barney has yet fallen one.
"
5,14,79,Lily:,"Wow. 3 girls in 3 nights. This is gross, even from Barney.
"
5,14,80,Ted:,"Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do...
"
5,14,81,Marshall:,"Do not tell! You're going to jinx him!
"
5,14,82,Lily:,"Wear what bad luck?
"
5,14,83,Barney:,"I had left to do... flawless.
"
5,14,84,Barney:,"It was faultless. 7 nights, 7 girls, 0 rejection.
"
5,14,85,Jim:,"Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder.
"
5,14,86,Barney:,"Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896.
"
5,14,87,Jim:,"It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield...
"
5,14,88,Barney:,"You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door.
"
5,14,89,Jim:,".. takes you straight into the wall. And sometimes you spread yourself. And it almost always ends badly. But this week, you were to 3 of 3, and no sign of abating.
"
5,14,90,Barney:,"I can even say, without a fault. I'd love to say the same of my friends.
"
5,14,91,Ted:,"Jen has not come into being today.
"
5,14,92,Marshall:,"Excuse me, Jen?
"
5,14,93,Robin:,"Yeah, Ted, we know tons of people who call Jen.
"
5,14,94,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
5,14,95,Ted:,"Jen Coulin.
"
5,14,96,Robin:,"Oh, you're there. The dreaded call from Dale. Oh, that's my mother. She has big health problems. But why does he not call?
"
5,14,97,Lily:,"Wait a second. Want it called?
"
5,14,98,Robin:,"No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that?
"
5,14,99,Ted:,"Yeah. When did you start doing that too?
"
5,14,100,Marshall:,"It's been years! You had to know, you lived with us.
"
5,14,101,Ted:,"Yeah, but you always keep your toothbrush in the bathroom, which is, incidentally, also weird.
"
5,14,102,Lily:,"We kept her in the bathroom.
"
5,14,103,Ted:,"No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine.
"
5,14,104,Robin:,"Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3?
"
5,14,105,Marshall:,"Oh my god!
"
5,14,106,Ted:,"Finish me!
"
5,14,107,Robin:,"I'm having so much!
"
5,14,108,Jim:,"So you're at four, he'll just make a 5 to 7.
"
5,14,109,Barney:,"Well done, Jim.
"
5,14,110,Jim:,"Hey, I try. I'm not you. It was then comes the night No 5, and trouble with.
"
5,14,111,Ted:,"Beer! Salvation.
"
5,14,112,Marshall:,"Hi. How is Barney?
"
5,14,113,Ted:,"Like a charm. As all week.
"
5,14,114,Marshall:,"Yeah? Hard to believe.
"
5,14,115,Ted:,"Why?
"
5,14,116,Marshall:,"Apparently, this big merger last week went wrong, and Barney wears the hat.
"
5,14,117,Lily:,"Oh, it's weird. He said nothing.
"
5,14,118,Marshall:,"Even I who works with him, I just learned this afternoon when I walked past the office of his boss.
"
5,14,119,Pattern:,".. what it has cost this company, Stinson?!
"
5,14,120,Marshall:,"I never thought about Barney so scared.
"
5,14,121,Marshall:,"I think he'll get fired.
"
5,14,122,Ted:,"I can not believe that Barney is going to get fired.
"
5,14,123,Marshall:,"Yeah, they have a meeting Friday to see if he keeps his job or not.
"
5,14,124,Robin:,"Poor guy. It must pinball.
"
5,14,125,Lily:,"I'll go talk to him.
"
5,14,126,Ted:,"No! You can not distract a man who is right... you know what.
"
5,14,127,Lily:,"Come on, it's his career. This is much more important than a stupid without...
"
5,14,128,Marshall:,"Ahh! Okay. You can lick my hand all you want, I will not let you ruin... Ouch!
"
5,14,129,Lily:,"It must go talk to him.
"
5,14,130,Ted:,"I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy.
"
5,14,131,Barney:,"Hey!
"
5,14,132,Ted:,"Is everything okay?
"
5,14,133,Barney:,"Absolutely. A background. It could not get better. I make fun of that? I need you.
"
5,14,134,Ted:,"Anything you want. What's the matter?
"
5,14,135,Barney:,"Which of these girls look the most stupid?
"
5,14,136,Ted:,"Let's see it. Already heated to perfection? The smashed out? Ok I will deal for Big Mac.
"
5,14,137,Barney:,"Thank you, Skip.
"
5,14,138,Lily:,"So what did he say?
"
5,14,139,Ted:,"What? Oh, it will try with the girl holding the burger there.
"
5,14,140,Lily:,"You were supposed to talk about his loss of job.
"
5,14,141,Ted:,"Lily, why is that force him to face a problem that can not adjust will help?
"
5,14,142,Lily:,"And why ignore it will fix things?
"
5,14,143,Ted:,"You're much ignored the problems of dental hygiene for a dozen years. And yet you seem to...
"
5,14,144,Lily:,"Jen Coulin!
"
5,14,145,Robin:,"Jen Coulin.
"
5,14,146,Ted:,"Dale you called?
"
5,14,147,Robin:,"Why do you...
"
5,14,148,Marshall:,"Guys, guys, look!
"
5,14,149,Jim:,"Barney, I will interrupt you one second, I must ask you something. Have you ever taken Viagra?
"
5,14,150,Barney:,"No, sir. I like to play by the rules. While I can not say I did not propose to.
"
5,14,151,Marshall:,"It was pretty awesome. You should try it. I still have a few.
"
5,14,152,Barney:,"No thank you.
"
5,14,153,Marshall:,"You sure? Ok, do as you like. What time is it?
"
5,14,154,Barney:,"It's 8:00.
"
5,14,155,Marshall:,"8:00? I have to go to hospital.
"
5,14,156,Barney:,"I've never touched. I can pee in a jar if you like, Jim Nantz.
"
5,14,157,Jim:,"Barney, I trust you. I miss you even ask the question. Let's talk about the night 6. Two girls prepared to perfection.
"
5,14,158,Ted:,".. seriously guys.
"
5,14,159,Marshall:,"Hey!
"
5,14,160,Ted:,"Hey, what are you doing here? Returns to the bar!
"
5,14,161,Barney:,"Ted, relax. I am already 6 of 6.
"
5,14,162,Ted:,"Really?
"
5,14,163,Barney:,"Yeah. I ate at the Tavern of vegetables, I started talking to the Swedish Top Model, and the next moment we batifolait in the back of a carriage. Go my beautiful, Hue!
"
5,14,164,Ted:,"Great. What really happened?
"
5,14,165,Barney:,"I ate at the ""Staten Island Chili's,"" and I jumped a hairdresser completely stuffed. Are you happy, Ulysses?
"
5,14,166,Lily:,"Barney, we know that you are going you may get fired. Wait, you ought to speak. You turn away from reality, kissing unnecessarily on all sides.
"
5,14,167,Barney:,"No vain, ok? Between number 5 and I, there was a connection. She will resume her studies, she has a child or who is studying... something with ""studies"".
"
5,14,168,Ted:,"Now my students have taught me that Jen Coulin abandon my material.
"
5,14,169,Marshall:,"Oh, my God, you've really pushed to the limit.
"
5,14,170,Robin:,"It scales all his education in the toilet.
"
5,14,171,Ted:,"News from Dale?
"
5,14,172,Robin:,"It's only been five days, he will call!
"
5,14,173,Marshall:,"What do you care? You said it was a big con.
"
5,14,174,Robin:,"Tell Dale not like that, ok? It is twice as good as you never will!
"
5,14,175,Lily:,"God forbid, if you manage to find a job, sell your apartment.Marshall and I, we have a free room. You can stay as long as you want.
"
5,14,176,Robin:,"Forget not you bring your toothbrush.
"
5,14,177,Ted:,"Lily, what are you doing?
"
5,14,178,Lily:,"I talk to my friend who is going through a difficult period.
"
5,14,179,Marshall:,"He's doing very well.
"
5,14,180,Lily:,"Try to sleep with seven women in seven nights, that's not what I would call ""very well get out."" It is a cry for help.
"
5,14,181,Ted:,"His whole life is a call for help. But we do not mess with a man who is in the midst of a no...
"
5,14,182,Lily:,"What? Without fault? Flawless, faultless, flawless! Grow up a little!
"
5,14,183,Jim:,"Unbelievable. You know, there are two things that do not.First: you do not open an email from Phil Simms to your children.And second: you do not wear bad luck to a man on track to flawless.
"
5,14,184,Barney:,"I do not know what to tell you, Lily is always trying to ruin me any.
"
5,14,185,Jim:,"I think she cracked a bit for the Barnacle.
"
5,14,186,Barney:,"You have the eye to notice such details, Jim Nantz.
"
5,14,187,Ted:,"I can not believe that thou hast brought him bad luck.
"
5,14,188,Marshall:,"He has no chance.
"
5,14,189,Lily:,"Ok, I have a question. If I ruined everything, why is it that Barney is in the process of hanging the girl three martinis in there?
"
5,14,190,Ted:,"Oh, my God!
"
5,14,191,Marshall:,"There's going to happen!
"
5,14,192,Lily:,"Yeah, you know? Doors-jinx, it does not exist.
"
5,14,193,Jim:,"Do not tell me that she dared to say ""The door-jinx, it does not exist.""
"
5,14,194,Barney:,"I wish I had power.
"
5,14,195,Jim:,"You were about to achieve something so beautiful.
"
5,14,196,Barney:,"Well, thank you to her, the only thing that can prevent a stroke insured was about to walk out the door. A member of the New York Yankees World Champions in 2009.
"
5,14,197,Marshall:,"Lily, I'll buy my own toothbrush.
"
5,14,198,Ted:,"Well, that's it. Barney's still got to 6.
"
5,14,199,Robin:,"What? Why? Because the guy with the weird cut went back?
"
5,14,200,Marshall:,"This is Nick Swisher. It is part of the New York Yankees. No regular guy from New York can not compete with a Yankee.
"
5,14,201,Ted:,"And this is true for a former Yankee. When I arrived here, I was the fourth date with a girl I loved a lot before I do the fly by Phil Rizzuto.
"
5,14,202,Marshall:,"I was there. Damn, this guy could play.
"
5,14,203,Robin:,"I'm still not.
"
5,14,204,Lily:,"Ok, let me do it the Canadian So how do you react if one of those guys with skates and sticks came back here?
"
5,14,205,Robin:,"Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks came here, I fall on my ass so that there would be a hole halfway to China in the soil.
"
5,14,206,Ted:,"It's the same thing for the Yankees.
"
5,14,207,Robin:,"Oh, Barney's done.
"
5,14,208,Marshall:,"It's happening, look.
"
5,14,209,Barney:,"You wanna come to my house and watch the collection of snowballs?
"
5,14,210,Marshall:,"A collection of snow globes?
"
5,14,211,Ted:,"He is pinball.
"
5,14,212,Woman:,"It's Nick Swisher!
"
5,14,213,Overall:,"Nice try.
"
5,14,214,Ted:,"It was well played, well played, well played.
"
5,14,215,Barney:,"But not play well enough. All this week was a waste of time. And tomorrow I'm getting fired.
"
5,14,216,Marshall:,"I'm sorry. But for what it's worth, this week was not a waste of time. We all had a horrible week, and you have helped us change a little air.
"
5,14,217,Ted:,"Yeah, I got my first drop.
"
5,14,218,Robin:,"I met my soul mate, and he never called back. Well, not yet. He will. He will.
"
5,14,219,Marshall:,"We frightened a couple great just because we share a toothbrush.
"
5,14,220,Barney:,"You share a toothbrush?
"
5,14,221,Robin:,"Well, they and Ted.
"
5,14,222,Barney:,".. Huh?
"
5,14,223,Ted:,"Wait a minute. When we went out together, you borrow the toothbrush all the time.
"
5,14,224,Robin:,"Oh, sh1t.
"
5,14,225,Ted (2030):,"And that's when Aunt Lily has seen what is great about sport, they make you forget about your problems, but only for a little while. And deep within us, we all needed this flawlessly.
"
5,14,226,Ted:,"At the second she sits next to Swisher, we reach the end.
"
5,14,227,Marshall:,"Wait a minute! Aldrin was seen. She tries to escape, she jumps, and... I thought she would not do that.
"
5,14,228,Woman:,"Oh my God, are you?
"
5,14,229,Lily:,"Yeah, sorry. I'm so clumsy! Oh, thank you. I think I twisted my ankle. Do what you can bring me some ice?
"
5,14,230,Woman:,"Sure.
"
5,14,231,Marshall:,"She did! I believe that there is no jinx finally.
"
5,14,232,Wendy:,"I'm bringing ice, Lily.
"
5,14,233,Marshall:,"Damn. Swisher is back in play Swisher is back in play!
"
5,14,234,Ted:,"Follow me. Hey, Nick Swisher! This guy and his wife share a toothbrush!
"
5,14,235,Nick:,"And?
"
5,14,236,Ted:,"And it's weird, right?
"
5,14,237,Nick:,"Actually, I think it's cute. Are we not try to find someone who could share his toothbrush?
"
5,14,238,Marshall:,"I'm sorry. Lily, Nick Swisher think it's cute.
"
5,14,239,Barney:,"Martini?
"
5,14,240,Ted:,"You take a beer with a Yankee, if that's not cool!
"
5,14,241,Robin:,"That's great, I'm all baseball. Mookie Wilson, while a player eh?
"
5,14,242,Nick:,"Yeah, baseball is great, but I tell you, this is not hockey.
"
5,14,243,Robin:,"I live just above.
"
5,14,244,Woman:,"What do you say we go home?
"
5,14,245,Barney:,"Wow, to be honest, this is not my habit, but I feel a real connection, Number 7... Christy. I beg you. I did it! I did it!
"
5,14,246,Jim:,"Unbelievable. Congratulations on your faultless.
"
5,14,247,Barney:,"Thank you, Jim. I would never have done it without the help of my friends.
"
5,14,248,Jim:,"Hey, on another subject, you really think you could get fired today?
"
5,14,249,Barney:,"Uh, Jim, I told you I wanted to talk about it.
"
5,14,250,Jim:,"Barney, I go straight from your imagination, so apparently we must talk! Think about it.
"
5,14,251,Barney:,"What a c**t.
"
5,14,252,Jim:,"You're the idiot.
"
5,14,253,Woman:,"Mr. Donovan will see you now.
"
5,14,254,Mr Donovan:,"Stinson, we made a decision. We keep you. I know this last week has been hard.
"
5,14,255,Barney:,"I barely slept.
"
5,14,256,Marshall:,"That's the guy, the official caps of no fault of Barney. I was going to make t-shirts, but you know, sizes, all that, and it would hurt me to think.
"
5,14,257,Lily:,"In commemoration, at the entrance to the Barney legend, this tie, worn during his seventh night of her flawless, freshly removed.
"
5,14,258,Marshall:,"May the heroic story of Barney to be remembered, and transmitted from generation to generation.
"
5,14,259,Ted:,"I already see myself in front of my children, trying to tell them when their uncle Barney kissed 7 chicks in a row.
"
5,14,260,Ted (2030):,"Is what I'm a bad father?
"
5,14,261,Wendy:,"A command to Coulin Jen? It has a large commission for Jen Coulin here.
"
5,14,262,Ted:,"You send Wendy to say now? Go! It's good, I understood.Jen Coulin is a crap name, and it becomes increasingly shitty when it is repeated. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin.
"
5,14,263,Jen:,"Present.
"
5,2,1,TED (2030):," This is the story of two blind dates. One in 2009... And one seven years earlier. In all that time, my dating routine remained more or less the same... until the fall of 2009, when I finally had a date that was different. Because it was exactly the same. I was on a blind date with the same woman I went on a blind date with seven years earlier.
"
5,2,2,Jen:,"Ted?
"
5,2,3,Ted:,"Jen?
"
5,2,4,Jen:,"It's nice to meet you.
"
5,2,5,Ted (2030):,"And she didn't remember it. But then again...
"
5,2,6,Ted:,"It's nice to meet you, too.
"
5,2,7,Ted (2030):,"Neither did I.
"
5,2,8,Barney:,"Guess who just got four tickets to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" Star Wars exhibit?
"
5,2,9,Lily:,"Why?
"
5,2,10,Barney:,"No, I said, ""Guess who?""
"
5,2,11,Lily:," I heard you.
"
5,2,12,Robin:,"Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?
"
5,2,13,Marshall:,"What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?
"
5,2,14,Barney:,"Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?
"
5,2,15,Marshall:,"Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful.
"
5,2,16,Barney:,"We're not going to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls.
"
5,2,17,Marshall:,"Where are you taking me, Barney?
"
5,2,18,Ted (2030):,"This wasn't the first time your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.
"
5,2,19,Ted:,"Wait a second, the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?
"
5,2,20,Barney:,"My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.
"
5,2,21,Ted:,"Stop the cab.
"
5,2,22,Marshall:,"Where are you taking me?
"
5,2,23,Marshall:,"Barney, why are we here?
"
5,2,24,Barney:,"Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.
"
5,2,25,Marshall:,"Thanks, man.
"
5,2,26,Barney:,"You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.
"
5,2,27,Marshall:,"Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?
"
5,2,28,Barney:,"Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.
"
5,2,29,Ted (2030):,"Meanwhile, Jen and I were at my favourite first date restaurant... for the second time.
"
5,2,30,Ted:,"So, Jen, what do you do?
"
5,2,31,Jen:,"I'm between jobs banking crisis.
"
5,2,32,Jen:,"I'm between jobs Internet bubble burst. Makes me realize I should go into something more stable... like banking. So what about you?
"
5,2,33,Ted:,"I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline.
"
5,2,34,Ted:,"I teach architecture. Get 50% off so, that's pretty sweet.
"
5,2,35,Marshall:,"Married!
"
5,2,36,Barney:,"What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.
"
5,2,37,Marshall:,"I do! It's just not that easy.
"
5,2,38,Barney:,"False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.
"
5,2,39,Marshall:,"Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.
"
5,2,40,Doctor:," Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medical illegitimate.
"
5,2,41,Marshall :,"What?! How could this be?!
"
5,2,42,Doctor:,"Beats me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have.
"
5,2,43,Lily:,"It's time, baby.
"
5,2,44,Marshall:,"I will never love again.
"
5,2,45,Lily:,"No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.
"
5,2,46,Priest:,"And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield.
"
5,2,47,Delivery girl:,"Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.
"
5,2,48,Marshall:,"(kissing his hand and looking up and ) This one's for you Lily. (to the delivery girl, opening his shirt) Where do I sign?
"
5,2,49,Marshall:,"And then watch out, because it is on!
"
5,2,50,Barney:,"That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.
"
5,2,51,Marshall:,"It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.
"
5,2,52,Barney:,"I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.
"
5,2,53,Voice:,"Gentlemen, say hello J-J-J-Jasmine.
"
5,2,54,Marsahll:,"Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?
"
5,2,55,Barney:,"Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!
"
5,2,56,Ted:," Yeah, I can't talk right now.
"
5,2,57,Barney:,"I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!
"
5,2,58,Marshall:,"Stop looking at her.
"
5,2,59,Ted:,"Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.
"
5,2,60,Barney:,"Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.
"
5,2,61,Marshall:,"(hitting him) I'll kill you!
"
5,2,62,Ted:,"(hanging up his cellular) Sorry about that.
"
5,2,63,Jen:,"So, any thoughts on food?
"
5,2,64,Ted:,"Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?
"
5,2,65,Jen:,"I would love to share the oysters.
"
5,2,66,Ted:," Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.
"
5,2,67,Jen:,"Wow, that's bad.
"
5,2,68,Ted:,"That's why it's funny!
"
5,2,69,Ted and Jen:,"We've been on this date before.
"
5,2,70,Ted:,"We've been on this exact blind date before.
"
5,2,71,Jen:,"In this exact same restaurant.
"
5,2,72,Ted:,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.
"
5,2,73,Jen:,"Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby.
"
5,2,74,Ted:,"Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.
"
5,2,75,Jen:,"They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.
"
5,2,76,Ted:,"Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.
"
5,2,77,Jen:,"Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we?
"
5,2,78,Ted:,"Well, you've got your cats.
"
5,2,79,Jen:,"This is insane.
"
5,2,80,Ted:,"Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?
"
5,2,81,Jen:,"Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there... (showing a table)
"
5,2,82,Ted:,"Main Lobster. They spelled ""Maine"" without the ""e."" Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...
"
5,2,83,Jen:,"I get it, Ted.
"
5,2,84,Jen:,"Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.
"
5,2,85,Ted:,"Huh. I had no idea.
"
5,2,86,Jen:,"Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?
"
5,2,87,Ted:,"That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.
"
5,2,88,Jen:,"Huh. I had no idea.
"
5,2,89,Ted:,"This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.
"
5,2,90,Jen:,"We really are. Okay, I'm in.
"
5,2,91,Ted:,"Great.
"
5,2,92,Jen:,"Where'd we go next?
"
5,2,93,Ted:,"I think we went to MacLaren's.
"
5,2,94,Jen:,"Okay.
"
5,2,95,Jen:,"Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?
"
5,2,96,Jen:,"And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.
"
5,2,97,Jen:,"Tone down the kitty talk. Check.
"
5,2,98,Barney:,"You will not believe who we saw tonight.
"
5,2,99,Marshall:,"Dude, um...
"
5,2,100,Barney:,"We saw the third doppelganger!
"
5,2,101,Ted (2030):,"I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like
"
5,2,102,Barney:,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! (showing a girl who spits on the ground)
"
5,2,103,Ted (2030):,"Lesbian Robin.
"
5,2,104,Ted (2030):,"And Moustache Marshall. By the following summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that.
"
5,2,105,Barney:,"Ladies, meet Stripper Lily. (showing a photo in his cellular)
"
5,2,106,Lily:,"Oh!
"
5,2,107,Barney:,"Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.
"
5,2,108,Lily:,"So you went to a strip club?
"
5,2,109,Barney:,"Busted.
"
5,2,110,Lily:,"And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?
"
5,2,111,Marshall:,"Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...
"
5,2,112,Lily:,"Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.
"
5,2,113,Robin:,"So... Strip club.
"
5,2,114,Barney:,"Marshall made me go.
"
5,2,115,Ted:,"All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.
"
5,2,116,Jen:,"Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.
"
5,2,117,Jen:,"It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?
"
5,2,118,Ted:,"Not really.
"
5,2,119,Jen:,"Really? I can't feel my fingers.
"
5,2,120,Ted:,"I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.
"
5,2,121,Ted:,"I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.
"
5,2,122,Jen:,"After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.
"
5,2,123,Ted:,"I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.
"
5,2,124,Jen:,"Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?
"
5,2,125,Ted:,"See? Why didn't you lead off with that?
"
5,2,126,Lily:,"Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.
"
5,2,127,Barney:,"See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.
"
5,2,128,Robin:,"I'm not cool with it.
"
5,2,129,Barney:,"Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.
"
5,2,130,Robin:,"It's disgusting.
"
5,2,131,Barney:,"Because it's harmless.
"
5,2,132,Robin:,"Did one of your whores tell you that?
"
5,2,133,Barney:,"And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.
"
5,2,134,Lily:,"Trouble? What trouble?
"
5,2,135,Marshall:,"It's, no, it's nothing.
"
5,2,136,Barney:,"Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.
"
5,2,137,Robin:,"No, we're not.
"
5,2,138,Marshall:,"Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.
"
5,2,139,Lily:,"You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!
"
5,2,140,Marshall:,"Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.
"
5,2,141,Ted:,"Remember? (showing the Mc Laren's bar)
"
5,2,142,Jen:,"Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.
"
5,2,143,Ted:,"You loved them.
"
5,2,144,Jen:,"They're family, Ted.
"
5,2,145,Ted:,"Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly ""can't think"" of anything I do wrong.
"
5,2,146,Robin:,"Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check
"
5,2,147,Lily:,"Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.
"
5,2,148,Marshall:,"Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!
"
5,2,149,Jen:,"Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.
"
5,2,150,Ted:,"Me?
"
5,2,151,All the other:,"Ted?
"
5,2,152,Jen:,"Yeah. We were all sitting over there... (showing a table)
"
5,2,153,Jen:,"And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...
"
5,2,154,Lily:,"What about Cat Woman?
"
5,2,155,Jen:,"Yeah, that would've been good.
"
5,2,156,Barney:,"Psst! Ted! (showing a girl with his head)
"
5,2,157,Ted:,"(looking at the girl) Nice.
"
5,2,158,Ted:,"Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.
"
5,2,159,Ted:,"Nice.
"
5,2,160,Ted:,"We were checking out Moustache Marshall.
"
5,2,161,The other:,"Ah...
"
5,2,162,Jen:,"Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry.
"
5,2,163,Ted:,"Yeah, well, it's nice to know ""past me"" wasn't a total jackass, huh?
"
5,2,164,Jen:,"""Present you"" isn't so bad, either.
"
5,2,165,Jen:,"Thank you very much.
"
5,2,166,Ted:,"You got it.
"
5,2,167,Jen:,"Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.
"
5,2,168,Ted:,"...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.
"
5,2,169,Jen:,"Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.
"
5,2,170,Ted:,"Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best
"
5,2,171,Jen:,"Me, too.
"
5,2,172,Ted:,"That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?
"
5,2,173,Jen:,"I remember now.
"
5,2,174,Jen:,"(after the kiss) Wow.
"
5,2,175,Ted:,"Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?
"
5,2,176,Jen:,"Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me?
"
5,2,177,Ted:,"Absolutely.
"
5,2,178,Jen:,"Promise?
"
5,2,179,Ted:,"Promise.
"
5,2,180,Ted:,"I have been so busy.
"
5,2,181,Jen:,"Good night, Ted.
"
5,2,182,Jen:,"Hello?
"
5,2,183,Ted:,"Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.
"
5,2,184,Jen:,"Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.
"
5,2,185,Lily:,"Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, killing me off.
"
5,2,186,Marhsall:,"I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and s*x. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.
"
5,2,187,Lily:,"All right, we got to fix this.
"
5,2,188,Lily:,"Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.
"
5,2,189,Marshall:,"Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.
"
5,2,190,Lily:,"Bring out Stripper Lily!
"
5,2,191,Barney:,"(to Robin) You know, I don't come here that much.
"
5,2,192,Waitress:,"Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching.
"
5,2,193,Barney:,"Thank you, kindly stranger.
"
5,2,194,Voice:,"Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, hey, Barney. Didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for J-J-Jasmine.
"
5,2,195,Lily:,"I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?
"
5,2,196,Marshall:,"That was a hundred?
"
5,2,197,Lily:,"Wow, she crawls fast.
"
5,2,198,Ted:,"Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.
"
5,2,199,Jen:,"The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.
"
5,2,200,Ted:,"No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what
"
5,2,201,Ted imagines:,"She wants to pay the restaurant. He offers her his jacket. They takes pictures with Moustache Marshall. He calls her after their date. They marry.
"
5,2,202,Jen:,"Wow.
"
5,2,203,Marshall:,"Wow.
"
5,2,204,Barney:,"You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.
"
5,2,205,Robin:,"I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.
"
5,2,206,Barney:,"Just the best.
"
5,2,207,Marshall:,"Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.
"
5,2,208,Barney:,"Just the best.
"
5,2,209,Jen:,"... now what?
"
5,2,210,Ted:,"I just remembered why I didn't call you.
"
5,2,211,Jen:,"Why?
"
5,2,212,Ted:,"I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.
"
5,2,213,Jen:,"What?
"
5,2,214,Ted:,"And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.
"
5,2,215,Jen:,"Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.
"
5,2,216,Ted:,"Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?
"
5,2,217,Jen:,"Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.
"
5,2,218,Ted:,"Well... good luck out there, Jen.
"
5,2,219,Jen:,"You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.
"
5,2,220,Ted (2030):,"And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.
"
5,2,221,Marshall:,"Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.
"
5,2,222,Lily:,"(smoking and looking weird) What did you say, buddy?
"
5,2,223,Marshall:,"Lily?
"
5,2,224,Lily:,"Who? Oh, yes... I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping?
"
5,2,225,Marshall:,"(going on the stage) Lily!
"
5,2,226,Barney:,"Guess who just got four tickets to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" Star Wars exhibit?
"
5,2,227,Lily:,"Why?
"
5,2,228,Barney:,"No, I said, ""Guess who?""
"
5,2,229,Lily:," I heard you.
"
5,2,230,Robin:,"Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?
"
5,2,231,Marshall:,"What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?
"
5,2,232,Barney:,"Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?
"
5,2,233,Marshall:,"Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful.
"
5,2,234,Barney:,"We're not going to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls.
"
5,2,235,Marshall:,"Where are you taking me, Barney?
"
5,2,236,Ted (2030):,"This wasn't the first time your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.
"
5,2,237,Ted:,"Wait a second, the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?
"
5,2,238,Barney:,"My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.
"
5,2,239,Ted:,"Stop the cab.
"
5,2,240,Marshall:,"Where are you taking me?
"
5,2,241,Marshall:,"Barney, why are we here?
"
5,2,242,Barney:,"Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.
"
5,2,243,Marshall:,"Thanks, man.
"
5,2,244,Barney:,"You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.
"
5,2,245,Marshall:,"Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?
"
5,2,246,Barney:,"Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.
"
5,2,247,Ted (2030):,"Meanwhile, Jen and I were at my favourite first date restaurant... for the second time.
"
5,2,248,Ted:,"So, Jen, what do you do?
"
5,2,249,Jen:,"I'm between jobs banking crisis.
"
5,2,250,Jen:,"I'm between jobs Internet bubble burst. Makes me realize I should go into something more stable... like banking. So what about you?
"
5,2,251,Ted:,"I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline.
"
5,2,252,Ted:,"I teach architecture. Get 50% off so, that's pretty sweet.
"
5,2,253,Marshall:,"Married!
"
5,2,254,Barney:,"What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.
"
5,2,255,Marshall:,"I do! It's just not that easy.
"
5,2,256,Barney:,"False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.
"
5,2,257,Marshall:,"Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.
"
5,2,258,Doctor:," Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medical illegitimate.
"
5,2,259,Marshall :,"What?! How could this be?!
"
5,2,260,Doctor:,"Beats me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have.
"
5,2,261,Lily:,"It's time, baby.
"
5,2,262,Marshall:,"I will never love again.
"
5,2,263,Lily:,"No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.
"
5,2,264,Priest:,"And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield.
"
5,2,265,Delivery girl:,"Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.
"
5,2,266,Marshall:,"(kissing his hand and looking up and ) This one's for you Lily. (to the delivery girl, opening his shirt) Where do I sign?
"
5,2,267,Marshall:,"And then watch out, because it is on!
"
5,2,268,Barney:,"That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.
"
5,2,269,Marshall:,"It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.
"
5,2,270,Barney:,"I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.
"
5,2,271,Voice:,"Gentlemen, say hello J-J-J-Jasmine.
"
5,2,272,Marsahll:,"Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?
"
5,2,273,Barney:,"Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!
"
5,2,274,Ted:," Yeah, I can't talk right now.
"
5,2,275,Barney:,"I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!
"
5,2,276,Marshall:,"Stop looking at her.
"
5,2,277,Ted:,"Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.
"
5,2,278,Barney:,"Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.
"
5,2,279,Marshall:,"(hitting him) I'll kill you!
"
5,2,280,Ted:,"(hanging up his cellular) Sorry about that.
"
5,2,281,Jen:,"So, any thoughts on food?
"
5,2,282,Ted:,"Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?
"
5,2,283,Jen:,"I would love to share the oysters.
"
5,2,284,Ted:," Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.
"
5,2,285,Jen:,"Wow, that's bad.
"
5,2,286,Ted:,"That's why it's funny!
"
5,2,287,Ted and Jen:,"We've been on this date before.
"
5,2,288,Ted:,"We've been on this exact blind date before.
"
5,2,289,Jen:,"In this exact same restaurant.
"
5,2,290,Ted:,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.
"
5,2,291,Jen:,"Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby.
"
5,2,292,Ted:,"Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.
"
5,2,293,Jen:,"They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.
"
5,2,294,Ted:,"Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.
"
5,2,295,Jen:,"Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we?
"
5,2,296,Ted:,"Well, you've got your cats.
"
5,2,297,Jen:,"This is insane.
"
5,2,298,Ted:,"Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?
"
5,2,299,Jen:,"Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there... (showing a table)
"
5,2,300,Ted:,"Main Lobster. They spelled ""Maine"" without the ""e."" Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...
"
5,2,301,Jen:,"I get it, Ted.
"
5,2,302,Jen:,"Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.
"
5,2,303,Ted:,"Huh. I had no idea.
"
5,2,304,Jen:,"Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?
"
5,2,305,Ted:,"That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.
"
5,2,306,Jen:,"Huh. I had no idea.
"
5,2,307,Ted:,"This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.
"
5,2,308,Jen:,"We really are. Okay, I'm in.
"
5,2,309,Ted:,"Great.
"
5,2,310,Jen:,"Where'd we go next?
"
5,2,311,Ted:,"I think we went to MacLaren's.
"
5,2,312,Jen:,"Okay.
"
5,2,313,Jen:,"Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?
"
5,2,314,Jen:,"And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.
"
5,2,315,Jen:,"Tone down the kitty talk. Check.
"
5,2,316,Barney:,"You will not believe who we saw tonight.
"
5,2,317,Marshall:,"Dude, um...
"
5,2,318,Barney:,"We saw the third doppelganger!
"
5,2,319,Ted (2030):,"I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like
"
5,2,320,Barney:,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! (showing a girl who spits on the ground)
"
5,2,321,Ted (2030):,"Lesbian Robin.
"
5,2,322,Ted (2030):,"And Moustache Marshall. By the following summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that.
"
5,2,323,Barney:,"Ladies, meet Stripper Lily. (showing a photo in his cellular)
"
5,2,324,Lily:,"Oh!
"
5,2,325,Barney:,"Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.
"
5,2,326,Lily:,"So you went to a strip club?
"
5,2,327,Barney:,"Busted.
"
5,2,328,Lily:,"And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?
"
5,2,329,Marshall:,"Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...
"
5,2,330,Lily:,"Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.
"
5,2,331,Robin:,"So... Strip club.
"
5,2,332,Barney:,"Marshall made me go.
"
5,2,333,Ted:,"All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.
"
5,2,334,Jen:,"Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.
"
5,2,335,Jen:,"It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?
"
5,2,336,Ted:,"Not really.
"
5,2,337,Jen:,"Really? I can't feel my fingers.
"
5,2,338,Ted:,"I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.
"
5,2,339,Ted:,"I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.
"
5,2,340,Jen:,"After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.
"
5,2,341,Ted:,"I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.
"
5,2,342,Jen:,"Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?
"
5,2,343,Ted:,"See? Why didn't you lead off with that?
"
5,2,344,Lily:,"Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.
"
5,2,345,Barney:,"See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.
"
5,2,346,Robin:,"I'm not cool with it.
"
5,2,347,Barney:,"Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.
"
5,2,348,Robin:,"It's disgusting.
"
5,2,349,Barney:,"Because it's harmless.
"
5,2,350,Robin:,"Did one of your whores tell you that?
"
5,2,351,Barney:,"And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.
"
5,2,352,Lily:,"Trouble? What trouble?
"
5,2,353,Marshall:,"It's, no, it's nothing.
"
5,2,354,Barney:,"Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.
"
5,2,355,Robin:,"No, we're not.
"
5,2,356,Marshall:,"Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.
"
5,2,357,Lily:,"You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!
"
5,2,358,Marshall:,"Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.
"
5,2,359,Ted:,"Remember? (showing the Mc Laren's bar)
"
5,2,360,Jen:,"Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.
"
5,2,361,Ted:,"You loved them.
"
5,2,362,Jen:,"They're family, Ted.
"
5,2,363,Ted:,"Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly ""can't think"" of anything I do wrong.
"
5,2,364,Robin:,"Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check
"
5,2,365,Lily:,"Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.
"
5,2,366,Marshall:,"Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!
"
5,2,367,Jen:,"Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.
"
5,2,368,Ted:,"Me?
"
5,2,369,All the other:,"Ted?
"
5,2,370,Jen:,"Yeah. We were all sitting over there... (showing a table)
"
5,2,371,Jen:,"And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...
"
5,2,372,Lily:,"What about Cat Woman?
"
5,2,373,Jen:,"Yeah, that would've been good.
"
5,2,374,Barney:,"Psst! Ted! (showing a girl with his head)
"
5,2,375,Ted:,"(looking at the girl) Nice.
"
5,2,376,Ted:,"Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.
"
5,2,377,Ted:,"Nice.
"
5,2,378,Ted:,"We were checking out Moustache Marshall.
"
5,2,379,The other:,"Ah...
"
5,2,380,Jen:,"Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry.
"
5,2,381,Ted:,"Yeah, well, it's nice to know ""past me"" wasn't a total jackass, huh?
"
5,2,382,Jen:,"""Present you"" isn't so bad, either.
"
5,2,383,Jen:,"Thank you very much.
"
5,2,384,Ted:,"You got it.
"
5,2,385,Jen:,"Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.
"
5,2,386,Ted:,"...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.
"
5,2,387,Jen:,"Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.
"
5,2,388,Ted:,"Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best
"
5,2,389,Jen:,"Me, too.
"
5,2,390,Ted:,"That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?
"
5,2,391,Jen:,"I remember now.
"
5,2,392,Jen:,"(after the kiss) Wow.
"
5,2,393,Ted:,"Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?
"
5,2,394,Jen:,"Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me?
"
5,2,395,Ted:,"Absolutely.
"
5,2,396,Jen:,"Promise?
"
5,2,397,Ted:,"Promise.
"
5,2,398,Ted:,"I have been so busy.
"
5,2,399,Jen:,"Good night, Ted.
"
5,2,400,Jen:,"Hello?
"
5,2,401,Ted:,"Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.
"
5,2,402,Jen:,"Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.
"
5,2,403,Lily:,"Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, killing me off.
"
5,2,404,Marhsall:,"I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and s*x. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.
"
5,2,405,Lily:,"All right, we got to fix this.
"
5,2,406,Lily:,"Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.
"
5,2,407,Marshall:,"Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.
"
5,2,408,Lily:,"Bring out Stripper Lily!
"
5,2,409,Barney:,"(to Robin) You know, I don't come here that much.
"
5,2,410,Waitress:,"Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching.
"
5,2,411,Barney:,"Thank you, kindly stranger.
"
5,2,412,Voice:,"Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, hey, Barney. Didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for J-J-Jasmine.
"
5,2,413,Lily:,"I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?
"
5,2,414,Marshall:,"That was a hundred?
"
5,2,415,Lily:,"Wow, she crawls fast.
"
5,2,416,Ted:,"Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.
"
5,2,417,Jen:,"The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.
"
5,2,418,Ted:,"No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what
"
5,2,419,Ted imagines:,"She wants to pay the restaurant. He offers her his jacket. They takes pictures with Moustache Marshall. He calls her after their date. They marry.
"
5,2,420,Jen:,"Wow.
"
5,2,421,Marshall:,"Wow.
"
5,2,422,Barney:,"You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.
"
5,2,423,Robin:,"I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.
"
5,2,424,Barney:,"Just the best.
"
5,2,425,Marshall:,"Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.
"
5,2,426,Barney:,"Just the best.
"
5,2,427,Jen:,"... now what?
"
5,2,428,Ted:,"I just remembered why I didn't call you.
"
5,2,429,Jen:,"Why?
"
5,2,430,Ted:,"I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.
"
5,2,431,Jen:,"What?
"
5,2,432,Ted:,"And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.
"
5,2,433,Jen:,"Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.
"
5,2,434,Ted:,"Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?
"
5,2,435,Jen:,"Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.
"
5,2,436,Ted:,"Well... good luck out there, Jen.
"
5,2,437,Jen:,"You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.
"
5,2,438,Ted (2030):,"And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.
"
5,2,439,Marshall:,"Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.
"
5,2,440,Lily:,"(smoking and looking weird) What did you say, buddy?
"
5,2,441,Marshall:,"Lily?
"
5,2,442,Lily:,"Who? Oh, yes... I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping?
"
5,2,443,Marshall:,"(going on the stage) Lily!
"
5,16,1,Ted (2030):,"The children in my stories, I'm a romantic idealist in search of true love. In it, I'm just stupid.
"
5,16,2,Ted:,"Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras.
"
5,16,3,Barney:,"It's the lure of Ted.
"
5,16,4,Lily:,"Bait?
"
5,16,5,Barney:,"A true gentleman invents an excuse to bring home a respectable lady. Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track.
"
5,16,6,Ted:,"As if she had to ""borrow a book"" or ""listen to old vinyl.""
"
5,16,7,Marshall:,"Or see your new poster rap.
"
5,16,8,Robin:,"Post rap? On which it would work?
"
5,16,9,Lily:,"It was the first week of college. I was way into Wu-Tang Clan.
"
5,16,10,Barney:,"It's tricky. It must be interesting enough that the girl up, but not too much not to spoil the evening.
"
5,16,11,Barney:,"The slot machine is too much fun. And a trampoline... that's actually too dangerous. But I finally found the perfect bait... A mini pig.
"
5,16,12,Ted:,"A mini pig? On which it would work?
"
5,16,13,Lily:,"You got a mini pig?
"
5,16,14,Robin:,"You can see the mini pig?
"
5,16,15,Ted:,"I can borrow your mini pig?
"
5,16,16,Barney:,"Yes, you can borrow.
"
5,16,17,Tiffany:,"You have a mini pig? I can not believe it! You're too cute!You're the cutest little pig on Earth! What?
"
5,16,18,Ted:,"You've always been so beautiful? You're going out on ""In high school I was super shy and I in my skin""?
"
5,16,19,Tiffany:,"I was shy and ill at ease. I'd like 50 more pounds and protruding teeth.
"
5,16,20,Ted:,"Seriously?
"
5,16,21,Tiffany:,"No. I was always canon. What can I do? You know who else would love this mini pig? (He goes to kiss) My boyfriend.
"
5,16,22,Ted:,"You got a boyfriend?
"
5,16,23,Tiffany:,"I know... Boring, eh? Finally, it is... not really my boyfriend.
"
5,16,24,Ted:,"Okay.
"
5,16,25,Tiffany:,"Well, technically it is.
"
5,16,26,Ted:,"He is or not?
"
5,16,27,Tiffany:,"A little each but not both.
"
5,16,28,Ted:,"Do you understand anything?
"
5,16,29,Tiffany:,"I appreciate you. But you must be patient. I do not want to lose you, my Dark Brown.
"
5,16,30,Ted:,"Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown.
"
5,16,31,Robin:,"She gave you her hook.
"
5,16,32,Ted:,"What? I am not to his hook.
"
5,16,33,Barney:,"Yes, completely.
"
5,16,34,Robin:,"It gives you false hope, but it does not engage with you, but it keeps you in the corner, just in case, like... an old canned chili in the pantry.
"
5,16,35,Lily:,"Who would buy a can of chili for not eating it away?
"
5,16,36,Marshall:,"Amen, sister.
"
5,16,37,Robin:,"Do you feel pretty good. It is gone. It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems.
"
5,16,38,Marshall:,"I've been hooked. Lisa Walker. See the scene... In 1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.
"
5,16,39,Marshall:,"So I was, like, thinking, Lisa, do, perhaps you want, like, go out with me?
"
5,16,40,Lisa:,"It sounds great. But I'm seeing this guy. It has a LeBaron convertible and an unlimited pass to the rink, so I would not miss it.
"
5,16,41,Marshall:,"I understand.
"
5,16,42,Lisa:,"What if we did that? You could be my secret boyfriend who does all my homework.
"
5,16,43,Marshall:,"Okay. Wanna see my post of rap?
"
5,16,44,Lily:,"Whore posting!
"
5,16,45,Marshall:,"So... Lisa Walker gave me false hope for months until one night I went to tell him how much I loved her. In song.
"
5,16,46,Marshall:,"She was not home yet so I waited. And expected. I woke up, covered with snow, after 4h. And then I saw them. The footprints of Lisa. She had passed right by me to the house.
"
5,16,47,Marshall:,"It was fine in the end. It freed me from its hook.
"
5,16,48,Ted:,"That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen.
"
5,16,49,Tiffany:,"You interest me very much. But I can not be with you for now.
"
5,16,50,Robin:,"""Right now"" is the catch phrase of choice.
"
5,16,51,Marshall:,"""For now"" you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen.
"
5,16,52,Barney:,"It's like that. ""I can not be with you"". ""For now.""
"
5,16,53,Lily:,"I think my high school boyfriend Scooter, is a little to my hook.
"
5,16,54,Marshall:,"A little? Completely. The poor showed up at our wedding hope you recover.
"
5,16,55,Lily:,"It's weird when I see him at work.
"
5,16,56,Marshall:,"Wait. What?
"
5,16,57,Lily:,"Scooter works in the Ikea cafeteria 'school. We talked.
"
5,16,58,Scooter:,"Nice dress. French fries? I love you.
"
5,16,59,Marshall:,"We certainly do not talk about that!
"
5,16,60,Lily:,"But if. I talked to full time. ""Scooter canteen.""
"
5,16,61,Marshall:,"I thought you was talking about a long-awaited means of transport, carrying such poor canteen.
"
5,16,62,Lily:,"It explains a lot.
"
5,16,63,Lily:,"Scooter canteen was still there today.
"
5,16,64,Marshall:,"You're mounted on it? You did a tour?
"
5,16,65,Lily:,"No!
"
5,16,66,Marshall:,"Really? In your place I would have rode this scooter all day to break it into two.
"
5,16,67,Marshall:,"So these poor women must still walk? Expect. Scooter works in your school?
"
5,16,68,Lily:,"Are you jealous?
"
5,16,69,Marshall:,"I feel bad for Scooter. It took this job just because he thinks he has a chance with you. You must ensure that he understands that it is wrong for it turns the page and gets a real work canteen. sh1t!
"
5,16,70,Lily:,"I tried!
"
5,16,71,Scooter:,"I saw that you had free time. So do I. And if you fled?
"
5,16,72,Lily:,"Let me be clear, Scooter. There is no way that you and I are together. For now.
"
5,16,73,Scooter:,"See you tomorrow. It's Tuesday Tijuana.
"
5,16,74,Marshall:,"""For now""? You got to the earnest Scooter? You must release your scooter hook.
"
5,16,75,Lily:,"You're right. Tomorrow, that's what I'll do.
"
5,16,76,Marshall:,"Why not tomorrow?
"
5,16,77,Lily:,"I can not spoil the Tijuana Tuesday.
"
5,16,78,Barney:,"Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass?
"
5,16,79,Ted:,"I will not give up.
"
5,16,80,Ted (2030):,"I should have quit.
"
5,16,81,Ted:,"This girl is special.
"
5,16,82,Ted (2030):,"It was the devil!
"
5,16,83,Ted:,"It will get better with Tiffany.
"
5,16,84,Ted (2030):,"No, moron!
"
5,16,85,Barney:,"Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever.
"
5,16,86,Ted:,"There she is. (Between Tiffany followed by several other women) It has led to colleagues.
"
5,16,87,Barney:,"Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?
"
5,16,88,Ted:,"Yep.
"
5,16,89,Barney:,"There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?
"
5,16,90,Ted:,"How do you know?
"
5,16,91,Barney:,"And you never thought to say?
"
5,16,92,Ted:,"What? It's just a job.
"
5,16,93,Barney:,"That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls guns, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?
"
5,16,94,Ted:,"I will not say explicitly.
"
5,16,95,Barney:,"It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. Homo erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, ""Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. "" So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.
"
5,16,96,Tiffany:,"Hi my great darkness. How are you?
"
5,16,97,Ted:,"Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy?
"
5,16,98,Tiffany:,"No, sir.
"
5,16,99,Ted:,"She touched my nose.
"
5,16,100,Barney:,"Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees burned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!
"
5,16,101,Marshall:,"I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes? (He returns with a mini pig) Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day.
"
5,16,102,Lily:,"Mini Pig, it is impossible that I may one day with you. For now.
"
5,16,103,Marshall:,"Go! Be a man!
"
5,16,104,Lily:,"I'm sorry, but it is just so cute. I just want to cuddle him all day. Oh, yes.
"
5,16,105,Marshall:,"You know, it's funny. I remember when you told me stuff like that.
"
5,16,106,Lily:,"I still do.
"
5,16,107,Marshall:,"Not as much. Not as much.
"
5,16,108,Barney:,"There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever.
"
5,16,109,Ted:,"Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook.
"
5,16,110,Robin:,"You're always on the hook.
"
5,16,111,Ted:,"Look what we did yesterday.
"
5,16,112,Ted:,"First, it was spoiled. Then we shared a chocolate cake.Then, well, I did not used to join the discussions of changing rooms, but I made her a foot massage... rather sensual.
"
5,16,113,Robin:,"And let me guess: it's not gone further than that.
"
5,16,114,Ted:,"Well, no, but...
"
5,16,115,Lily:,"And tell me, would you have accidentally made this chocolate cake?
"
5,16,116,Ted:,"It was a pre-made.
"
5,16,117,Lily:,"There's no shame to admit it. We were all hooked and we all hooked someone.
"
5,16,118,Ted:,"I've never done that.
"
5,16,119,Robin:,"Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta?
"
5,16,120,Ted:,"Henrietta and I are just friends.
"
5,16,121,Robin:,"It is too much to your hook.
"
5,16,122,Ted:,"Absolutely not.
"
5,16,123,Ted (2030):,"Yes, completely. Finally...
"
5,16,124,Ted (2030):,".. it was spoiled. We shared a chocolate cake. It made me long foot massages. I'm not proud of, children.
"
5,16,125,Robin:,"You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego.
"
5,16,126,Ted:,"You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job?
"
5,16,127,Robin:,"Mike and I are just friends.
"
5,16,128,Ted:,"Come on.
"
5,16,129,Robin:,"Yeah, right.
"
5,16,130,Mike:,"You never thought to go to the next step with me?
"
5,16,131,Robin:,"If you mean to do my laundry, I'm starting lineup.
"
5,16,132,Mike:,"It's a deal.
"
5,16,133,Robin:,"What! I do not keep Mike in my hook.
"
5,16,134,Ted:,"You're Captain Hook.
"
5,16,135,Robin:,"Dude, I'm a girl. Our female parts are like a cobweb.Sometimes you jokes of things you want to.
"
5,16,136,Ted:,"That's not why it's good.
"
5,16,137,Robin:,"And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh?
"
5,16,138,Ted:,"Henrietta knows we're just friends. In fact, I'll call and get away with it tonight, friends.
"
5,16,139,Henrietta:,"I love you. What? Want a foot massage? Because I'm driven on me.
"
5,16,140,Ted:,"No, that's fine.
"
5,16,141,Henrietta:,"I did not know if you were hungry, I did some stuff... Nothing special.
"
5,16,142,Ted (2030):,"Children, looking back, I do not know how I have not seen Henrietta was crazy about me.
"
5,16,143,Ted:,"Hello?
"
5,16,144,Tiffany:,"Hey Ted!
"
5,16,145,Ted:,"Hey Tiffany!
"
5,16,146,Tiffany:,"I go to the country this weekend at a friends wedding.Wanna be my cavalier?
"
5,16,147,Ted:,"I would love that. What are you doing here? Great. See you in 10 minutes. Super. Sorry, Henrietta, something unexpected.We redo it, my friend?
"
5,16,148,Henrietta:,"Yeah, it's not a concern.
"
5,16,149,Ted:,"It works, yeah.
"
5,16,150,Henrietta:,"You have the strength.
"
5,16,151,Ted (2030):,"What a jerk.
"
5,16,152,Mother of Henrietta:,"Wait. Where is Ted? I thought we would finally meet him.
"
5,16,153,Henrietta:,"An unexpected, okay, Mom?
"
5,16,154,Father:,"I told you there was not.
"
5,16,155,Henrietta:,"I heard.
"
5,16,156,Ted (2030):,"So there I was, at one of the surest signs to make a landing in a relationship: a country wedding. It finally came.
"
5,16,157,Ted:,"Champagne?
"
5,16,158,Tiffany:,"I forgot to call you.
"
5,16,159,Ted:,"Whatever it is, we can talk now.
"
5,16,160,Tiffany:,"This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding. We just get back together.
"
5,16,161,Ted:,"Now that I think a call would have been nice.
"
5,16,162,Jack:,"Is that you Ted? But I heard you were doing a great chocolate cake.
"
5,16,163,Tiffany:,"It is not great? And it is in a group. Thank you.
"
5,16,164,Marshall:,"Come on, Lily. You must drop Scooter. Try it again.
"
5,16,165,Lily:,"Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. For now.
"
5,16,166,Marshall:,"Act like a man!
"
5,16,167,Lily:,"Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. Ever.
"
5,16,168,Marshall:,"Finish him!
"
5,16,169,Lily:,"It will never be together in any sexual way again.
"
5,16,170,Marshall:,"Well done. Weird thing to say to a pig.
"
5,16,171,Lily:,"Really bad.
"
5,16,172,Tiffany:,"Well, I do not think it will work out between us. For now.
"
5,16,173,Ted (2030):,"And that's when it hit me. I was at his hook. I also realized...
"
5,16,174,Tiffany:,"You've missed so much, baby.
"
5,16,175,Ted (2030):,"Tiffany was to hook this guy. It was a vicious circle.Henrietta was my hook. And years later I learned that this poor guy was on the hook of Henrietta.
"
5,16,176,Ted:,"You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done. (He takes the jacket on the bed and hand) And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done.
"
5,16,177,Lily:,"I can do it alone.
"
5,16,178,Marshall:,"So prove it. And... take me a pudding.
"
5,16,179,Lily:,"Listen, Scooter. There is no way we ever be together.
"
5,16,180,Marshall:,"Right now! I'm sorry but he is adorable.
"
5,16,181,Lily:,"Listen. I want to be with you.
"
5,16,182,Marshall:,"So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.
"
5,16,183,Barney:,"Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?
"
5,16,184,Robin:,"There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.
"
5,16,185,Woman:,"I want you to meet the latest arrival.
"
5,16,186,Woman 2:,"Nice to meet you. I represent statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.
"
5,16,187,Woman:,"Let's go have a drink.
"
5,16,188,Barney:,"It's over.
"
5,16,189,Robin:,"What?
"
5,16,190,Barney:,"The girls of pharma are more than gunnery. This is the end of an era.
"
5,16,191,Robin:,"You're a little dramatic.
"
5,16,192,Barney:,"Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!
"
5,16,193,Ted (2030):,"So that night I went to live in Henrietta prepared to release it from my hook.
"
5,16,194,Tiffany:,"This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding.
"
5,16,195,Ted:,"I'm done.
"
5,16,196,Henrietta:,"The answer is yes!
"
5,16,197,Ted:,"It's worse.
"
5,16,198,Henrietta:,"This is perfect! Mom, Dad! Ted asked me to marry him!
"
5,16,199,Mother:,"I knew this would happen!
"
5,16,200,Father:,"My son!
"
5,16,201,Ted:,"Yeah, there was a...
"
5,16,202,Robin:,"What did you do?
"
5,16,203,Ted:,"Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart.
"
5,16,204,Ted:,"Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.
"
5,16,205,Henrietta:,"Right now?
"
5,16,206,Ted:,"Ever.
"
5,16,207,Henrietta:,"But we're still going to marry, does not it?
"
5,16,208,Ted:,"It was violent.
"
5,16,209,Robin:,"Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative. (Mike enters with the laundry basket) I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?
"
5,16,210,Mike:,"Another tour.
"
5,16,211,Robin:,"It can wait.
"
5,16,212,Robin:,"How are you?
"
5,16,213,Ted:,"You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?
"
5,16,214,Barney:,"I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.
"
5,16,215,Robin:,"Why change your mind?
"
5,16,216,Barney:,"The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!
"
5,17,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, during a warm evening in March 2010, the New York police rescued a 34 year old man from the Hudson River... your Uncle Barney.
"
5,17,2,Police:,"Okay, big guy, tell me all along.
"
5,17,3,Barney:,"It all started a week ago.
"
5,17,4,Barney:,"I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.
"
5,17,5,Woman:,"Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.
"
5,17,6,Barney:,"Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.
"
5,17,7,Woman:,"But this is merely a tie.
"
5,17,8,Barney:,"It was not my best tie.
"
5,17,9,Police:,"Right.
"
5,17,10,Barney:,"So, right after that, I took her home.
"
5,17,11,Woman:,"When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.
"
5,17,12,Barney:,"Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.
"
5,17,13,Woman:,"Good night.
"
5,17,14,Barney:,"What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.
"
5,17,15,Robin:,"I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work.
"
5,17,16,Don:,"Thanks to this young woman to my left. This report on how rodent avoided in the subway...
"
5,17,17,Robin:,"The answer might surprise you. It's all rodents.
"
5,17,18,Don:,"I gotta go, okay? See you soon.
"
5,17,19,Marshall:,"Nice to meet you.
"
5,17,20,Don:,"I do too.
"
5,17,21,Marshall:,"This guy is awesome. It's funny, smart, beautiful. You have him to nab it before someone else.
"
5,17,22,Robin:,"I hope you do not talk to you.
"
5,17,23,Lily:,"It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.
"
5,17,24,Marshall:,"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.
"
5,17,25,Barney:,"I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.
"
5,17,26,Ted:,"It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word ""s*x""?
"
5,17,27,Woman:,"I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really s*x, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.
"
5,17,28,Barney:,"Continuous. Continues.
"
5,17,29,Ted:,"Did she used an excuse for physical contact?
"
5,17,30,Woman:,"It's the cashmere?
"
5,17,31,Barney:,"Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.
"
5,17,32,Female:,"12 microns. I like the tight fibers.
"
5,17,33,Barney:,"Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.
"
5,17,34,Barney:,"She did it too!
"
5,17,35,Ted:,"And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, ""I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? ""
"
5,17,36,Barney:,"You try this sh1t of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.
"
5,17,37,Woman:,"It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.
"
5,17,38,Barney:,"Did you just say you got a kid!
"
5,17,39,Woman:,"You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.
"
5,17,40,Barney:,"Completely.
"
5,17,41,Woman:,"Or the second. Or the third.
"
5,17,42,Barney:,"Of course. Well...
"
5,17,43,Woman:,"Or the fourth.
"
5,17,44,Barney:,"Just tell me how!
"
5,17,45,Female:,"17.
"
5,17,46,Barney:,"Excuse me, someone is using this stool?
"
5,17,47,Ted:,"That is: no s*x before hot date 17th.
"
5,17,48,Lily:,"If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.
"
5,17,49,Barney:,"I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...
"
5,17,50,Ted:,"From Robin is Robin.
"
5,17,51,Barney:,"I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.
"
5,17,52,Don:,"Listen... You wanna go out on Saturday night?
"
5,17,53,Robin:,"Saturday night?
"
5,17,54,Marshall:,"It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes!
"
5,17,55,Robin:,"Don... Listen, it's... it's really nice of you, and you're really great...
"
5,17,56,"Marshall, with the phone in the kitchen:","Yes, I'm going out with you.
"
5,17,57,Don:,"Robin, you okay?
"
5,17,58,Marshall:,"I just have a cold. That's why for my voice. (She goes into the kitchen and tries to pick up the phone) But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.
"
5,17,59,Robin:,"But what are you doing?
"
5,17,60,Marshall:,"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.
"
5,17,61,Barney:,"I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.
"
5,17,62,Lily:,"That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect.
"
5,17,63,Robin:,"Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested.
"
5,17,64,Lily:,"You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?
"
5,17,65,Robin:,"It was my show.
"
5,17,66,Robin:,"But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...
"
5,17,67,Anita:,"I would summarize in one, Robin. And that word is ""no.""By saying no constantly and consistently, it gives a power, simultaneously transforming any fool in human wreck, subject, and whining.
"
5,17,68,Robin:,"Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.
"
5,17,69,Mike:,"It's good. You want a coffee?
"
5,17,70,Robin:,"Absolutely, Mike, great idea.
"
5,17,71,Mike:,"You?
"
5,17,72,Anita:,"No. And you, Robin? You go out with someone?
"
5,17,73,Robin:,"I have not really want right now.
"
5,17,74,Anita:,"You were broken heart?
"
5,17,75,Robin:,"And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said...
"
5,17,76,Anita:,"That Barney needs a lesson. Give me the order, and I will destroy it.
"
5,17,77,Robin:,"That's to say?
"
5,17,78,Anita:,"I will use the power of ""no"" to destroy your friend Barney.Say it.
"
5,17,79,Robin:,"Come on, it does not really work, though?
"
5,17,80,Mike:,"I knew not what you wanted when I caught you a cappuccino, espresso, latte, decaf... and a Turkish coffee.
"
5,17,81,Anita:,"Thank you, Mike. Think about it.
"
5,17,82,Robin:,"I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.
"
5,17,83,Barney:,"This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. (Robin phone) I put on the StairMaster and...
"
5,17,84,Robin:,"It does.
"
5,17,85,Barney:,"Spoilers. Regardless, we did.
"
5,17,86,Anita:,"It's done. (Mike brings a drink to Anita) Thank you, Mike.
"
5,17,87,Robin:,"I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the shooting range.
"
5,17,88,Lily:,"I hope this was not the same nights.
"
5,17,89,Robin:,"Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.
"
5,17,90,Marshall:,"You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break.
"
5,17,91,Lily:,"You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes.
"
5,17,92,Marshall:,"She cried? Real tears? It means...
"
5,17,93,Ted (2030):,"Marshall understood what he had been con with Robin.
"
5,17,94,Marshall:,"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. You see, this guy has been very active. Sexually. Finally, it is like that... bang... bang... bang... You see? It's like... bang... bang...
"
5,17,95,Marshall:,"How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public.
"
5,17,96,Lily:,"I know, but the song is rather catchy.
"
5,17,97,Barney:,"sh1t. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?
"
5,17,98,Ted:,"There is another option... but you're not ready.
"
5,17,99,Barney:,"Tell me.
"
5,17,100,Ted:,"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.
"
5,17,101,Barney:,"A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?
"
5,17,102,Ted:,"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.
"
5,17,103,Barney:,"Okay.
"
5,17,104,Ted:,"Let me do it. I will plan everything.
"
5,17,105,Barney:,"You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?
"
5,17,106,Ted:,"Cutesy and romantic? (He starts singing) No need to take him to Paris or Peru...
"
5,17,107,Barney:,"What are you doing?
"
5,17,108,Ted singing:,"You just gotta make him understand...
"
5,17,109,Barney:,"They look at us.
"
5,17,110,Ted:,"How important it is for you...
"
5,17,111,Barney:,"Really? You really gonna do that?
"
5,17,112,"Ted, still singing:","In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.
"
5,17,113,Barney:,"It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?
"
5,17,114,Ted:,"Box strip.
"
5,17,115,Ted (2030):,"Finally, the night of the great rencards arrived.
"
5,17,116,Marshall:,"Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better.
"
5,17,117,Robin:,"I just... I canceled.
"
5,17,118,Marshall:,"How does it... Wait.
"
5,17,119,Lily:,"A problem?
"
5,17,120,Marshall:,"Robin canceled his hot date.
"
5,17,121,Ted:,"What? She was super excited there is one hour.
"
5,17,122,Ted:,"You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.
"
5,17,123,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
5,17,124,Ted:,"You're excited to go out with Don?
"
5,17,125,Robin:,"You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall.
"
5,17,126,Ted:,"I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at ""Tombeur panties."" They call it a super hot date.
"
5,17,127,Marshall:,"Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning!
"
5,17,128,Ted:,"She seemed happy after the break.
"
5,17,129,Marshall:,"You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated.
"
5,17,130,Ted:,"Wait, but that would mean...
"
5,17,131,Ted (2030):,"And I understood what I had been con with Robin.
"
5,17,132,Ted:,"You sing what?
"
5,17,133,Marshall:,"A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently.
"
5,17,134,Ted:,"I'll sing a verse.
"
5,17,135,Marshall:,"Super.
"
5,17,136,Ted:,"Where is she?
"
5,17,137,Marshall:,"I think it is the toilet.
"
5,17,138,Robin:,"I'm fine, I'm fine.
"
5,17,139,Barney:,"Why did you do that?
"
5,17,140,Marshall:,"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.
"
5,17,141,Barney:,"Why are you angry against me?
"
5,17,142,Ted:,"You were a real asshole to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.
"
5,17,143,Barney:,"The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.
"
5,17,144,Ted:,"You see nothing.
"
5,17,145,Marshall:,"Typical of a guy.
"
5,17,146,Lily:,"Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.
"
5,17,147,Barney:,"What, she is upset?
"
5,17,148,Lily:,"Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail.
"
5,17,149,Ted (2030):,"Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.
"
5,17,150,Barney:,"You should have seen.
"
5,17,151,Robin:,"I'm going.
"
5,17,152,Barney:,"We go back home...
"
5,17,153,Barney:,"I can not believe that Robin is upset.
"
5,17,154,Marshall:,"And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.
"
5,17,155,Barney:,"I did worse after the premiere of ""The Phantom Menace.""It's been like that since we broke up?
"
5,17,156,Lily:,"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.
"
5,17,157,Barney:,"I know where.
"
5,17,158,Robin:,"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.
"
5,17,159,Barney:,"I know you're upset.
"
5,17,160,Robin:,"What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.
"
5,17,161,Barney:,"You sure you're not upset?
"
5,17,162,Robin:,"Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?
"
5,17,163,Barney:,"You're not another number for me.
"
5,17,164,Robin:,"And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.
"
5,17,165,Barney:,"I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?
"
5,17,166,Robin:,"Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.
"
5,17,167,Barney:,"Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.
"
5,17,168,Robin:,"Do not sleep with Anita.
"
5,17,169,Barney:,"I promise.
"
5,17,170,Robin:,"Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?
"
5,17,171,Barney:,"It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.
"
5,17,172,Ted (2030):,"Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.
"
5,17,173,Barney:,"I wanted to call you.
"
5,17,174,Anita:,"I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?
"
5,17,175,Barney:,"I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.
"
5,17,176,Anita:,"I see. You try the trick of ""no."" You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.
"
5,17,177,Barney:,"No.
"
5,17,178,Anita:,"The 11th?
"
5,17,179,Barney:,"No.
"
5,17,180,Anita:,"The fifth?
"
5,17,181,Barney:,"No.
"
5,17,182,Anita:,"Tonight?
"
5,17,183,Barney:,"No.
"
5,17,184,Anita:,"This evening before dinner?
"
5,17,185,Barney:,"No.
"
5,17,186,"Anita, Ted:","And you? You're interested.
"
5,17,187,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
5,17,188,Anita:,"Go.
"
5,17,189,Barney:,"I'm sorry. The answer is no.
"
5,17,190,Anita:,"Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer.
"
5,17,191,Barney:,"Here is my story.
"
5,17,192,Police:,"This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.
"
5,17,193,Barney:,"I hope so too.
"
5,17,194,Ted:,"This is an old story of married women.
"
5,17,195,Marshall:,"How was this date?
"
5,17,196,Robin:,"Good enough. Pretty... pretty good.
"
5,17,197,Ted:,"How so?
"
5,17,198,Robin:,"Come on, guys. It was good. It was nice. We spent a pleasant evening. Let... Let him that. Even if...
"
5,3,1,Ted (2030):,"Kids, your uncle Barney had been called a lot of names over the years.
"
5,3,2,Girl 1:,"(throwing her glass to his face) Jerk!
"
5,3,3,Girl 2:,"(throwing her glass to his face) b*st*rd!
"
5,3,4,Girl 3:,"Barack Obama Jr.?!
"
5,3,5,Barney:,"Mm-hmm. And yes... we can.
"
5,3,6,Ted (2030):,"But there's one name none of us ever expected to hear him called.
"
5,3,7,Robin:,"Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say.
"
5,3,8,Ted:,"Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.
"
5,3,9,Lily:,"But other than that, things are good?
"
5,3,10,Ted:,"Bowl. Bowl.
"
5,3,11,Robin:,"I don't know. I think Barney's been single for too long.
"
5,3,12,Ted:,"Bowl.
"
5,3,13,Robin:,"Like, the other night, I wake up at 4:00 a.m
"
5,3,14,Ted:,"Bowl.
"
5,3,15,Robin:,"Barney, are you awake? Barney?
"
5,3,16,Robin:,"Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed.
"
5,3,17,Ted:,"Bowl.
"
5,3,18,Robin:,"That's happened three times.
"
5,3,19,Ted:,"Bowl.
"
5,3,20,Robin:,"And it's not just that, it's other things.
"
5,3,21,Barney:,"Hey. What's wrong?
"
5,3,22,Robin:,"(crying) It was just one thing after another at work today, and then... (sniffling) I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just...
"
5,3,23,Barney:,"Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.
"
5,3,24,Robin:,"Oh, thanks.
"
5,3,25,Barney:,"And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have s*x. Mm-kay?
"
5,3,26,Ted:,"Bowl.
"
5,3,27,Robin:,"Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est person in the world, but... a little more effort would be nice.
"
5,3,28,Ted:,"Bowl. Bowl.
"
5,3,29,Robin:,"I understand.
"
5,3,30,Ted:,"Bowl.
"
5,3,31,Lily:,"I guess, in a lot of ways, Barney doesn't stack up.
"
5,3,32,Ted:,"Bowl. Bowl.
"
5,3,33,Lily:,"I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends.
"
5,3,34,Ted:,"(at various pitches) Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.
"
5,3,35,Robin:,"No, that's not it.
"
5,3,36,Ted:,"Bowl.
"
5,3,37,Robin:,"I don't know.
"
5,3,38,Ted:,"Bowl
"
5,3,39,Robin:,"Maybe he just doesn't have it in him.
"
5,3,40,Ted:,"Bowl. Bowl.
"
5,3,41,Robin:,"Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake.
"
5,3,42,Ted:,"Bowl?
"
5,3,43,Barney:,"She really said that?
"
5,3,44,Ted:,"And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present.
"
5,3,45,Barney:,"Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--
"
5,3,46,Ted:,"Mm-hmm.
"
5,3,47,Barney:,"I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!
"
5,3,48,Ted (2030):,"But then a funny thing happened. Over the next couple weeks, Barney was thoughtful, considerate, sweet. In short, the perfect boyfriend. Which, to Robin, meant only one thing.
"
5,3,49,Robin:,"He's cheating on me.
"
5,3,50,Lily:,"What?!
"
5,3,51,Robin:,"Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side.
"
5,3,52,Lily:,"Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.
"
5,3,53,Robin:,"Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.
"
5,3,54,Lily:,"Well, that doesn't prove anything.
"
5,3,55,Robin:,"Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. (taking Barney's briefcase).
"
5,3,56,Lily:,"And what do you plan on doing with it?
"
5,3,57,Robin:,"We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.
"
5,3,58,Lily:,"No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things: friend, confidant, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target. But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch. (snatching the briefcase) Let go.
"
5,3,59,Marshall:,"Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.
"
5,3,60,Robin:,"There's a basement storage area?
"
5,3,61,Marshall:,"Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found.
"
5,3,62,Lily:,"Oh, that's great, honey.
"
5,3,63,Robin:,"What the hell is that?
"
5,3,64,Lily:,"Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years.
"
5,3,65,Marshall:,"Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin
"
5,3,66,Robin:,"(slowly) Barrel resin?
"
5,3,67,Lily:,"Just go with it.
"
5,3,68,Robin:,"So you need a hand throwing it out?
"
5,3,69,Marshall:,"No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.
"
5,3,70,Robin:,"So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?
"
5,3,71,Marshall:,"I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?
"
5,3,72,Robin:,"Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.
"
5,3,73,Marshall:,"Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle.
"
5,3,74,Ted ( 2030):,"The Bermuda Triangle was the name we'd given years earlier to the curb right in front of our building. Whenever we wanted to give something away, we'd put it right there. It was uncanny.
"
5,3,75,Marshall:,"This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel.
"
5,3,76,Robin:,"Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here.
"
5,3,77,Lily:,"(to Robin) Be cool, baby. Damn! (toMarshall who is leaving with his barrel) See you, sweetie. Good luck.
"
5,3,78,Marshall:,"Bye, babe.
"
5,3,79,Lily:,"Now, can we please get out of here?
"
5,3,80,Robin:,"Yeah. I'll grab my coat.
"
5,3,81,Robin:,"Oops.
"
5,3,82,Lily:,"A college notebook?!
"
5,3,83,Robin:,"Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb.(reading the notebook) ""Birthday: July 23.Favorite hockey team: the Vancouver Canucks. Age: 29, but tells people that she's 26."" Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me.
"
5,3,84,Marshall:,"I hope I'm not too late! I want to see the look of joy on the new owner's face!
"
5,3,85,Marshall:,"She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he... he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight?
"
5,3,86,Lily:,"What do you know about this,Marshall?
"
5,3,87,Robin:,"Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me?
"
5,3,88,Marshall:,"Well...
"
5,3,89,Ted (2030):,"The truth was...Barney was taking a night school class taught... by me.
"
5,3,90,Ted:,"Welcome to Robin 101.
"
5,3,91,Robin:,"Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago.
"
5,3,92,Barney:,"...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!
"
5,3,93,Barney:,"Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about?
"
5,3,94,Ted:,"Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.
"
5,3,95,Barney:,"Okay.
"
5,3,96,Ted:,"And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times.
"
5,3,97,Robin:,"Hey, guys. What you talking about?
"
5,3,98,Barney and Ted:,"Fantasy football.
"
5,3,99,Marshall:,"They realized they couldn't talk about this stuff at the bar, and since you live with Ted, they had to find someplace safe. So... Ted's classroom.

"
5,3,104,Ted:,"We did that ready.
"
5,3,105,Barney:," No, like, really big boobs.
"
5,3,106,Ted:,"No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me.
"
5,3,107,Barney:,"Can we have class outside?
"
5,3,108,Ted:,"No! What Robin really wants deep down...
"
5,3,109,Ted:,"Barney!
"
5,3,110,Barney:,"What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah- ""H's"" or no?
"
5,3,111,Ted:,"Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?
"
5,3,112,Barney:,"They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside?
"
5,3,113,Ted:,"Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?
"
5,3,114,Barney:,"Do you think I should get Sports Illustrated for 70% off the cover price? Can we have class outside? I got to find a way to reach this kid.

5,3,119,Ted:,"Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...
"
5,3,120,Barney:,"Okay.
"
5,3,121,Ted:,"This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter. (changing the photo) Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?
"
5,3,122,Barney:,"That's a building.
"
5,3,123,Ted:,"Oh... (chuckling) That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...

5,3,125,Ted:,"Right. The most important facial expression of all.
"
5,3,126,Barney:,"Whoa...
"
5,3,127,Ted:,"Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point: defusing the bomb.

5,3,159,Barney:,"Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything.
"
5,3,160,Ted:,"Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say.
"
5,3,161,Barney:,"Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor? (showing is thumb down) Or should I turn it up for you? (he turns it up).
"
5,3,162,Ted (2030):,"It may not have been a thumbs-up, kids.
"
5,3,163,Ted:,"Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz.
"
5,3,164,Barney:,"What...
"
5,3,165,Ted:,"When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her?
"
5,3,166,Barney:,"Trick question. Get her butterscotch.
"
5,3,167,Ted:,"Correct! Why?
"
5,3,168,Barney:,"Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women.
"
5,3,169,Ted:,"Correct! What is Robin's dream job?
"
5,3,170,Barney:,"To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time.
"
5,3,171,Ted:,"Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?
"
5,3,172,Barney:,"No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: ""Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?""
"
5,3,173,Ted:,"Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.
"
5,3,174,Barney:,"""Oh, Captain! My Captain!""
"
5,3,175,Ted:,"How good was Dead Poet's Society?
"
5,3,176,Barney:,"I know, right? The end? Tears.
"
5,3,177,Robin:,"(closing the book) Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, ""I am proud of you, eh?""
"
5,3,178,Marshall:,"So why are you crying now?
"
5,3,179,Robin:,"I'm not crying.
"
5,3,180,Lily:,"(hugging her) Oh, sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch?
"
5,3,181,Robin:,"Oh, stop it.
"
5,3,182,Robin:,"Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.
"
5,3,183,Lily:,"So?
"
5,3,184,Robin:,"That's right now.
"
5,3,185,Ted:,"Now, as you can see, well over 50% of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Robin Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions?
"
5,3,186,Robin:,"Yeah, I have one.
"
5,3,187,Ted:,"Yes, Robin?
"
5,3,188,Ted:,"(to barney) Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh.
"
5,3,189,Barney:,"I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?
"
5,3,190,Robin:,"What the hell do you two think you're doing?
"
5,3,191,Barney:,"Marshall, did you sells out?
"
5,3,192,Marshall:,"I was vulnerable, I said good-bye to a very dear friend today.
"
5,3,193,Robin:,"Dude, it's a barrel!
"
5,3,194,Ted:,"Aw! You're giving Mabel away?
"
5,3,195,Robin:,"I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? (showing a guy in the classroom).
"
5,3,196,Ted:,"Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.
"
5,3,197,Robin:,"""Auditing""?
"
5,3,198,Ted:,"Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.
"
5,3,199,Barney:,"On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.
"
5,3,200,Robin:,"Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?
"
5,3,201,Shin-Ya:,"(speaking Chinese) They made me wear a wig, It was very demeaning.
"
5,3,202,Robin:,"You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?
"
5,3,203,Barney:,"Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!
"
5,3,204,Lily:,"(sneezing): Kiss ass.
"
5,3,205,Robin:,"You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.
"
5,3,206,Ted:,"Uh, really? Name one wrong thing.
"
5,3,207,Robin:,"""Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones""? Let me clear something up for you, Ted.
"
5,3,208,Ted:,"Does lefty like that?
"
5,3,209,Robin:," (embarassed) Oh. Yeah...
"
5,3,210,Ted:,"Don't wanna leave out the righty.
"
5,3,211,Robin:,"Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.
"
5,3,212,Ted:,"Noted.
"
5,3,213,Ted:,"That was a lie?
"
5,3,214,Robin:,"We had just started dating. I was being nice.
"
5,3,215,Robin:,"(to Barney) And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.
"
5,3,216,Barney:,"That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.
"
5,3,217,Robin:,"You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.
"
5,3,218,Robin:,"What do you want?
"
5,3,219,Ted:,"Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.
"
5,3,220,Robin:,"I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.
"
5,3,221,Ted:,"It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?
"
5,3,222,Robin:,"Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?
"
5,3,223,Ted:,"I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.
"
5,3,224,Barney:,"Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook. (he throws it on the barrel) But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small
"
5,3,225,Robin:,"You're an idiot.
"
5,3,226,Robin:,"You know...
"
5,3,227,Barney:,"Hmm?
"
5,3,228,Robin:,"That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.
"
5,3,229,Barney:,"And your work address.
"
5,3,230,Barney:,"Whoa.
"
5,3,231,Marsahll:,"(upstais, lookin gout the window) Hey, guys! If you don't want the barrel, can you sit somewhere else? You're scaring away potential takers.
"
5,3,232,Ted:,"Designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind...
"
5,3,233,Student:,"Uh, Professor Mosby?
"
5,3,234,Ted:,"Yes, Susan?
"
5,3,235,Student:,"That's a woman drinking beer on the toilet.
"
5,3,236,Ted:,"Right. That-That... was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on.
"
5,7,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, since I know your Uncle Barney, he has always had strong views on relationships.
"
5,7,2,Barney:,"Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted.
"
5,7,3,Ted (2030):,"And yet, in fall 2009, it was he who had a girlfriend.
"
5,7,4,Barney:,"Come on. Open it. It's p0rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.
"
5,7,5,Ted:,"It's your p0rn collection.
"
5,7,6,Barney:,"This is my collection of p0rn! I offer you my p0rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more.
"
5,7,7,Lily:,"Voluntarily, you abandon your p0rn...? You're really serious.
"
5,7,8,Marshall:,"This is obvious.
"
5,7,9,Barney:,"What does that mean?
"
5,7,10,Marshall:,"Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.
"
5,7,11,Barney:,"What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.
"
5,7,12,Marshall:,"It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there.
"
5,7,13,Lily:,"He really is growing at a time.
"
5,7,14,Barney:,"We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you.
"
5,7,15,Robin:,"He speaks to p0rn.
"
5,7,16,Ted:,"Hi, Robin. A more.
"
5,7,17,Robin:,"Hi.
"
5,7,18,Lily:,"My God, matte videos. The orgy of space? The surprise party of 23 students naughty?
"
5,7,19,Marshall:,"You'd think after 22 celebrations, students would no longer surprises.
"
5,7,20,Lily:,"You can get rid of it.
"
5,7,21,Ted:,"No, it's not a problem. I'll do it.
"
5,7,22,Lily:,"Are you sure? It's nothing. We can go around back and throw the box in the trash.
"
5,7,23,Marshall:,"I read six of the words you just said about this jacket.
"
5,7,24,Ted:,"Seriously, this is nothing. I'm on it.
"
5,7,25,Lily:,"Because...
"
5,7,26,Ted:,"Let them! In a sense, it's sad, right? Barney who abandons his p0rn. He has love handles. They eat the same thing every night. We are witnessing the end of Barney Stinson as we know it.
"
5,7,27,Marshall:,"So what? They are happy.
"
5,7,28,Lily:,"Let's go. A more.
"
5,7,29,Marshall:,"So you're what?
"
5,7,30,Lily:,"I Tail-Dalle.
"
5,7,31,Marshall:,"What...? I thought I had seen in one take.
"
5,7,32,Lily:,"Yeah. It's called Tail-Dalle.
"
5,7,33,Ted:,"ArchiSexTure. That's not how you write ""Buckminster Fuller.""
"
5,7,34,Ted (2030):,"Children, pornography is wrong, and when I got rid of that horrible pornography on the field...
"
5,7,35,Ted:,"I get rid of this horrible pornography on the field.
"
5,7,36,Ted (2030):,"There is something terrible happened.
"
5,7,37,Voice:,"ArchiSexture.
"
5,7,38,Barney:,"If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p0rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!
"
5,7,39,Barney:,"I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy. (Marshall and Lily have joined Ted) Out of pity, if our best friends account... And yes, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how you take it? So, get me out of here. And finally, since you hoping to see some p0rn... (Barney turns the camera towards the bed where a woman waits) Do not worry. The green light means it is off.
"
5,7,40,Lily:,"We're sure he had done?
"
5,7,41,Ted:,"There is no reason to take it seriously, though?
"
5,7,42,Lily:,"No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin.
"
5,7,43,Ted (2030):,"But over time I began to notice things. Barney and Robin have stopped their crazy adventures.
"
5,7,44,Lily:,"So what you did last night?
"
5,7,45,Robin:,"I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable.
"
5,7,46,Barney:,"It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun.
"
5,7,47,Ted (2030):,"Barney stopped being himself.
"
5,7,48,Ted:,"I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.
"
5,7,49,Barney:,"Sorry, I have my own way tonight.
"
5,7,50,Ted (2030):,"And Robin was annoyed when he opened his mouth.
"
5,7,51,Lily:,"How do you go?
"
5,7,52,Barney:,"Super. Relations are deadly...
"
5,7,53,Robin:,"Shut up...
"
5,7,54,Barney:,"Exchanges and compromise...
"
5,7,55,Robin:,"Shut up...
"
5,7,56,Barney:,"Monogamy is the best.
"
5,7,57,Robin:,"Shut up.
"
5,7,58,Barney:,"Tagline!
"
5,7,59,Robin:,"Shut up.
"
5,7,60,Ted (2030):,"But it got worse... more
"
5,7,61,Barney:,"More hungry...
"
5,7,62,Ted (2030):,"The more they said everything was fine. In truth, Barney and Robin had just let go. But after a few weeks for us, they looked like that.
"
5,7,63,Barney:,"I can... in a minute.
"
5,7,64,Ted:,"They kill.
"
5,7,65,Lily:,"They love each other.
"
5,7,66,Ted:,"Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old.
"
5,7,67,Marshall:,"My favorite cop show.
"
5,7,68,Ted:,"This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney.
"
5,7,69,Lily:,"They are perfect together.
"
5,7,70,Ted:,"It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.
"
5,7,71,Marshall:,"We are two dominant sets.
"
5,7,72,Lily:,"Of course, my heart.
"
5,7,73,Marshall:,"If they are not happy, why not break?
"
5,7,74,Ted:,"They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.
"
5,7,75,Marshall:,"I think the first who plays Barney deflates.
"
5,7,76,Lily:,"It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say ""selfish"" nicely?
"
5,7,77,Lily:,"Independents. Every relationship goes through there.
"
5,7,78,Marshall:,"It's true... I had a friend astronaut, totally in love with his fiancee. On the eve of her mission, she surprised him with four other girls and two guys. It has become intense. She ended up sneaking into the space shuttle...
"
5,7,79,Ted:,"Talk about Space Orgy?
"
5,7,80,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
5,7,81,Lily:,"It's a bad time. Let us do things.
"
5,7,82,Marshall:,"She's right.
"
5,7,83,Lily:,"Two against one, Ted. Let them.
"
5,7,84,Ted (2030):,"I left them alone. But this weekend there...
"
5,7,85,Barney:,"Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?
"
5,7,86,Marshall:,"I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?
"
5,7,87,Barney:,"Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!
"
5,7,88,Marshall:,"So you're happy?
"
5,7,89,Barney:,"Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, ""Every moment is a battle.""
"
5,7,90,Marshall:,"So you're happy?
"
5,7,91,Barney:,"And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.
"
5,7,92,Barney:,"Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan.
"
5,7,93,Robin:,"Okay. Decides that the piece.
"
5,7,94,Barney:,"What was the pizza again?
"
5,7,95,Robin:,"Face.
"
5,7,96,Barney:,"It's face.
"
5,7,97,Barney:,"s*x... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?
"
5,7,98,Marshall:,"We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break.
"
5,7,99,Ted:,"What next?
"
5,7,100,Marshall:,"We will release... the Kraken.
"
5,7,101,Ted (2030):,"Children, as you know, earlier this year I learned that Lily had broken no one, not two, but seven of my past relationships.
"
5,7,102,Lily:,"Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer.
"
5,7,103,Marshall:,"But you're the best.
"
5,7,104,Lily:,"I swear, I gave up these shots there. I became legit. I am now matchmaker.
"
5,7,105,Ted:,"Find me someone.
"
5,7,106,Lily:,"I just started.
"
5,7,107,Marshall:,"Please. You've got to break. This relationship is killing them.
"
5,7,108,Lily:,"I know, but I learned the lesson. I no longer interferes. I let things.
"
5,7,109,Ted:,"It's two against one.
"
5,7,110,Lily:,"But the one that's me.
"
5,7,111,Ted:,"No need for it. We can do it alone.
"
5,7,112,Marshall:,"How?
"
5,7,113,Ted:,"When I was with Robin, you remember the only thing that made pinball?
"
5,7,114,Robin:,"You do not have the right to do this to me.
"
5,7,115,Ted:,"What are you talking?
"
5,7,116,Robin:,"From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne?
"
5,7,117,Ted:,"If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break.
"
5,7,118,Marshall:,"That sucks. Why not let Barney be tempted by a sexy girl? (Barney wipes his hands on his shirt) Okay, going to the ring.
"
5,7,119,Marshall:,"A surveillance van.
"
5,7,120,Ted:,"What?
"
5,7,121,Marshall:,"It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, ""That's not why I signed,"" or stuff like that.
"
5,7,122,Ted:,"The server arrives.
"
5,7,123,Robin:,"Please, shut up.
"
5,7,124,Barney:,"What?
"
5,7,125,Robin:,"I thought you had mentioned, sorry. (The waiter brings them two glasses of champagne) This is an engagement ring?Are you...?
"
5,7,126,Barney:,"No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?
"
5,7,127,Robin:,"We're committed to one another.
"
5,7,128,Barney:,"Your business is already in my apartment.
"
5,7,129,Robin:,"Easier for taxes.
"
5,7,130,Barney:,"And for your naturalization.
"
5,7,131,Robin:,"""Scherbatsky"" is hard to spell.
"
5,7,132,Barney:,"My mother would be so happy.
"
5,7,133,Robin:,"Yeah, I guess.
"
5,7,134,Barney:,"No reason not to do so.
"
5,7,135,Barney:,"We get married!
"
5,7,136,Robin:,"Not so loud, sh1t.
"
5,7,137,Lily:,"What did you do? I'm furious now. It will not?
"
5,7,138,Robin:,"You will be my bridesmaid?
"
5,7,139,Lily:,"Oh, my God! I'd love to!
"
5,7,140,Lily:,"You have lost your mind? You knew they were playing that first deflates, and what? You give them an engagement ring!Okay, that's good. I care. I return to the center stage for a final rupture.
"
5,7,141,Marshall:,"What next?
"
5,7,142,Lily:,"They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends.
"
5,7,143,Robin:,"You do not know any that girl over there?
"
5,7,144,Barney:,"No, I do not think. (The woman bends down to pick something she brought down) No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?
"
5,7,145,Robin:,"Really?
"
5,7,146,Lily:,"Number three, the altercation Star Wars.
"
5,7,147,Robin:,"You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?
"
5,7,148,Barney:,"It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper.
"
5,7,149,Robin:,"He wears a diaper.
"
5,7,150,Barney:,"No, it's protective armor.
"
5,7,151,Robin:,"A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.
"
5,7,152,Barney:,"Come on.
"
5,7,153,Robin:,"It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.
"
5,7,154,Barney:,"You know, I'm sick.
"
5,7,155,Robin:,"I said nothing.
"
5,7,156,Barney:,"The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper...
"
5,7,157,Lily:,"And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American War.
"
5,7,158,Barney:,"thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang?
"
5,7,159,Robin:,"You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.
"
5,7,160,Barney:,"She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?
"
5,7,161,Robin:,"Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young.
"
5,7,162,Barney:,"I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord...
"
5,7,163,Ted:,"I've found. I have found. They maile images reminding those fights.
"
5,7,164,Lily:,"Poor kid. This is how it will happen. They are the restau... (Lily imagines the scene) First, it rekindles debate US-Canada, when Alan Thicke, a native of Ontario, going to their table.
"
5,7,165,Ted:,"Alan Thicke?
"
5,7,166,Marshall:,"Oh yes. Robin was known when she sang.
"
5,7,167,Lily:,"They are always in contact. I had his number on the mobile Robin. Seriously... amateurs. (She plunges into the scene) So, Alan Thicke stimulus battle USA / Canada. Just then, Meg-the-crazy happens. Then, a stormtrooper happening in the street.And just when they are tired, a diver passes with a basin full of what? Dirty dishes.
"
5,7,168,Ted:,"This is your masterpiece.
"
5,7,169,Marshall:,"It takes a surveillance van!
"
5,7,170,Marshall:,"A Break? Really? You have rented a station wagon?
"
5,7,171,Ted:,"A van costs $ 25 more.
"
5,7,172,Marshall:,"A Break?
"
5,7,173,Robot:,"Greeting, Will Robinson! That a birthday?
"
5,7,174,Lily:,"Get in the car.
"
5,7,175,Ted:,"What is that thing?
"
5,7,176,Lily:,"They did not stormtrooper so I had to take another robot. It will work also.
"
5,7,177,Ted:,"Another robot? The stormtroopers are not robots.
"
5,7,178,Lily:,"Of course they are robots! ""Must kill Luke Skywalker""
"
5,7,179,Ted:,"No one said this in Star Wars.
"
5,7,180,Marshall:,"Very bad robot voice.
"
5,7,181,Man:,"Someone ordered an extra large sausage?
"
5,7,182,Ted:,"A film of Barney begins like that.
"
5,7,183,Marshall:,"Barney Five... order something.
"
5,7,184,Man:,"I do not know if everything will be back.
"
5,7,185,Ted:,"Now you mention the movie.
"
5,7,186,Marshall:,"It continues. The server supports a second sheet.
"
5,7,187,Lily:,"We need it here. It is in hiding.
"
5,7,188,Man:,"You dont need a van?
"
5,7,189,Ted:,"A van is more expensive.
"
5,7,190,Marshall:,"Thank you!
"
5,7,191,Robot:,"Pass me a slice, Will Robinson!
"
5,7,192,Ted:,"If you work the costume, they will pay us.
"
5,7,193,Marshall:,"Stop and think only of money.
"
5,7,194,Lily:,"Give a hand to the stormtrooper.
"
5,7,195,Ted and Marshall:,"It's not a stormtrooper.
"
5,7,196,Man 2:,"Sorry for the delay. I was looking for a van.
"
5,7,197,Marshall:,"Thank you!
"
5,7,198,Ted:,"$ 25!
"
5,7,199,Man 2:,"I greet between Robin?
"
5,7,200,Lily:,"No, go up. Wait... When they blew the Death Star with thousands of stormtroopers it was human?
"
5,7,201,Marshall:,"It was the Death Star. They did not sign in the wind.
"
5,7,202,Man 2:,"I do not want to play with celebrities, but I have a dinner tonight, so...
"
5,7,203,Man:,"Someone should take this sausage!
"
5,7,204,Ted:,"You were in this video? The guy with the tan of a farmer?
"
5,7,205,Robot:,"Many want pizza, Will Robinson!
"
5,7,206,Man 2:,"Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!
"
5,7,207,Man:,"That's not why I signed.
"
5,7,208,Lily:,"You know what? Everyone, stop! Alan thicke, close it!Marshall is a break. Put-in-t. Ted, stop talking about p0rn. And for God's sake, give the pizza stormtrooper!
"
5,7,209,Ted and Marshall:,"It's not a stormtrooper!
"
5,7,210,Lily:,"Damn! They see us.
"
5,7,211,Marshall:,"You're sure they've seen us?
"
5,7,212,Woman:,"I can go talk to Barney? I'm too excited. You really think he'll ask me to marry?
"
5,7,213,Marshall:,"Forget it is located. If you try something, they'll know it's us. We should all go...
"
5,7,214,Lily:,"This is my masterpiece. And then they saw us? It will work anyway.
"
5,7,215,Ted:,"Come on. We find something else.
"
5,7,216,Alan:,"I repeat, I'm Alan Thicke.
"
5,7,217,Woman:,"You are Alan Thicke?
"
5,7,218,Lily:,"Alan Thicke, to you. Go ahead.
"
5,7,219,Ted (2030):,"So Lily went on with his plan. First, Alan Thicke.Followed by Meg-the-wild. Then the robot. And finally, the dirty dishes. But after all that...
"
5,7,220,Lily:,"They kiss? They should not! Why it does not work?
"
5,7,221,Ted:,"Because they love.
"
5,7,222,Marshall:,"It was a bad spot.
"
5,7,223,Lily:,"What am I doing? All this was a mistake.
"
5,7,224,Robot:,"So... it tells you to smoke joints?
"
5,7,225,Ted:,"I thought that I would not say that this coir, but... Robin and Barney, the happy couple.
"
5,7,226,Ted (2030):,"This is when we learned that relationships are hard but ultimately, everything comes right.
"
5,7,227,Lily:,"Where is Barney?
"
5,7,228,Robin:,"It was broken.
"
5,7,229,Ted (2030):,"And that's when we have forgotten the lesson they had learned ten seconds.
"
5,7,230,Ted (2030):,"You see, rather in the evening, when Lily was believed that Barney and Robin had spotted us, this is what they really saw.
"
5,7,231,"Barney, seeing himself in the window of the restaurant:","Why this big and this old will not stop us... It's us!
"
5,7,232,Robin:,"Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?
"
5,7,233,Barney:,"I'm not happy. Finally, I would be. Nothing would make me happier than to be happy, but... I'm not.
"
5,7,234,Robin:,"What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar.
"
5,7,235,Barney:,"We love scotch. It is awesome.
"
5,7,236,Robin:,"That might be it. There may be too great there.
"
5,7,237,Barney:,"Exactly. Two awesome cancel out, and... I'm tired of being canceled.
"
5,7,238,Robin:,"Me too. We separate?
"
5,7,239,Barney:,"I think. sh1t. Following happens. After which you and I can not become friends again.
"
5,7,240,Robin:,"It's maybe not a break. This is perhaps... two friends... who find themselves.
"
5,7,241,Alan Thicke:,"It's always nice to see a compatriot.
"
5,7,242,Meg-the-crazy:,"Good news! I forgive you for that restraining order.
"
5,7,243,Robin:,"It's a stormtrooper?
"
5,7,244,Barney:,"It's not a stormtr... We're going from here?
"
5,7,245,Alan Thicke:,"See you later.
"
5,7,246,Robin:,"In addition, Alan.
"
5,7,247,Meg-the-insane:,"You still live at 73rd Street?
"
5,7,248,Alan:,"How do you know?
"
5,7,249,Barney:,"Friends that are found. I like it.
"
5,7,250,Robin:,"One for the Road?
"
5,7,251,Barney:,"And then who knows? Maybe in 40 years, if you have not found anyone...
"
5,7,252,Robin:,"I am already involved with Ted.
"
5,7,253,Barney:,"It's true. Thin. Maybe in 39 years, if you have not found anyone...
"
5,7,254,Ted (2030):,"It turned out that they had just let things happen.
"
5,7,255,Marshall:,"So, how is Barney?
"
5,7,256,Robin:,"Well, I think. It may take a while to recover, but... You had a thrill?
"
5,7,257,Barney:,"Dad returned.
"
5,7,258,Alan:,"Content that is either mentioned it again.
"
5,7,259,Robin:,"It is getting it soon.
"
5,7,260,Lily:,"I love that you are always so many friends after this clip.
"
5,7,261,Alan:,"Clip? The video for ""Sandcastles""! It was also this together.
"
5,7,262,Barney:,"What do you mean ""too""?
"
5,7,263,Alan:,"We had this issue of Canadian variety that missed. It was so shameful. Imagine what would happen if someone put their hands on it?
"
5,7,264,Robin:,"You then.
"
5,13,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, when you're 30 and live in New York, there are few places where it is better not to be. Time Square at New Year, Christmas at Rockefeller Center, but the worst: a student bar!
"
5,13,2,Ted:,"You're not serious, my students are going to catch me so I do them a lesson. I have not even my slide projector.
"
5,13,3,Marshall:,"Ted, I'm champion of skee-ball, since law school. I have come here at least once a month to keep my record.
"
5,13,4,Ted:,"Looks like you're not income from a lease, a guy called ""Big caramel"" you're passed.
"
5,13,5,Marshall:,"Yes, yes.
"
5,13,6,Ted:,"And you're ""Big caramel.""
"
5,13,7,Marshall:,"The biggest. In fact, I must tell you something. I invited Jenkins.
"
5,13,8,Ted (2030):,"We have heard of Jenkins few weeks ago.
"
5,13,9,Marshall:,"You will not believe what Jenkins has done this time.
"
5,13,10,Ted:,"Who is Jenkins?
"
5,13,11,Lily:,"This is a new lawyer in the office of Marshall, he is hilarious.
"
5,13,12,Marshall:,"Hilarious! There was a jar of cherries in the fridge, then Jenkins said: $ 200 and I eat the whole pot. So we gave him $ 200, and he ate the whole jar!
"
5,13,13,Ted (2030):,"And the stories continued.
"
5,13,14,Marshall:,"The CFO comes to sign papers, then Jenkins said: Excuse me Mr Wilkocs, I think we forgot one of the documents.We all went to a bar after work, Jenkins goes on the table and begins to gesticulate like a stripper, and a second later, he removes his shirt. It was so disgusting.
"
5,13,15,Ted:,"Well it feels good to finally meet the famous Jenkins, after all these stories.
"
5,13,16,"Barney, joining them:","And there's going to have another. I'll sleep with Jenkins.
"
5,13,17,Ted:,"What?!
"
5,13,18,Barney:,"You heard me.
"
5,13,19,Ted:,"You want to sleep with Jenkins?
"
5,13,20,Barney:,"With Jenkins, of Jenkins, near Jenkins. You said it, I want to put like a sock.
"
5,13,21,Ted:,"But you are... really... I did not know that...
"
5,13,22,Woman:,"Hi, guys.
"
5,13,23,Marshall:,"Ted Jenkins here.
"
5,13,24,Ted:,"It's going to seem crazy, but I thought Jenkins was a guy.
"
5,13,25,Marshall:,"What!? Where did you get it?
"
5,13,26,Ted:,"I do not know, maybe history: Jenkins pissed out the window of a taxi.
"
5,13,27,Marshall:,"Yes, even more impressive now, right?
"
5,13,28,Ted:,"Yes.
"
5,13,29,Marshall:,"Ok, I confess! It all started a few weeks.
"
5,13,30,Man:,"In fact the myopic! New lawyer, Jenkins here. Watch out for this guy, he steals things.
"
5,13,31,Marshall:,"I do not steal. And I do not wear glasses. Marshall.
"
5,13,32,Jenkins:,"Hi Marshall. So you're really a fan of the Vikings, or he lied about that too?
"
5,13,33,Marshall:,"Why? It's a trap, you're a fan of the Packers? My wife knows I'm here. She has no money, however it has very special skills.
"
5,13,34,Jenkins:,"I'm a fan of the Vikings too! I think purple and gold. I am from Pelican Rapids.
"
5,13,35,Marshall:,"Pelican Rapids? My grandfather lives there. Finally he's dead now, but it haunts a bar on a road.
"
5,13,36,Ted:,"Wait, if you tell me that you flirt with a woman other than yours, I'll pull out and hit you.
"
5,13,37,Marshall:,"First, you can not control the Grand caramel. Secondly, I see it as a big brother, who has breasts. My older brother had also, in short.
"
5,13,38,Marshall:,"That night, I spoke to Lily.
"
5,13,39,Lily:,"I'm in a hurry to meet him.
"
5,13,40,Marshall:,"I should correct, it would have been so simple.
"
5,13,41,Marshall:,"But I have not done. So now, whenever I talk about Jenkins, I avoid pronouns.
"
5,13,42,Marshall:,"So the manager comes to marketing staff to choose Midwest. So he, he, he, she, him, him, Jenkins, him, her.
"
5,13,43,Ted:,"Look, I understand why you have not told him? You really think she would be jealous too.
"
5,13,44,Marshall:,"Ted, think of the stories I've told.
"
5,13,45,Ted:,"Yes, it could be a problem.
"
5,13,46,Marshall:,"Exactly, that's why Lily can know nothing.
"
5,13,47,Robin:,"Lily can know nothing of what?
"
5,13,48,Ted:,"What Marshall is going to buy a horse.
"
5,13,49,Robin:,"Really?! It's great, I love this stuff. Guys why this kid staring at me? I understand, I think it happens at last. I recognized my show.
"
5,13,50,Ted:,"That's so cute. But it's Scotty, one of my students, and he looks at me me. Weird that I'm more famous than you.
"
5,13,51,Robin:,"No, I go on TV.
"
5,13,52,Ted:,"And I have 30 students in my class, which means, go, 30 times your hearing. We're going to buy Scotty a drink for old teacher. Scotty then, a question on neoclassical architecture, and it's good.
"
5,13,53,Scotty:,"You are Robin Scherbatsky, right?
"
5,13,54,Ted:,"What?
"
5,13,55,Robin:,"Yes.
"
5,13,56,Scotty:,"I did not want to fix, it's just that I watch your show all the time.
"
5,13,57,Robin:,"Really?
"
5,13,58,Ted:,"Really?
"
5,13,59,Scotty:,"Bluntly. Why do you hang out with Ted?
"
5,13,60,Ted:,"Uh, this is Professor Mosby.
"
5,13,61,Robin:,"We're friends.
"
5,13,62,Scotty:,"The cow! Robin Scherbatsky is friends with my art teacher.
"
5,13,63,Ted:,"This is architecture. Go will study.
"
5,13,64,Scotty:,"And a second, you're ""Big caramel""?
"
5,13,65,Ted:,"Go!
"
5,13,66,Marshall:,"Hello?
"
5,13,67,Lily:,"Hey baby, I go up there.
"
5,13,68,Marshall:,"What, why?
"
5,13,69,Lily:,"There was a problem at school, it was therefore the day. I thought to visit you, eat something with a nice little dessert.
"
5,13,70,Marshall:,"I have a problem, it was my wife. The first time I spoke to you, she thought you were a man, so...
"
5,13,71,Jenkins:,".. then you're afraid she became insane upon learning that I am a woman.
"
5,13,72,Marshall:,"Absolutely.
"
5,13,73,Jenkins:,"Good God, I was in a band improv. Am what I do.
"
5,13,74,Lily:,"Hello, I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.
"
5,13,75,Jenkins:,"Hi Lily, I am of the French Embassy. I am here because of a little problem with cheese but important.
"
5,13,76,Marshall:,"It is Jenkins.
"
5,13,77,Lily:,"You are Jenkins?
"
5,13,78,Jenkins:,"Yes, well, uh, I'll let you sort it out between you, see you later.
"
5,13,79,Ted (2030):,"Marshall cracked. The moment he feared.
"
5,13,80,Lily:,"The famous Jenkins, gosh. I imagined a man, in short, we eat?
"
5,13,81,Marshall:,"Wait, you're not jealous at all?
"
5,13,82,Lily:,"Honey, I do not have to worry about you and another woman.
"
5,13,83,Marshall:,"Because we love to madness, right?
"
5,13,84,Lily:,"Yes of course. Let's eat.
"
5,13,85,Marshall:,"It was not jealous at all.
"
5,13,86,Ted:,"Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.
"
5,13,87,Marshall:,"What is this supposed to mean?
"
5,13,88,Robin:,"That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high.
"
5,13,89,Ted:,"Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.
"
5,13,90,Marshall:,"I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak.
"
5,13,91,Robin:,"That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped.
"
5,13,92,Marshall:,"No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low.
"
5,13,93,Robin:,"Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse.
"
5,13,94,Marshall:,"What?
"
5,13,95,Robin:,"Try your luck.
"
5,13,96,Ted:,"So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V. (Robin enters the classroom Ted) Excuse me one second. What are you doing here?
"
5,13,97,Robin:,"I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee: thy pen.
"
5,13,98,Ted:,"It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently.
"
5,13,99,Robin:,"Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work.
"
5,13,100,Ted:,"No, it is not.
"
5,13,101,Robin:,"Come on, stand New York.
"
5,13,102,Student:,"I watch your show all the time.
"
5,13,103,Robin:,"Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here?
"
5,13,104,Ted:,"Thank you for last, Robin.
"
5,13,105,Robin:,"That night, great show on poisons. (She goes out, then reopens the door) Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9.
"
5,13,106,Ted:,"Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.
"
5,13,107,Scotty:,"The truth is that we look for the drinking game.
"
5,13,108,Ted:,"The what?
"
5,13,109,Student:,"As the show starts early, it is often at the bar. So when she did an interview, one should drink when she says ""But um"".
"
5,13,110,Barney:,"But huh?
"
5,13,111,Ted:,"But um, it would seem, she often said.
"
5,13,112,Barney:,"It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach...
"
5,13,113,Ted:,"It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.
"
5,13,114,Barney:,"Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said ""But um"" so often?
"
5,13,115,Ted (2030):,"Tonight, we saw how much she often said.
"
5,13,116,Robin:,"It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?
"
5,13,117,Boy:,"No, the third.
"
5,13,118,Robin:,"Oh that's good. But hmm. But um...
"
5,13,119,Marshall:,"Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong.
"
5,13,120,Lily:,"Let me see.
"
5,13,121,Marshall:,"It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think?
"
5,13,122,Lily:,"I think sometimes it's the case.
"
5,13,123,Marshall:,"But not for us?
"
5,13,124,Lily:,"No, of course not.
"
5,13,125,Marshall:,"Sure. Imagine, you have a gun to his head, you have to say that one of us is low.
"
5,13,126,Lily:,"I would say this is me, this is what is right.
"
5,13,127,Marshall:,"Now, the gun is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years.
"
5,13,128,Lily:,"No, no weak or strong.
"
5,13,129,Marshall:,"So this...
"
5,13,130,Ted (2030):,"It went on for a while, until finally...
"
5,13,131,Marshall:,"Our two children, our 8 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren our, our plane piloted by Oprah, and it is poised to spits at an art museum that contains all your favorite pictures, and the only way save everything, and answered: Art thou the weak or strong?
"
5,13,132,Lily:,"And Oprah has tried everything?
"
5,13,133,Marshall:,"Everything you need to decide now.
"
5,13,134,Lily:,"I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong.
"
5,13,135,Marshall:,"How can you say such a thing!
"
5,13,136,Marshall:,"She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.
"
5,13,137,Barney:,"Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2.
"
5,13,138,Ted:,"Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?
"
5,13,139,Marshall:,"Yes, an ordinary night for the ""Big caramel.""
"
5,13,140,Marshall:,"Do you think she was flirting with me?
"
5,13,141,Ted:,"Bluntly.
"
5,13,142,Marshall:,"Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the ""Big caramel""... may move, ok let me try again.
"
5,13,143,Ted:,"Okay, I understand.
"
5,13,144,Robin:,"Ted, I have a great idea.
"
5,13,145,Ted:,"Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat.
"
5,13,146,Robin:,"If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn.
"
5,13,147,Ted:,"Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater.
"
5,13,148,Robin:,"Look, just because your class prefers me to you...
"
5,13,149,Ted:,".. You're a drinking game.
"
5,13,150,Robin:,"What?
"
5,13,151,Ted:,"That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say ""But um"", they take a shot.
"
5,13,152,Robin:,"But umm?
"
5,13,153,Ted:,"Yes.
"
5,13,154,Robin:,"I'm not But um, I never told But hum.
"
5,13,155,Ted:,"So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Barney, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this.
"
5,13,156,Marshall:,"Hey Jenkins!
"
5,13,157,Jenkins:,"Hey buddy!
"
5,13,158,Marshall:,"So, Lily and I go back to university bar. And you wonder if maybe you would come... You could watch me play skee-ball... do exactly what you did the other night, something like that. It's really up to you, I mean...
"
5,13,159,Lily:,"Hey baby, what do you do at home?
"
5,13,160,Marshall:,"Baby! That is, it's a name I do not deserve.
"
5,13,161,Lily:,"What?
"
5,13,162,Lily:,"Oh, I see what happens. That's about all that history of strong and weak.
"
5,13,163,Marshall:,"You're sure it's not a fever?
"
5,13,164,Lily:,"You wanna make me jealous so you invent a story with Jenkins.
"
5,13,165,Marshall:,"I did not invent it! It happened, this woman kissed me.With language, his tongue was in my mouth.
"
5,13,166,Lily:,"Of course it was.
"
5,13,167,Marshall:,"It was silky... and hard as a branch of starfish
"
5,13,168,Lily:,"I'm so jealous, I'll go see it and hit right on the nose... like an old sandwich. Come on baby, you want some soup?
"
5,13,169,Marshall:,"It happened! Have you... meatballs?
"
5,13,170,Ted:,"And here's a few of his contributions to architecture and now... We remember him for just one thing. My friends this is the sad legacy of Gregorio... Franchetti Gazibo. Questions?
"
5,13,171,Scotty:,"You want to come to the bar with us tonight?
"
5,13,172,Ted:,"What?
"
5,13,173,Scotty:,"Yeah, we wanted to do some of Robin Scherbatsky, if you want to come?
"
5,13,174,Ted:,"Well, what can I say except... um But I am! I can always come? I will pay?
"
5,13,175,Robin:,"So, your third book is your new novel, but um...
"
5,13,176,"All, the student bar:","But hum!
"
5,13,177,Robin:,"sh1t! Sorry. But, but just. No hum! Your first book was written more quickly?
"
5,13,178,Man:,"Oh, it's true!
"
5,13,179,Robin:,"But umm...
"
5,13,180,All:,"But hum!
"
5,13,181,Ted:,"It's not pretty!
"
5,13,182,Ted (2030):,"And that's when that Robin had an idea that would end the game forever.
"
5,13,183,Robin:,"I wanted to ask about the novel you're writing right now, but um...
"
5,13,184,All:,"But hum!
"
5,13,185,Robin:,"And tonight, you had to, but um...
"
5,13,186,All:,"But hum!
"
5,13,187,Robin:,"For a long time, but um...
"
5,13,188,All:,"But hum!
"
5,13,189,Ted:,"No, no, no, do not drink, it's a trap!
"
5,13,190,Man:,"I think I should go, keep your $ 10!
"
5,13,191,Robin:,"Ok, um... but thank you for coming but um... If there are students who look, but um, but um, but um...
"
5,13,192,Scotty:,"We should drink professor, is the rule! She said but um.
"
5,13,193,Ted:,"My God, help us all!
"
5,13,194,Jenkins:,"Oh you're here! I'm really sorry to have embraced yesterday.
"
5,13,195,Marshall:,"It's nothing.
"
5,13,196,Jenkins:,"And I'm sorry I slept with you in the mail room.
"
5,13,197,Marshall:,"It was not me!
"
5,13,198,Jenkins:,"Oh my God, that's embarrassing 2 discussions today. I do not do usually, I was totally stuffed.
"
5,13,199,Marshall:,"You were drunk at 8am?
"
5,13,200,Jenkins:,"Yeah, I know not what has happened!
"
5,13,201,Robin:,"The police officer was unharmed but um...
"
5,13,202,Jenkins:,"But hum! (She drinks her glass bottoms up) I gotta work!
"
5,13,203,Marshall:,"Happy to have you helped you remember.
"
5,13,204,Jenkins:,"Damn, how I could do that!
"
5,13,205,Marshall:,"It's nothing!
"
5,13,206,Jenkins:,"No, you know what it is not nothing. You are the coolest guy in the office that stupid. And I really do not want to spoil our friendship. This is so embarrassing, do not tell anyone please.
"
5,13,207,Marshall:,"No, who am I to say? Lily? I said to Lily.
"
5,13,208,Jenkins:,"For heaven's sake, I have to go talk to him, I must apologize!
"
5,13,209,Marshall:,"No, no!
"
5,13,210,Jenkins:,"If Marshall, I must say that it happened, it meant nothing... And I'm sorry.
"
5,13,211,Marshall:,"No, I... Yes! Yes! Do it!
"
5,13,212,Jenkins:,"I'm going.
"
5,13,213,Marshall:,"And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can.
"
5,13,214,Jenkins:,"So Lily, what I'm saying is that... It happened and I feel terrible. And I am truly sorry.
"
5,13,215,Marshall:,"Well, it happened! What will we do? It happened!Terrible, like you said. It happened!
"
5,13,216,Jenkins:,"Exactly, I feel bad and I hate myself. If what I have done you got injured or affected your relationship with Marshall, forgive me!
"
5,13,217,Lily:,"Kissed my husband! MY HUSBAND! Nobody embraces the father of my future children besides me.
"
5,13,218,Barney:,"Marshall, you're in the field!
"
5,13,219,Ted (2030):,"Children, your Uncle Marshall was never tried again to make your aunt Lily jealous.
"
5,13,220,Marshall:,"Lil '? It's good!
"
5,13,221,Ted:,"So we'll just have a quiet day course. Nobody is talking! No noise!
"
5,13,222,Robin:,"How's you all?
"
5,13,223,Ted:,"No, no, no, please. Just goes away!
"
5,13,224,Robin:,"I just wanted to tell you go... (She takes a megaphone) To all those watching. Go! Standing New York! BUT HUM!
"
5,12,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, you never know when you will meet someone important. It's not as if life warned you. You look, and they are there.
"
5,12,2,Student:,"Come on, let's go get stoned on the roof.
"
5,12,3,Ted (2030):,"No, not this guy. It.
"
5,12,4,Student:,"Do not bother, Boomer.
"
5,12,5,Student:,"I do not call me Boomer.
"
5,12,6,Student:,"For me, this is your name.
"
5,12,7,Ted:,"Gentlemen, I am a professor at this university and you are minor, so it is my duty to confiscate it, and that, and... the cooler?You know what, Boomer? You can keep it.
"
5,12,8,Student:,"Each week, a guy in a fraternity invites me to a party and I said ""I am preparing my PhD and I write a thesis which is entitled Foreign Direct Investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. ""
"
5,12,9,Ted:,"And they will respond?
"
5,12,10,Student:,"""It's sexy. ""
"
5,12,11,Ted:,"Actually, it's really sexy.
"
5,12,12,Student:,"I have a confession to make. I recognize you. Do you remember the first day of last semester? Advanced Eco?
"
5,12,13,Ted (2030):,"Children, do you remember the history of bad amphitheater.
"
5,12,14,Ted (2030):,"I thought I was in architecture intro, I was in advanced eco. Of course, I did not know that your mother was in the auditorium, and she took me for an idiot.
"
5,12,15,Student:,"I took you for an idiot. But a very cute idiot.
"
5,12,16,Ted:,"You go out with idiots cute?
"
5,12,17,Student:,"Almost all the time.
"
5,12,18,Ted:,"She wants to do a doctorate, she reads the philosophy for fun, she finished the crossword in the Sunday New York Times.
"
5,12,19,Barney:,"Ted, I am happy for you. Sorry, not for you, not to be you.
"
5,12,20,Ted:,"To summarize, I have a date tonight. (We hear screaming outside) Thank you, New York! I try not to screw up.
"
5,12,21,Lily:,"What's going on? There are queuing outside the McLaren's.
"
5,12,22,Robin:,"Why it's almost that guys?
"
5,12,23,Barney:,"Only two things can cause this turmoil.
"
5,12,24,Barney:,"Ladies and gentlemen, the McLaren's hired a sexy barmaid.
"
5,12,25,Lily:,"Look at all these guys. The sidewalk will feel the pee now.
"
5,12,26,Robin:,"We'd better find a new bar.
"
5,12,27,Barney:,"What... are you crazy? It's a sexy barmaid. Do you know how long I've waited for me... My friends, I slept with many women in my glory days. Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge...
"
5,12,28,Robin:,"Abbreviates!
"
5,12,29,Barney:,"I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight.
"
5,12,30,Robin:,"It's not so sexy.
"
5,12,31,Ted:,"Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar?
"
5,12,32,Robin:,"No. Shut up!
"
5,12,33,Barney:,"Wish me luck.
"
5,12,34,Lily:,"It will never happen. She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses.
"
5,12,35,Barney:,"Guess who will not fall under his spell? I will make him ""Do not try, baby. Papa needs a gin and tonic. ""And when she will, I recracherai saying"" Do it again. "" The dominant male where it should be: on top, and after a few minutes below. Why should I do anything?
"
5,12,36,Marshall:,"Guys, what's up?
"
5,12,37,Lily:,"A new super sexy barmaid.
"
5,12,38,Robin:,"You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy.
"
5,12,39,Lily:,"If he thinks. Do not bother to pretend that other women are not attractive just for my own good.
"
5,12,40,Marshall:,"I know, and if this woman was almost as sexy as mine, so I admit, but it is not the case.
"
5,12,41,Lily:,"Baby, you're an angel, but compared to this woman, I am a big trash bag 3 days.
"
5,12,42,Marshall:,"I say what I see, and... I think until you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
"
5,12,43,Lily:,"You see, it's really annoying.
"
5,12,44,Barmaid:,"You're so funny. It'll be $ 6.75.
"
5,12,45,Man:,"There's, 50, keep the change.
"
5,12,46,Barmaid:,"Thank you.
"
5,12,47,Barney:,"Amateurs.
"
5,12,48,Barmaid:,"What do you want?
"
5,12,49,Barney:,"Do not even try, baby. Wait, what?
"
5,12,50,Barmaid:,"You're going to stay there in order to be ridiculous?
"
5,12,51,Barney:,"Uh...
"
5,12,52,Barmaid:,"I do not know a Heu. It's half vodka and half-bar of yourself then?
"
5,12,53,Ted (2030):,"That night I went to a very important first date.
"
5,12,54,Ted:,"How are you?
"
5,12,55,Student:,"Okay. Between.
"
5,12,56,Ted (2030):,"It's funny, sometimes you walk into an apartment for the first time, but it was the feeling of being right where it should be. And children, it was the first time I saw the little yellow bus of your mother. You know him. It is right behind you.
"
5,12,57,Ted:,"It's cute.
"
5,12,58,Student:,"Actually, this is my roommate.
"
5,12,59,Ted (2030):,"And so I was there in the apartment of your mother, except that I was dating her roommate, Cindy.
"
5,12,60,Ted:,"Sorry, I should not play with the affairs of your roommate.She look like?
"
5,12,61,Ted (2030):,"I do not know, but I would hear the first description of the woman I would marry.
"
5,12,62,Cindy:,"That is a whore. I think this is a dominatrix.
"
5,12,63,Ted:,"What?
"
5,12,64,Cindy:,"Okay, sorry, this is not true. I have a roommate complex.
"
5,12,65,Ted:,"Why?
"
5,12,66,Cindy:,"The guys always fall in love with her.
"
5,12,67,Ted:,"Look at me. I promise, I would not fall in love with your roommate.
"
5,12,68,Ted (2030):,"Oops!
"
5,12,69,Lily:,"Now that you have been looking more closely, admit it: the bartender is the sexiest of the Bar.
"
5,12,70,Robin:,"The second sexiest.
"
5,12,71,Marshall:,"I repeat...
"
5,12,72,Lily:,"Baby, how can you not want you to do? I want to do it. If you do not wanna do it, sorry, but you must be gay.
"
5,12,73,Marshall:,"Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.
"
5,12,74,Barney:,"No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?
"
5,12,75,Marshall:,"Yes... You will not like the answer.
"
5,12,76,Barmaid:,"My last three were former Wall Street brokers.Bastards. I swore never to go out with a guy who wears suits.
"
5,12,77,Barney:,"It's easy. I just have to stop wearing costumes.
"
5,12,78,Robin:,"Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume.
"
5,12,79,Barney:,"True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait...
"
5,12,80,Robin:,"We know you're gonna say ""costumes"".
"
5,12,81,Ted (2030):,"Meanwhile, Cindy and I spent a pleasant evening, but she was not kidding about his roommate complex.
"
5,12,82,Cindy:,"Another weird thing on my roommate: she paints robots who play sports.
"
5,12,83,Ted:,"It's strange.
"
5,12,84,Ted (2030):,"I lied. It looked great. The watercolor of the robot playing volleyball with your mother is still in remission.
"
5,12,85,Cindy:,"And she has this weird habit of blackmailing his breakf.
"
5,12,86,Ted:,"It's weird.
"
5,12,87,Ted (2030):,"The version of ""Memories"" of your mother, sung by an English muffin, is to date the most beautiful thing I've heard in my life.
"
5,12,88,Ted:,"Look, I am defeated. I hate it.
"
5,12,89,Cindy:,"Sorry. It is not so bad. I'm just a little jealous.
"
5,12,90,Ted:,"I do not know why. You're great.
"
5,12,91,Ted (2030):,"But not as much as your mother. And speaking of things that are less brilliant, your uncle Barney was formally arrested costumes.
"
5,12,92,Barmaid:,"Sorry to have misjudged you. If there is a kind of men I can not stand are those in costume. Ca, and a woman who does not comply.
"
5,12,93,Barney:,"The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them.
"
5,12,94,Robin:,"So, your date with Cindy?
"
5,12,95,Ted:,"Well, last night, it was nice today, less.
"
5,12,96,Lily:,"Why?
"
5,12,97,Cindy:,"I discovered that the settlement on all outgoing students and teachers are very strict. I could lose my scholarship.
"
5,12,98,Ted:,"It's not like if you followed my progress. It is not even in the same department.
"
5,12,99,Cindy:,"Sorry, but I can not take that risk.
"
5,12,100,Ted:,"She exaggerates, there, right?
"
5,12,101,Robin:,"Well, Ted, she's right.
"
5,12,102,Lily:,"And thoughtful. If the rules are so strict, you could put your work in.
"
5,12,103,Marshall:,"I think you should leave it, buddy.
"
5,12,104,Ted:,"Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right?
"
5,12,105,Ted (2030):,"Of course they were right. I had to let her go, but as your uncle Barney was discovered, it is not always easy.
"
5,12,106,Barney conscience:,"In costume.
"
5,12,107,Ted (2030):,"None of us had seen for so long without Barney costume, and children, it was not pretty.
"
5,12,108,Marshall:,"Sorry for my delay. I was stuck at work. I had this presentation on taxes on dividends.
"
5,12,109,Lily:,"Of course, I listened carefully when you spoke.
"
5,12,110,Marshall:,"So, I started the Powerpoint... (rubs Barney costume at Marshall) Barney?
"
5,12,111,Barney conscience:,"In costume.
"
5,12,112,Marshall:,"We will order food.
"
5,12,113,Barney:,"I arrive in a second.
"
5,12,114,"Barney, running down the street:","Out of my way! Stay with me.It's not your time.
"
5,12,115,Ted (2030):,"If someone could fix such a thing, it was the tailor personnel Barney, TV's Tim Gunn.
"
5,12,116,Tim:,"Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do.
"
5,12,117,Barney:,"So young. You can not do anything else?
"
5,12,118,Tim:,"No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another.
"
5,12,119,Barney:,"It can... As an organ donor?
"
5,12,120,Tim:,"The death of this suit could save the life of another.
"
5,12,121,Barney:,"But I... Do it.
"
5,12,122,Tim:,"You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.
"
5,12,123,Barney:,"Sorry. I know. I know.
"
5,12,124,Barney:,"We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.
"
5,12,125,Robin:,"Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.
"
5,12,126,Barney:,"No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine.
"
5,12,127,Ted:,"There is absolutely right.
"
5,12,128,Lily:,"Who, the guy who kisses an urn full of ashes costume. This guy?
"
5,12,129,Ted:,"What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either! (Ted gets up and kissed the urn of Barney before leaving) I do not know why I did that.
"
5,12,130,Barmaid:,"Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him.
"
5,12,131,Barney:,"It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no.
"
5,12,132,Barmaid:,"How old was he?
"
5,12,133,Barney:,"7 years. I miss him so much!
"
5,12,134,Barmaid:,"You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.
"
5,12,135,Barney:,"Thank you, old friend. You go on a good shot.
"
5,12,136,Lily:,"Admit it, she is sexier than me. It will not hurt me.
"
5,12,137,Marshall:,"I can not. You're sexier than she.
"
5,12,138,Lily:,"That's a goddess! Her skin glows. Her legs are super long.And that ass? I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once.
"
5,12,139,Marshall:,"What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me?
"
5,12,140,Lily:,"I never said that.
"
5,12,141,Marshall:,"You think so!
"
5,12,142,Lily:,"It's not comparable. She is younger than you.
"
5,12,143,Marshall:,"I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old.
"
5,12,144,Robin:,"You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look.
"
5,12,145,Marshall:,"I guess you also think she is sexier than me.
"
5,12,146,Carl:,"What are you doing?
"
5,12,147,Robin:,"What?
"
5,12,148,Carl:,"You do not have the right to be there.
"
5,12,149,Robin:,"Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave.
"
5,12,150,Carl:,"You have to go. You have to go.
"
5,12,151,Robin:,"I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me.
"
5,12,152,Ted:,"Can we talk?
"
5,12,153,Cindy:,"My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room.
"
5,12,154,Ted:,"I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says ""Do not teach in having drunk"" and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you.
"
5,12,155,Cindy:,"I do not want it, me either.
"
5,12,156,Ted:,"I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common.
"
5,12,157,Cindy:,"Really?
"
5,12,158,Ted:,"The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.
"
5,12,159,Cindy:,"This is my roommate. I borrowed.
"
5,12,160,Ted:,"And that? After World T.C Boyle?
"
5,12,161,Cindy:,"Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet.
"
5,12,162,Ted:,"You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate.
"
5,12,163,Cindy:,"It is in a group.
"
5,12,164,Ted:,"Damn, that's cool.
"
5,12,165,Cindy:,"It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate.
"
5,12,166,Ted:,"The group played shows your roommate or...?
"
5,12,167,Cindy:,"Get out.
"
5,12,168,Ted (2030):,"Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella.
"
5,12,169,Barney:,"It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting.
"
5,12,170,Barmaid:,"I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.
"
5,12,171,Barney:,"Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is...
"
5,12,172,Barmaid:,"They are yours?
"
5,12,173,Barney:,"I'm the suit-sitting for someone.
"
5,12,174,Barmaid:,"Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes.
"
5,12,175,"Barney, singing and dancing in the street:","I know what you're thinking, ""What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! ""I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black! (2 men get out of a store with a rack filled with costumes) spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis.
"
5,12,176,"Marshall, doing the same:","Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?
"
5,12,177,Barney:,"Costumes!
"
5,12,178,Marshall:,"What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?
"
5,12,179,Barney:,"Costumes!
"
5,12,180,Robin:,"What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?
"
5,12,181,Barney:,"Do we see.
"
5,12,182,Lily:,"And a world at peace would be within your reach?
"
5,12,183,Barney:,"I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dépote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume...
"
5,12,184,"Ted, Marshall, Lily:","Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!
"
5,12,185,Barney:,"Mind you, it is rather barrel. (Back at Barney) I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes.
"
5,12,186,Barmaid:,"Really?
"
5,12,187,Barney:,"Yeah. (They kiss) I will do you nothing!
"
5,6,1,Ted (2030):,"In autumn 2009, a new couple moved just above.We had not met but you could hear all the time. They kept... children, say they did not stop ""playing the bagpipes.""
"
5,6,2,Robin:,"This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes.
"
5,6,3,Ted:,"I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.
"
5,6,4,Robin:,"It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park.
"
5,6,5,Ted:,"Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes!
"
5,6,6,Ted (2030):,"I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.
"
5,6,7,Barney:,"I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.
"
5,6,8,Ted:,"Not at all.
"
5,6,9,Barney:,"Look what I saw yesterday.
"
5,6,10,Lily:,"Baby, you can wash it?
"
5,6,11,Marshall:,"No problem.
"
5,6,12,Barney:,"I gotta go.
"
5,6,13,Barney:,"She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.
"
5,6,14,Ted:,"There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.
"
5,6,15,Barney:,"They have a big problem.
"
5,6,16,Ted:,"I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.
"
5,6,17,Barney:,"If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half.
"
5,6,18,Ted:,"And a half?
"
5,6,19,Barney:,"An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop.
"
5,6,20,Marshall:,"What's new?
"
5,6,21,Barney:,"Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.
"
5,6,22,Ted:,"According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.
"
5,6,23,Marshall:,"Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?
"
5,6,24,Barney:,"I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.
"
5,6,25,Marshall:,"Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.
"
5,6,26,Barney:,"Let me ask you a question.
"
5,6,27,Marshall:,"Go ahead.
"
5,6,28,Barney:,"Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?
"
5,6,29,Marshall:,"Not really.
"
5,6,30,Barney:,"So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.
"
5,6,31,Marshall:,"But if I said that, we will play, so...
"
5,6,32,Barney:,"You argue. Robin, we do not fight.
"
5,6,33,Ted:,"Of course I do.
"
5,6,34,Barney:,"No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...
"
5,6,35,Robin:,"Why is there a bag of pants marked ""April 2008"" in your closet?
"
5,6,36,Ted:,"So when you think you will play and you get up you go?
"
5,6,37,Barney:,"It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.
"
5,6,38,Ted:,"This is not true.
"
5,6,39,Marshall:,"I can not believe Robin supports it.
"
5,6,40,Barney:,"Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.
"
5,6,41,Robin:,"The ties go to the machine?
"
5,6,42,Marshall:,"You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.
"
5,6,43,Ted:,"Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird.
"
5,6,44,Marshall:,"Call me crazy.
"
5,6,45,Ted:,"Mad.
"
5,6,46,Marshall:,"But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.
"
5,6,47,Barney:,"There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.
"
5,6,48,Lily:,"Barney, you came home!
"
5,6,49,Marshall:,"Go to the basics!
"
5,6,50,Barney:,"Okay.
"
5,6,51,Barney:,"Thank you, doll.
"
5,6,52,Lily:,"Honey, you're going to wash it?
"
5,6,53,Barney:,"I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?
"
5,6,54,Lily:,"No. Of course not.
"
5,6,55,Barney:,"Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.
"
5,6,56,Lily:,"Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.
"
5,6,57,Barney:,"It's because you're a woman.
"
5,6,58,Lily:,"I do not even know why we laugh!
"
5,6,59,Barney:,"Of course not.
"
5,6,60,Ted:,"Are you kidding me.
"
5,6,61,Marshall:,"Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.
"
5,6,62,Barney:,"Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.
"
5,6,63,Barney:,"Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.
"
5,6,64,Lily:,"You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.
"
5,6,65,Barney:,"Now, turn around.
"
5,6,66,Ted:,"You beat him or I do it?
"
5,6,67,Marshall:,"He's right.
"
5,6,68,Ted:,"No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.
"
5,6,69,Barney:,"The piercing was cool.
"
5,6,70,Marshall:,"It was cool, huh?
"
5,6,71,Ted:,"Stay with me! Barney is wrong.
"
5,6,72,Marshall:,"No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away.
"
5,6,73,Ted:,"You just said the opposite!
"
5,6,74,Marshall:,"I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!
"
5,6,75,Barney:,"You're welcome.
"
5,6,76,Ted:,"Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.
"
5,6,77,Robin:,"I think that's true.
"
5,6,78,Barney:,"I told you.
"
5,6,79,Ted:,"Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.
"
5,6,80,Robin:,"You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy.
"
5,6,81,Ted:,"Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them.
"
5,6,82,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
5,6,83,Barney:,"Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!
"
5,6,84,Ted:,"Have fun.
"
5,6,85,Marshall:,"Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work.
"
5,6,86,Ted:,"I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.
"
5,6,87,Marshall:,"Will it work.
"
5,6,88,Ted:,"A second time. This is a bad idea.
"
5,6,89,Marshall:,"Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion.
"
5,6,90,Ted:,"No. She will be angry and you will play.
"
5,6,91,Marshall:,"It is a slap bet?
"
5,6,92,Ted:,"We bet a slap.
"
5,6,93,Lily:,"Baby, you can do the dishes?
"
5,6,94,Marshall:,"Lily, I am delighted that you mention.
"
5,6,95,Marshall:,"I can stay here tonight?
"
5,6,96,Ted:,"I am preparing the couch, man.
"
5,6,97,Robin:,"The ski babes are back!
"
5,6,98,Ted:,"How was the trip?
"
5,6,99,Barney:,"Okay.
"
5,6,100,Robin:,"We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags.
"
5,6,101,Ted:,"What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?
"
5,6,102,Barney:,"It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?
"
5,6,103,Ted:,"We all came out a year.
"
5,6,104,Barney:,"short, and your weekend?
"
5,6,105,Marshall:,"Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!
"
5,6,106,Lily:,"Baby, you can do the dishes?
"
5,6,107,Marshall:,"Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, ""Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies. "" You see? It's just...
"
5,6,108,Marshall:,"I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?
"
5,6,109,Barney:,"What happened to the ""I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love""?
"
5,6,110,Marshall:,"I should have noted.
"
5,6,111,Marshall:,"I'm making more money than you.
"
5,6,112,Lily:,"Excuse me?
"
5,6,113,Marshall:,"Dance for me.
"
5,6,114,Marshall:,"It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply.
"
5,6,115,Marshall:,"It started with the dishes but after...
"
5,6,116,Lily:,"So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me.
"
5,6,117,Marshall:,"It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest.
"
5,6,118,Lily:,"I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.
"
5,6,119,Marshall:,"You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow.
"
5,6,120,Lily:,"If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit.
"
5,6,121,Marshall:,"My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night.
"
5,6,122,Lily:,"Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance.
"
5,6,123,Marshall:,"Do not do that, please.
"
5,6,124,Marshall:,"Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.
"
5,6,125,Barney:,"You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.
"
5,6,126,Marshall:,"He's right.
"
5,6,127,Ted:,"Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.
"
5,6,128,Marshall:,"This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...
"
5,6,129,Barney:,"What do you eat?
"
5,6,130,Marshall:,"Well sh1t, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!
"
5,6,131,Robin:,"Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.
"
5,6,132,Barney:,"Hey, Ro-Ro.
"
5,6,133,Ted:,"You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?
"
5,6,134,Robin:,"Nothing. We're just happy.
"
5,6,135,Barney:,"As Gandhi said, ""A smile costs nothing, baby.""
"
5,6,136,Ted:,"I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.
"
5,6,137,Robin:,"So you talked to the neighbors?
"
5,6,138,Ted:,"Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back.
"
5,6,139,Robin:,"Some old?
"
5,6,140,Ted:,"Really old.
"
5,6,141,Robin:,"So you did what?
"
5,6,142,Ted:,"I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some racist comments and I left.
"
5,6,143,Ted (2030):,"The days of Barney and Robin continued to be happier than ever. (At the bar, Barney and Robin dance) and Marshall and Lily have continued to argue.
"
5,6,144,Marshall:,"I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it.
"
5,6,145,Lily:,"Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself.
"
5,6,146,Marshall:,"I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.
"
5,6,147,Lily:,"You will perhaps have to do it again.
"
5,6,148,Ted (2030):,"And I heard more than a bagpipe parade of St. Patrick.
"
5,6,149,Marshall:,"I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon.
"
5,6,150,Ted:,"It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.
"
5,6,151,Marshall:,"Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned.
"
5,6,152,Ted:,"You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames.
"
5,6,153,Ted:,"Thank you, Robbie Engineering.
"
5,6,154,Robin:,"I do not like nicknames.
"
5,6,155,Ted:,"You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?
"
5,6,156,Robin:,"Seriously, stop.
"
5,6,157,Ted:,"It's T-Mose.
"
5,6,158,Robin:,"I do not like with you either.
"
5,6,159,Marshall:,"Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose.
"
5,6,160,Ted:,"T-Mose was great. I think of the show.
"
5,6,161,Marshall:,"The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.
"
5,6,162,Ted:,"They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.
"
5,6,163,Ted (2030):,"And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.
"
5,6,164,Barney:,"How will Marshall and Lily?
"
5,6,165,Robin:,"Those two worry me, really.
"
5,6,166,Barney:,"You and your big, huge heart.
"
5,6,167,Ted:,"Enough. The game is over.
"
5,6,168,Barney:,"What do you mean by that?
"
5,6,169,Robin:,"Who, him?
"
5,6,170,Ted:,"It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too ""surnomants"". It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.
"
5,6,171,Robin:,"How would you know that?
"
5,6,172,Ted:,"Phil told me.
"
5,6,173,Barney:,"Who the hell is Phil?
"
5,6,174,Ted:,"Your downstairs neighbor.
"
5,6,175,Man:,"I'm Phil. 12-B.
"
5,6,176,Ted:,"And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?
"
5,6,177,Barney:,"All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.
"
5,6,178,Barney:,"I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.
"
5,6,179,Robin:,"It's your board that is zero.
"
5,6,180,Barney:,"You're on the side of Lily? You... (The chairlift stops) No. We will argue and I can not spin.
"
5,6,181,Robin:,"I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.
"
5,6,182,Barney:,"Or so I tried the jump?
"
5,6,183,Robin:,"Or just the pants?
"
5,6,184,Barney:,"This trick of dodging is over?
"
5,6,185,Robin:,"I think.
"
5,6,186,Barney:,"You have the? This is the smallest!
"
5,6,187,Robin:,"They fight because of you!?
"
5,6,188,Barney:,"And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.
"
5,6,189,Robin:,"All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.
"
5,6,190,Barney:,"The tie murdered by Robin.
"
5,6,191,Robin:,"The hidden camera in the headboard.
"
5,6,192,Barney:,"As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.
"
5,6,193,Robin:,"Barney for the millionth time...
"
5,6,194,Ted:,"I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!
"
5,6,195,Barney:,"Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.
"
5,6,196,Robin:,"It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.
"
5,6,197,Ted:,"I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.
"
5,6,198,Robin:,"Stop it.
"
5,6,199,Lily:,"Marshall, dinner is ready.
"
5,6,200,Marshall:,"You've done for me?
"
5,6,201,Lily:,"No, but what is your favorite.
"
5,6,202,Barney:,"We need advice.
"
5,6,203,Ted (2030):,"Robin and Barney told Lily and Marshall to their disputes. And let's just say, in comparison, their quarrels dishes seemed bland.
"
5,6,204,Ted (2030):,"And in the end, Lily and Marshall had the same reaction.
"
5,6,205,Marshall:,"I'll do the dishes directly to my death.
"
5,6,206,Lily:,"I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak.
"
5,6,207,Marshall:,"Sure, honey.
"
5,6,208,Lily:,"I love you.
"
5,6,209,Marshall:,"I love you too.
"
5,6,210,Robin:,"You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?
"
5,6,211,Marshall:,"I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside.
"
5,6,212,Lily:,"And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.
"
5,6,213,Barney:,"More important than winning.
"
5,6,214,Robin:,"Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?
"
5,6,215,Lily:,"The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part.
"
5,6,216,Robin:,"Good night.
"
5,6,217,Barney:,"What about now?
"
5,6,218,Robin:,"I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.
"
5,6,219,Barney:,"Or, there is a bench in the elevator.
"
5,6,220,Robin:,"That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?
"
5,6,221,Barney:,"Grave. It's not a competition.
"
5,6,222,Lily:,"We won!
"
5,6,223,Marshall:,"Best couple of the world!
"
5,6,224,Marshall:,"Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink.
"
5,6,225,Lily:,"You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink.
"
5,6,226,Ted (2030):,"And once the first fight set, all the others, well, they are also regulated.
"
5,10,1,Marshall:,"Well, I received another.
"
5,10,2,Robin:,"What's there in the box? What there was in the boiiite?What there was in the boiiiiiite?! What there was in the boiiiiiiite?! Not bad eh? Nothing. I'm the idiot huh? What there was in the box?
"
5,10,3,Ted:,"Since Lily and Marshall have their apartment, her mother keeps sending him old things she wants to get rid.
"
5,10,4,Marshall:,"Well done 'man, right on target this time. I really needed the right arm of Himan, and this old book of Mad Libs.Pet went to fart to fart loud. This is good. Thank you 'man.
"
5,10,5,Ted:,"Hello?
"
5,10,6,Older woman:,"Ted Mosby?
"
5,10,7,Ted:,"Yes.
"
5,10,8,Elderly Woman:,"The window is open.
"
5,10,9,Ted:,"What?
"
5,10,10,Elderly Woman:,"The window is open.
"
5,10,11,Ted:,"The window is open.
"
5,10,12,Marshall:,"What are you waiting for? Ted, run!
"
5,10,13,Ted:,"Lily, the window is open. Fight your way, watercourse Ted, run!
"
5,10,14,Woman:,"Ted?
"
5,10,15,Ted:,"Hey, Maggie. I was just, you know, hmm... How are you?
"
5,10,16,Maggie:,"I think I'm fine. Actually no, I'm not well. I just broke up with my boyfriend.
"
5,10,17,Ted:,"Oh, sorry for you. Wanna go out tonight?
"
5,10,18,Maggie:,"Yes, of course.
"
5,10,19,Marshall:,"Come on, tell me that happened to you on time?
"
5,10,20,Ted:,"I arrived!
"
5,10,21,Robin:,"What's happening? What is this window?
"
5,10,22,Ted:,"You see how everyone knows a person, and whatever happens, this person is perfect for you.
"
5,10,23,Robin:,"My cats.
"
5,10,24,Marshall:,"Lily.
"
5,10,25,Barney:,"That girl over there.
"
5,10,26,Ted:,"Well this girl was and still is Maggie Wilks.
"
5,10,27,Marshall:,"We went to college together, she's great. Everybody liked him.
"
5,10,28,Barney:,"Oh I know what we do here. Tell me when it stops.
"
5,10,29,Ted:,"It was not the fact that Maggie was good. It was the...
"
5,10,30,Marshall:,"It was the perfect girl next door.
"
5,10,31,Ted:,"It was the perfect girl next door. And still is. All the guys who meet Maggie fall madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I know her, she has been single for only three short windows of time.
"
5,10,32,Ted:,"When she moved here and broke up with her boyfriend in college, I waited one month, not to go for the spare wheel. And the spare wheel well, he stayed two years. After their breakup, I have waited a week. Late again. She stayed with guys for 3 years.
"
5,10,33,Ted:,"The third time, I was super fast. I got not even one hour after their breakup. The only thing she has made between the break and I arrived, it's down to her mail.
"
5,10,34,Ted:,"Late again. And she went out with him four years. I would not let me have it again. So I begged her neighbor, Ms. Doglas, call me when she and David have broken loose.
"
5,10,35,Ted:,"And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far.
"
5,10,36,Barney:,"Even when I arrived here, she still will not touch with a man. I feel good tonight, this evening will be well.
"
5,10,37,Marshall:,"This is my overalls. I wore this little baby, during high school.
"
5,10,38,Robin:,"Hey, you were really a virgin before he met Lily.
"
5,10,39,Marshall:,"It was not necessary.
"
5,10,40,Lily:,"She's right baby, if you had worn it in college, even I would not have slept with you. And if you remember, I wanted to.
"
5,10,41,Barney:,"No way, no one could sleep while wearing it. Challenge accepted. I, Barney Stinson, brilliant mind in an extraordinary body, this will overalls, and lie with a woman.
"
5,10,42,Robin:,"I went out with this guy.
"
5,10,43,Ted:,"Ok, game plan Maggie arrives, a few minutes of gathering and presentation, and everyone leaves us. This is my only chance, and I will not go wrong.
"
5,10,44,Robin:,"You do not give a lecture tonight?
"
5,10,45,Ted:,"Damn!
"
5,10,46,Lily:,"Oh my God, good evening.
"
5,10,47,Ted:,"I want you to Maggie Robin, my roommate.
"
5,10,48,Maggie:,"Nice to meet you.
"
5,10,49,Robin:,"Likewise.
"
5,10,50,Ted:,"I completely forgot, I teach a class tonight. How would you like to come and see what happens during an architecture?
"
5,10,51,Maggie:,"Ooh, not even a little. I'll stick with Marshall and Lily, that's fine.
"
5,10,52,Ted:,"Super. Sit down, put yourself at ease. Relaxed, everything is relaxed. Listen, you want me to find the perfect girl for you so all together, it's her. Do not let a guy to approach her. No server to take our order, clean the table, and if it ignites, I want a female firefighter to extinguish.
"
5,10,53,Marshall:,"I think that emergencies are taking applications like that.
"
5,10,54,Ted:,"Marshall Good God, do what you need to keep single until my return. I pay the bill, but do not abuse.
"
5,10,55,Marshall:,"Target secure?
"
5,10,56,Lily:,"Target secure.
"
5,10,57,Marshall:,"Wow, weird, pulled out all the toilets at the same time.
"
5,10,58,Lily:,"Let's go to the table all together.
"
5,10,59,Marshall:,"Look at that, our table.
"
5,10,60,"Lily, a man:","Get out!
"
5,10,61,Robin:,"Your challenge not interest me but you're cheating. Wear a suit under the overalls.
"
5,10,62,Barney:,"No. They are called not on the shirt, or on t-shirts for wholesale repairing the car and my mother spent some time with her top. They are called overalls, and I can relate to what I want.
"
5,10,63,Robin:,"Oh it does not tell you goodnight, he tells you how he feeds his horses. I could sit there and tell jokes Farmer on you all night. Challenge accepted.
"
5,10,64,Ted:,"Good evening, tonight we will quickly see the different bridges. There are 6 types of bridges, small, large, with suspension and three others. You land on each side and water in the middle. See you next week.
"
5,10,65,Student:,"It was a course of 1 hour.
"
5,10,66,Ted:,"Who wants to hear me talk about bridges for 1 hour? (All raise their hands) Really?
"
5,10,67,Lily:,"I just remembered how Ted is awesome.
"
5,10,68,Maggie:,"Bizarre as drinking game.
"
5,10,69,Barney:,"I offer you a drink?
"
5,10,70,Robin:,"It was a big tractor 3-axis.
"
5,10,71,Barney:,"What do I do?
"
5,10,72,Ted:,"One important thing to remember when designing a bridge.
"
5,10,73,Student:,"Maggie?
"
5,10,74,Ted:,"No. Finally yes. When you design a bridge remember: ""Make Adjustments... Fetch energetically"" (""Make Ajustments Energize Go Get It"" Maggie acronym in English) Good advice in general too.
"
5,10,75,Student:,"Professor Mosby, Maggie is someone special?
"
5,10,76,Ted:,"No, I mean it's just that girl that interests me very long time.And tonight this is my chance to get away with it.
"
5,10,77,Student 2:,"It's Good?
"
5,10,78,Ted:,"Yes Jamie, she is very pretty. We can now finish the course. Betty?
"
5,10,79,Betty:,"Maggie is finally free, but you Professor, are you ready for a serious relationship?
"
5,10,80,Ted:,"Bluntly. I think. Perhaps. I dunno, you think what?
"
5,10,81,Marshall:,"Oh my God, I had totally forgotten that.
"
5,10,82,Maggie:,"What is it?
"
5,10,83,Marshall:,"A duty that day of my 15 years. Write a letter to your future you with a list of things you hope to do. ""Dear Future Me...""
"
5,10,84,Marshall:,"""... you better drive a camaro or a super van. This is priority numero uno. And your ponytail should happen to you at the knees. You can always dunk course and change your name to ""Vanilla Thunder"". Your wife, girlfriend, 1m80, a great body and take care of yourself. ""
"
5,10,85,Marshall:,"Sorry darling.
"
5,10,86,Lily:,"No problem, you just described your mother.
"
5,10,87,Maggie:,"Continuous.
"
5,10,88,Marshall:,"""You still wear overalls faded because it looks torn.And more importantly, you better save the world, and if you became a poor guy then throw yourself off a cliff, because you suck. And I ""Licky boom boom down"".
"
5,10,89,Marshall:,"Yes that's right, it's hilarious, I became a business poor guy. I work for GNB, the bank most unhealthy existence.
"
5,10,90,Maggie:,"Oh come on Thunder vanilla, everyone should grow up and get a job.
"
5,10,91,Lily:,"I remember in college, Maggie wanted to be a marine biologist by day and tutor children in difficulty at night. What you ended up doing?
"
5,10,92,Maggie:,"These things.
"
5,10,93,Lily:,"Baby, where you going?
"
5,10,94,Marshall:,"I have to do something at work, it will not be long.
"
5,10,95,Maggie:,"What did he?
"
5,10,96,Lily:,"Oh no, I think he'll resign. Sorry Maggie, I have to go stop him. (Lily comes out in pursuit of Marshall, leaving Maggie alone. A man turns to Maggie) Ted I had to leave the bar but it's good she is with Robin.
"
5,10,97,Ted:,"You're left with Maggie Robin?
"
5,10,98,Robin:,"Relax, everything is under control.
"
5,10,99,Ted:,"You do not understand, this girl is like a magnet to men... overkill.
"
5,10,100,Robin:,"I know a little something about loving to men... you see me as one of those magnets that can not put a picture of your children on the fridge. But I am one of these magnets... that can pick up cars in scrap yards...! (Robin returns to the table where she finds a man with Maggie) Who is it?
"
5,10,101,Maggie:,"Robin, this is a good friend of Jim's work.
"
5,10,102,Robin:,"Oh, well... hello you!
"
5,10,103,Ted:,"What does mean to be ready? I thought I was ready last year and I was left on the altar. I'll be honest. I'm scared! Ok, Luis and Betty!
"
5,10,104,Luis:,"We're all scared, Professor Mosby.
"
5,10,105,Betty:,"Do not be afraid you did not know that it's something important?
"
5,10,106,Ted:,"I mean, if you're not afraid you do not try your luck... and if you do not try your luck then... What are you doing? Not?
"
5,10,107,Jamie:,"I think you're ready buddy.
"
5,10,108,Maggie:,"You're too funny!
"
5,10,109,Robin:,"Funny? I think it's hilarious. In fact, I liked so much that I think I'm pissed.
"
5,10,110,Jim:,"I'd better go. I go to the first of this photo exhibition we talked about at work. I have a ticket if you want more?
"
5,10,111,Robin:,"I'd love to!
"
5,10,112,Ted:,"Ok, I gotta go!
"
5,10,113,Jamie:,"Just one last tip: M.A...
"
5,10,114,All:,".. G.G.I.E!
"
5,10,115,Ted:,"Hello?
"
5,10,116,Robin:,"Ted, change of plans!
"
5,10,117,Ted:,"You let him with Barney?
"
5,10,118,Barney:,"Ted, will you calm down? I'm your pal!
"
5,10,119,Ted:,"You're an animal!
"
5,10,120,Barney:,"And I know our relationship has suffered in this area, I assure you I'll be the perfect gentleman.
"
5,10,121,Maggie:,"Thank you! In fact, I love this bib!
"
5,10,122,Barney:,"You have 10 minutes to get here, the window closes.
"
5,10,123,Ted:,"10 minutes?
"
5,10,124,Barney:,"Yeah, because we're friends!
"
5,10,125,Ted (2030):,"While I was running through the city to return to the bar, your Aunt Robin was doing his best to keep Jim away from Maggie.
"
5,10,126,Jim:,"You could go to the bar, Maggie is still there?
"
5,10,127,Robin:,"Oh, it's not possible! I love pictures of dogs ironic. You got it there with the dog Welsh dwarf who is a missionary?
"
5,10,128,Jim:,"I'll take a taxi, I feel bad for leaving Maggie alone.
"
5,10,129,Robin:,"And if you took a glass of wine first? (It shatters his glass on it voluntarily) Oooh boy! I'm dirty, it's me! I'm just a dirty, dirty girl... that would defeat the second base with a friend of a friend.Tui love it! It's pig!
"
5,10,130,Jim:,"I'll call Maggie to see what it does.
"
5,10,131,Robin:,"Oh my God, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Leave her alone!Lord, she goes out with Ted tonight.
"
5,10,132,Jim:,"Ted? And Devon?
"
5,10,133,Robin:,"They have broken.
"
5,10,134,Jim:,"Maggie is single?
"
5,10,135,Robin:,"It tells me nothing!
"
5,10,136,Server:,"I can remove it? Please?
"
5,10,137,"Ted, always current:","I hate Barney Stinson!
"
5,10,138,Voice:,"Me too!
"
5,10,139,Ted (2030):,"Lily finally arrived at GNB. But the place was deserted.
"
5,10,140,Lily:,"Hey baby! I thought you came here to resign... I forgot the basket.
"
5,10,141,Marshall:,"Yeah, I thought so... so I got to do something on this list I will feel more so old so I... I came here to dunk.
"
5,10,142,Lily:,"Do it helped you feel better?
"
5,10,143,Marshall:,"I just touches the bottom of the net. You know my legs are so bad that I have a hard time getting approved.
"
5,10,144,Barney:,"Really...
"
5,10,145,Ted:,"How could you?
"
5,10,146,Barney:,"I'm challenged to have s*x with overalls. And if you stay on my path, then you let Barney win. And you do not want that!This place will never tell us the end of history.
"
5,10,147,Jim:,"Thank God! Maggie! (Ted and Barney stops him) I love that girl.
"
5,10,148,Ted:,"Put yourself on the line Bob!
"
5,10,149,Barney:,"Yeah, I'll sleep with her. After, he'll tell her he loves her.And you can do... what you want. Is there agreement on the order?
"
5,10,150,"Robin, Jim:","Sir! You just missed... the night of your life! The night... of your life.
"
5,10,151,Jim:,"I'm in love with her for 5 years!
"
5,10,152,Ted:,"I'm in love with her for 12 years!
"
5,10,153,Barney:,"I wear this jumpsuit since 1:30!
"
5,10,154,Lily:,"Maybe you can not dunk now. But you did more in 30 years that this 15 year old could have dreamed. You are a graduate of law. You had the good sense to cut you that stupid ponytail. And, you married this super bomb that is unlike any points to your mother. This entitles you to 30 cm less to dunk. (She drops a little basket) Go ahead Thunder vanilla!
"
5,10,155,Marshall:,"remote!
"
5,10,156,Lily:,"Oh, Baby! And if instead of going to dunk on your desk... you allongeras and I'd put the banana oil everywhere?
"
5,10,157,Marshall:,"Sure baby. Why we would not do that here?
"
5,10,158,Lily:,"Sure baby.
"
5,10,159,Ted:,"Guys, guys, guys! We must fix that.
"
5,10,160,Jim:,"We continue to negotiate until we have a very small window of opportunity.
"
5,10,161,Barney:,"Guys, let me assure you that if you let me... the window will reopen in about 10 minutes.
"
5,10,162,Ted:,"Wait, where is Maggie?
"
5,10,163,Robin:,"She's gone!
"
5,10,164,Ted:,"What?
"
5,10,165,Robin:,"I told him to return. You were like vultures... fighting for his carcass. Let her be single for once.
"
5,10,166,Jim:,"What enfoirée!
"
5,10,167,Ted:,"Wait, she's right. Maggie deserves a little time for her.Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a break but... This is where we discover who we really are... and what you really want. She deserves it!
"
5,10,168,Ted (2030):,"Children, I thought. That's why I'm not proud of what he was after...
"
5,10,169,"Ted, in front of Maggie:","It was after the corner!
"
5,10,170,Ted:,"Oh, sorry, the course we had a little... Who is it?
"
5,10,171,Maggie:,"It's Adam. It's crazy, we grew up together was not forced to see since...
"
5,10,172,Adam:,"Very long time!
"
5,10,173,Ted (2030):,".. That's when Maggie told us the second most beautiful love story I heard.
"
5,10,174,Adam:,"I just moved to town and I've grown up a bit.
"
5,10,175,Maggie:,"I think you have much to catch up.
"
5,10,176,Ted:,"Yeah, sure!
"
5,10,177,Ted (2030):,"So the kids, I'm left with... the neighbor because the neighbor.
"
5,10,178,Ted:,"Well... I'll see you next time!
"
5,10,179,Ted (2030):,"There was never a next time. The window of Maggie never reopened.
"
5,10,180,Barney:,"Well, I found! There are bars country, ""the giddy ups"", there are tons of guys in overalls. Copilot me!
"
5,10,181,Ted:,"I do not want the ""giddy ups."" That's what I want. I had forgotten how it felt to seeking the real thing... but I think I'm ready again.
"
5,10,182,Barney:,"Let me tell you where I am... I want to sleep with a girl in order to remove this jumpsuit. (From Ted) Go, go. You gotta help me, I have to remove this damn thing.
"
5,10,183,Older woman:,"Hey you! I love your overalls!
"
5,10,184,Marshall:,"Dear Marshall 60 years... Now you would work in a place that contributes to a better world. Or at least you try. No pressure man! I mean, sir. So... If time travel is possible, could you give me a little sign? Tuesday, December 8 at 8:29 p.m.....
"
5,10,185,Lily:,"Someone sent these chicken wings because they were too hot. I do... too hot, you're crazy? So chicken wings free.
"
5,10,186,Marshall:,"Old Marshall, as long as you're married to Lily you'll be fine.
"
5,10,187,Waitress at the old Marshall:,"Sir, it is for us. Sorry that the wings were so hot.
"
5,10,188,Old Marshall:,"Oh dear, it's not that they were too hot. It's just that I've ever had before. Much earlier!
"
5,4,1,Ted (2030):,"It was the Fall of 2009 and I was a professor now. So I decided to change my look a little bit. And people were noticing.
"
5,4,2,Barney:,"Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch.
"
5,4,3,Marshall:,"You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.
"
5,4,4,Barney:,"Because the people who wear them are constantly going, ""Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?""
"
5,4,5,Ted:,"You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.
"
5,4,6,Robin:,"You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things.
"
5,4,7,Lily:,"So guys, Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.
"
5,4,8,Robin:,"Uh, sure. Why not?
"
5,4,9,Ted (2030):,"For years, Marshall and Lily had been the only married couple in a group full
"
5,4,10,Lily:,"Welcome.
"
5,4,11,Marshall:,"(holding a tray)Gouda?
"
5,4,12,Ted (2030):,"They sucked at it.
"
5,4,13,Lily:,"This is great. We're having fun. You're having fun, right?
"
5,4,14,Marshall:,"So, should we just go ahead and lock the four of us in for new year's?
"
5,4,15,Guy:,"Um, it's April.
"
5,4,16,Marshall:,"Right. Sorry. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk Thanksgiving.
"
5,4,17,Lily:,"Our parents really want to meet you!
"
5,4,18,Guy:,"Well, we should probably be going.
"
5,4,19,Marshall:,"Wait. But, wait, if you leave now, Colonel mustard just gets away with it.
"
5,4,20,Woman:,"It's getting pretty late. We're going to go.
"
5,4,21,Lily:,"(blocking their way) There's still pie.
"
5,4,22,Marshall:,"Tonight was fantastic. We should do it again.
"
5,4,23,Man:,"I'm sorry, Marshall, but Falguni and I are just not that into you. And you.
"
5,4,24,Ted (2030):,"But just when Lily and Marshall were about to give up, two of their best friends in the world got together. And hope returned to their hearts.
"
5,4,25,Lily:,"(flashback when she saw Robin and Barney kissing) Wohoo!
"
5,4,26,Ted (2030):,"So when Lily said...
"
5,4,27,Lily:,"Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.
"
5,4,28,Robin:,"Um, sure, why not?
"
5,4,29,Ted (2030):,"Barney and Robin had no idea what they were about to walk into.
"
5,4,30,Lily:,"Okay. Game time. Let's review the flow of the room. (moving in the room) Barney and Robin enter here. Stop here for margaritas. That's a great conversation starter. We can tell them about nour trip to Cabo.
"
5,4,31,Marshall:,"Great, 'cause I got that story about Sammy Hagar Anthe Belgian waffle locked and loaded.
"
5,4,32,Lily:,"Then we'll move on to the hot apps station. And, depending on how things are going, Some lively pre-dinner charades.
"
5,4,33,Marshall:,"Right, but, uh, we'll play that one by... (showing his ears)
"
5,4,34,Lily:,"Sounds like?
"
5,4,35,Marshall:,"Okay, you can be Robin's partner.
"
5,4,36,Lily:,"Oh... Baby, we can do this.
"
5,4,37,Lily:,"Welcome.
"
5,4,38,Marshall:,"Gouda?
"
5,4,39,Ted (2030):,"Meanwhile, my half-baked theory that ladies dig the professor look was actually proving to be true.
"
5,4,40,Girl:,"So is it hard to grade papers?
"
5,4,41,Ted:,"No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a shot. I'm trashed right now, and I blame our public school system.
"
5,4,42,Ted (2030):,"Sometimes things just seem to magically fall into place.
"
5,4,43,Girl:,"So, you said you live right upstairs...
"
5,4,44,Ted (2030):,"Whether it's in the dating world...
"
5,4,45,Lily:,"Take care. Bye.
"
5,4,46,Ted (2030):,"Or the double-dating world.
"
5,4,47,Lily:,"Nailed it!
"
5,4,48,Marshall:,"Best night ever!
"
5,4,49,Barney:,"(in the corridor) Worst night ever.
"
5,4,50,Ted:,"Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?
"
5,4,51,Robin:,"Brutal.
"
5,4,52,Ted:,"Really? How?
"
5,4,53,Barney:,"It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.
"
5,4,54,Robin:,"And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.
"
5,4,55,Lily:,"Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita?
"
5,4,56,Marshall:,"In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!
"
5,4,57,Barney:,"And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.
"
5,4,58,Ted:,"Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?
"
5,4,59,Robin:,"Yeah, how'd you know?
"
5,4,60,Ted:,"Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.
"
5,4,61,Lily:,"That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.
"
5,4,62,Marshall:,"You guys are going to want to get in on thisgouda.
"
5,4,63,Lily:,"That's seared scallops with a mango chutney.
"
5,4,64,Marshall:,"Seriously, don't sleep on thegouda.
"
5,4,65,Lily:,"And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil.
"
5,4,66,Marshall:,"Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.
"
5,4,67,Barney:,"Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.
"
5,4,68,Robin:,"P.S., not sitting great.
"
5,4,69,Barney:,"And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.
"
5,4,70,Lily:,"What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?
"
5,4,71,Marshall:,"I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them.
"
5,4,72,Lily:,"Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. ( she laughs): You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall.
"
5,4,73,Ted:,"Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.
"
5,4,74,Robin:,"Show him.
"
5,4,75,Barney:,"This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night. (he takes a computer) It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.
"
5,4,76,Marshall (voice):,"It was the best night ever laughter raining down like April showers oh, we talked for hours... best night ever...
"
5,4,77,Ted:,"oh, that's not good.
"
5,4,78,Marshall (always singing in the video):,"Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day.
"
5,4,79,Barney:,"Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.
"
5,4,80,Ted:,"I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?
"
5,4,81,Barney:,"I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much.
"
5,4,82,Marshall:,"Oh.
"
5,4,83,Robin:,"Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.
"
5,4,84,Barney:,"Let's do it again, soon.
"
5,4,85,Robin:,"Yeah, we'll call you.
"
5,4,86,Ted:,"They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?
"
5,4,87,Robin:,"Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date.
"
5,4,88,Girl:,"Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'll...uh, call you.
"
5,4,89,Ted:,"Right?
"
5,4,90,Robin:,"Who was that?
"
5,4,91,Ted:,"Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.
"
5,4,92,Barney:,"Uh, no, it doesn't.
"
5,4,93,Ted:,"Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.
"
5,4,94,Barney:,"Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?
"
5,4,95,Ted:,"Westchester. Why?
"
5,4,96,Barney:,"(he laughs) You're the sexless innkeeper.
"
5,4,97,Robin:,"Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!
"
5,4,98,Ted:,"What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""?
"
5,4,99,Barney:,"Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?
"
5,4,100,Ted:,"Not really.
"
5,4,101,Barney:,"T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens. (2008, the whole story of Barney is illustrated with images) The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...
"
5,4,102,Ted:,"Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?
"
5,4,103,Barney:,"Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you
"
5,4,104,Ted:,"Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?
"
5,4,105,Barney:,"Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket
"
5,4,106,Ted:,"No way.
"
5,4,107,Barney:,"I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.
"
5,4,108,Robin:,"Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!
"
5,4,109,Lily:,"Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.
"
5,4,110,Robin:,"We have. Go on.
"
5,4,111,Lily:,"Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!
"
5,4,112,Robin:,"Wait, you guys were serious about that?
"
5,4,113,Marshall:,"Oh, we never joke about b&b's, especially at the height of syrup season.
"
5,4,114,Lily:,"Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.
"
5,4,115,Marshall:,"And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.
"
5,4,116,Barney:,"Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth. (he sighs) The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.
"
5,4,117,Lily:,"Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.
"
5,4,118,Marshall:,"Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.
"
5,4,119,Lily:,"What's going on?
"
5,4,120,Robin:,"Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.
"
5,4,121,Barney:,"Plus, the alien thing.
"
5,4,122,Lily:,"Come on,Marshall.
"
5,4,123,Marshall:,"Let's go.
"
5,4,124,Robin:,"No...Lily...
"
5,4,125,Marshall:,"You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.
"
5,4,126,Barney:,"I think they bought it.
"
5,4,127,Marshall:,"I can't believe they broke up with us.
"
5,4,128,Lily:,"We're so lovable.
"
5,4,129,Marshall:,"No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.
"
5,4,130,Lily:,"I thought we did everything right.
"
5,4,131,Marshall:,"I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.
"
5,4,132,Lily:,"Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.
"
5,4,133,Ted (2030):,"It was true.Marshall had become addicted to creating songs and photo montages documenting various mundane events. So for months, all of Marshall's friends and professional colleagues were getting e-mails like this...
"
5,4,134,Marshall (singing on the video):,"ordered Chinese food today some moo shu pork sauce got away flipped the cushion, now everything's okay.
"
5,4,135,Marshall:,"Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. (in the video,Marshall let the cats going out by the window)
"
5,4,136,Marshall:,"Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...
"
5,4,137,Lily:,"I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.
"
5,4,138,Marshall:,"If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.
"
5,4,139,Lily:,"Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.
"
5,4,140,Marshall:,"One thing? (Lily nods) One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?
"
5,4,141,Lily:,"You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!
"
5,4,142,Ted:,"Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.
"
5,4,143,Barney:,"Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?
"
5,4,144,Ted:,"Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.
"
5,4,145,Barney:,"To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?
"
5,4,146,Ted:,"Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.
"
5,4,147,Robin:,"You're right.
"
5,4,148,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
5,4,149,Robin:,"All that sexlessness has made you wise.
"
5,4,150,Ted:,"For god's sake!
"
5,4,151,Barney:,"Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.
"
5,4,152,Ted (2030):,"But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology.
"
5,4,153,Robin:,"Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.
"
5,4,154,Lily:,"Oh. I wish you had called.
"
5,4,155,Marshall:,"(to a couple, inside the apartment) I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle!
"
5,4,156,Guy:,"Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying thisgouda!
"
5,4,157,Marshall:,"Oh!
"
5,4,158,Lily:,"Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.
"
5,4,159,Robin:,"Wait. We just want...
"
5,4,160,Marshall:,"Hey! Hey, guys.
"
5,4,161,Barney:,"Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.
"
5,4,162,Lily:,"Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.
"
5,4,163,Marshall:,"Yeah, sorry.
"
5,4,164,Robin:,"Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.
"
5,4,165,Barney:,"Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.
"
5,4,166,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
5,4,167,Lily:,"Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.
"
5,4,168,Barney:,"Who the hell are these people?
"
5,4,169,Lily:,"They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie
"
5,4,170,Marshall:,"Mmm!
"
5,4,171,Lily:,"And Shea, well... She's...
"
5,4,172,Marshall:,"Shea...Shea is just...
"
5,4,173,Lily:,"Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.
"
5,4,174,Robin:,"Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.
"
5,4,175,Marshall:,"Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two. (he touches the table) Ooh.
"
5,4,176,Robin:,"Pfft, who needs 'em?
"
5,4,177,Barney:,"Pfft. Not us.
"
5,4,178,Barney and Robin are walking sadly in the street. We can hear a song:,"
"
5,4,179,Robin:,"Hi. Two for dinner.
"
5,4,180,Woman:,"Just the two of you?
"
5,4,181,Barney:,"Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.
"
5,4,182,Robin:,"After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.
"
5,4,183,Ted:,"Hey, guys.
"
5,4,184,Ted:,"Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?
"
5,4,185,Barney:,"Maybe. But they're Armani.
"
5,4,186,Ted:,"Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?
"
5,4,187,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah!
"
5,4,188,Girl:,"That was amazing, Lily!
"
5,4,189,Lily:,"I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, ""what?!""
"
5,4,190,Guy:,"You guys are the best.
"
5,4,191,Marshall:,"Oh, right back at you!
"
5,4,192,Robin and Barney:,"Ding.
"
5,4,193,Robin:,"For charades.
"
5,4,194,Lily:,"How do we know you two won't hurt us again?
"
5,4,195,Robin:,"You don't.
"
5,4,196,Marshall:,"You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.
"
5,4,197,Barney:,"Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?
"
5,4,198,Lily:,"Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?
"
5,4,199,Marshall:,"I think we can change them.
"
5,4,200,Lily:,"Come here, you two.
"
5,4,201,Barney:,"We'll never sleep on thegouda again.
"
5,4,202,Ted:,"Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?
"
5,4,203,Barney:,"No, not really.
"
5,4,204,Ted:,"'twas the night before, I had hours to kill. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.
"
5,4,205,Barney:,"With quill?
"
5,4,206,Ted:,"Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.
"
5,4,207,Barney:,"No way. You made that up.
"
5,4,208,Girl:,"Are you coming back bed, professor?
"
5,4,209,Barney:,"Whew!
"
5,4,210,Ted:,"God, I love being single.
"
5,4,211,Robin:,"Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?
"
5,4,212,Marshall:,"(worried) What have I done?
"
5,4,213,Ted:,"Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?
"
5,4,214,Robin:,"Brutal.
"
5,4,215,Ted:,"Really? How?
"
5,4,216,Barney:,"It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.
"
5,4,217,Robin:,"And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.
"
5,4,218,Lily:,"Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita?
"
5,4,219,Marshall:,"In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!
"
5,4,220,Barney:,"And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.
"
5,4,221,Ted:,"Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?
"
5,4,222,Robin:,"Yeah, how'd you know?
"
5,4,223,Ted:,"Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.
"
5,4,224,Lily:,"That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.
"
5,4,225,Marshall:,"You guys are going to want to get in on thisgouda.
"
5,4,226,Lily:,"That's seared scallops with a mango chutney.
"
5,4,227,Marshall:,"Seriously, don't sleep on thegouda.
"
5,4,228,Lily:,"And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil.
"
5,4,229,Marshall:,"Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.
"
5,4,230,Barney:,"Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.
"
5,4,231,Robin:,"P.S., not sitting great.
"
5,4,232,Barney:,"And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.
"
5,4,233,Lily:,"What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?
"
5,4,234,Marshall:,"I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them.
"
5,4,235,Lily:,"Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. ( she laughs): You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall.
"
5,4,236,Ted:,"Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.
"
5,4,237,Robin:,"Show him.

5,4,290,Marshall:,"I can't believe they broke up with us.
"
5,4,291,Lily:,"We're so lovable.
"
5,4,292,Marshall:,"No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.
"
5,4,293,Lily:,"I thought we did everything right.
"
5,4,294,Marshall:,"I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.
"
5,4,295,Lily:,"Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.
"
5,4,296,Ted (2030):,"It was true.Marshall had become addicted to creating songs and photo montages documenting various mundane events. So for months, all of Marshall's friends and professional colleagues were getting e-mails like this...
"
5,4,297,Marshall (singing on the video):,"ordered Chinese food today some moo shu pork sauce got away flipped the cushion, now everything's okay.
"
5,4,298,Marshall:,"Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. (in the video,Marshall let the cats going out by the window)
"
5,4,299,Marshall:,"Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...
"
5,4,300,Lily:,"I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.
"
5,4,301,Marshall:,"If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.
"
5,4,302,Lily:,"Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.
"
5,4,303,Marshall:,"One thing? (Lily nods) One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?
"
5,4,304,Lily:,"You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!
"
5,4,305,Ted:,"Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.
"
5,4,306,Barney:,"Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?
"
5,4,307,Ted:,"Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.
"
5,4,308,Barney:,"To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?
"
5,4,309,Ted:,"Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.
"
5,4,310,Robin:,"You're right.
"
5,4,311,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
5,4,312,Robin:,"All that sexlessness has made you wise.
"
5,4,313,Ted:,"For god's sake!
"
5,4,314,Barney:,"Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.
"
5,4,315,Ted (2030):,"But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology.
"
5,4,316,Robin:,"Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.
"
5,4,317,Lily:,"Oh. I wish you had called.
"
5,4,318,Marshall:,"(to a couple, inside the apartment) I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle!
"
5,4,319,Guy:,"Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying thisgouda!
"
5,4,320,Marshall:,"Oh!
"
5,4,321,Lily:,"Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.
"
5,4,322,Robin:,"Wait. We just want...
"
5,4,323,Marshall:,"Hey! Hey, guys.
"
5,4,324,Barney:,"Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.
"
5,4,325,Lily:,"Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.
"
5,4,326,Marshall:,"Yeah, sorry.
"
5,4,327,Robin:,"Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.
"
5,4,328,Barney:,"Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.
"
5,4,329,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
5,4,330,Lily:,"Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.
"
5,4,331,Barney:,"Who the hell are these people?
"
5,4,332,Lily:,"They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie
"
5,4,333,Marshall:,"Mmm!
"
5,4,334,Lily:,"And Shea, well... She's...
"
5,4,335,Marshall:,"Shea...Shea is just...
"
5,4,336,Lily:,"Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.
"
5,4,337,Robin:,"Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.
"
5,4,338,Marshall:,"Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two. (he touches the table) Ooh.
"
5,4,339,Robin:,"Pfft, who needs 'em?
"
5,4,340,Barney:,"Pfft. Not us.
"
5,4,341,Barney and Robin are walking sadly in the street. We can hear a song:,"
"
5,4,342,Robin:,"Hi. Two for dinner.
"
5,4,343,Woman:,"Just the two of you?
"
5,4,344,Barney:,"Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.
"
5,4,345,Robin:,"After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.
"
5,4,346,Ted:,"Hey, guys.
"
5,4,347,Ted:,"Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?
"
5,4,348,Barney:,"Maybe. But they're Armani.
"
5,4,349,Ted:,"Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?
"
5,4,350,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah!
"
5,4,351,Girl:,"That was amazing, Lily!
"
5,4,352,Lily:,"I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, ""what?!""
"
5,4,353,Guy:,"You guys are the best.
"
5,4,354,Marshall:,"Oh, right back at you!
"
5,4,355,Robin and Barney:,"Ding.
"
5,4,356,Robin:,"For charades.
"
5,4,357,Lily:,"How do we know you two won't hurt us again?
"
5,4,358,Robin:,"You don't.
"
5,4,359,Marshall:,"You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.
"
5,4,360,Barney:,"Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?
"
5,4,361,Lily:,"Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?
"
5,4,362,Marshall:,"I think we can change them.
"
5,4,363,Lily:,"Come here, you two.
"
5,4,364,Barney:,"We'll never sleep on thegouda again.
"
5,4,365,Ted:,"Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?
"
5,4,366,Barney:,"No, not really.
"
5,4,367,Ted:,"'twas the night before, I had hours to kill. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.
"
5,4,368,Barney:,"With quill?
"
5,4,369,Ted:,"Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.
"
5,4,370,Barney:,"No way. You made that up.
"
5,4,371,Girl:,"Are you coming back bed, professor?
"
5,4,372,Barney:,"Whew!
"
5,4,373,Ted:,"God, I love being single.
"
5,4,374,Robin:,"Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?
"
5,4,375,Marshall:,"(worried) What have I done?
"
5,5,1,Ted (2030):,"Kids, as you know, Aunt Robin grew up in Canada. That meant sometimes she dressed &agrave; little differently.
"
5,5,2,Robin:,"Okay, let's do this!
"
5,5,3,Ted (2030):,"Sometimes she talked a little differently.
"
5,5,4,Robin:,"Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh?
"
5,5,5,Ted (2030):,"She hung out at different bars and enjoyed leisure time a little differently.
"
5,5,6,fighting:,"You want to go? You want to go?! Come on! (In McLaren's...) Make fun of the Great White North all you want. It's the best country in the world.
"
5,5,7,Barney:,"The... mmm. Social experiment. (Chanting) U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A...
"
5,5,8,Robin:,"Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in. (Chanting) Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything.
"
5,5,9,"Barney, singing:","Shrimp fried rice...
"
5,5,10,All singing:,"Shrimp fried rice, shrimp fried rice...
"
5,5,11,"Ted, joining them:","Shrimp fried rice totally. Anyway, speaking of food, Marshall, I've got so bad news. Just read online, Gazzola's is closing.
"
5,5,12,Marshall:,"No!
"
5,5,13,Robin:,"What Gazzola's?
"
5,5,14,Ted:,"A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.
"
5,5,15,Marshall:,"Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago just for Gazzola's pizza.
"
5,5,16,Ted:,"22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.
"
5,5,17,Marshall:,"Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros.
"
5,5,18,Ted:,"Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.
"
5,5,19,Marshall:,"Drank nothing but Tantrum.
"
5,5,20,Ted (2030):,"Ah, Tantrum. Tantrum was a soft drink with the highest caffeine content legally available over the counter. It was eventually discontinued after an extensive study by the FDA.
"
5,5,21,Marshall:,"Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip.
"
5,5,22,Ted:,"I was color blind for two weeks after that.
"
5,5,23,Marshall:,"I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells.
"
5,5,24,Ted:,"It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.
"
5,5,25,Marshall:,"So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?
"
5,5,26,Ted:,"I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.
"
5,5,27,Ted:,"I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned though the can, the other one I drank already. (He tears a pillow) Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an ""I"" to a ""We"".
"
5,5,28,Barney:,"What do you mean?
"
5,5,29,Ted:,"Think about it.
"
5,5,30,Ted:,"Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?
"
5,5,31,"Marshall, in bar with Lily:","We're doing great.
"
5,5,32,Ted:,"Do you watch the Jets game?
"
5,5,33,Marshall:,"We most certainly did.
"
5,5,34,Ted:,"How'd things go at the doctor?
"
5,5,35,Marshall:,"We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.
"
5,5,36,Barney:,"Hmm.
"
5,5,37,Robin:,"You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges.
"
5,5,38,Robin:,"Come on!
"
5,5,39,Robin:,"I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported.
"
5,5,40,Ted:,"Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!
"
5,5,41,Robin:,"Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.
"
5,5,42,Barney:,"Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.
"
5,5,43,Robin:,"Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.
"
5,5,44,Barney:,"I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.
"
5,5,45,Robin:,"Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.
"
5,5,46,Barney:,"A cit...
"
5,5,47,Robin:,"I'll think about it.
"
5,5,48,Barney:,"No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...
"
5,5,49,Robin:,"Okay, Barney.
"
5,5,50,Barney:,"Sorry. It's a rich area.
"
5,5,51,Robin:,"It is.
"
5,5,52,Barney:,"But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.
"
5,5,53,Robin:,"How do you know the Canadian test is easy?
"
5,5,54,Barney:,"It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really?
"
5,5,55,"Marshall, entering with ""a hat with drink"":","Ted! Ted! Check it out! I got black coffee on the left, I got Tantrum on the right! Do you have a phone book?!
"
5,5,56,Ted:,"Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?
"
5,5,57,Marshall:,"Tantrum!
"
5,5,58,Ted:,"Tantrum!
"
5,5,59,Lily:,"All right, let's hit the road.
"
5,5,60,Ted:,"You invited Lily?
"
5,5,61,Marshall:,"We most certainly did!
"
5,5,62,Barney:,"I don't know if you caught that, but he did the ""we"" thing.
"
5,5,63,Ted:,"Yeah, I heard him.
"
5,5,64,Barney:,"Okay.
"
5,5,65,Lily:,"Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.
"
5,5,66,Ted:,"All right, next stop: Chicago.
"
5,5,67,Lily:,"I have to pee.
"
5,5,68,Ted:,"Couldn't you have gone before we left?
"
5,5,69,Lily:,"I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.
"
5,5,70,Marshall:,"Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times.
"
5,5,71,Ted (2030):,"It wasn't.
"
5,5,72,Lily:,"Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee.
"
5,5,73,Ted:,"Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.
"
5,5,74,"Lily, fighting Ted:","Ooh, punch buggy yellow!
"
5,5,75,Ted:,"Ow!
"
5,5,76,Lily:,"Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee.
"
5,5,77,Ted:,"Thank you!
"
5,5,78,Lily:,"Great. Oh, hey, Ted...
"
5,5,79,Ted:,"You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.
"
5,5,80,Lily:,"No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something.
"
5,5,81,Ted:,"Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.
"
5,5,82,Marshall:,"Goodbye, Sparky.
"
5,5,83,Lily:,"It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.
"
5,5,84,Voice:,"Goodbye Sparky, by Nick Leotti. Read to you by Kenny Rogers.
"
5,5,85,Marshall:,"Oh!
"
5,5,86,Kenny:,"Chapter one: When I first saw Sparky, he reminded me of my favorite comb; he was missing a lot of teeth, but I loved him anyway. Mother was fit to be tied every time he used her prized rhododendron to do his business.
"
5,5,87,Lily:,"That reminds me, I have to pee.
"
5,5,88,Barney:,"""How many stars are on the flag?""
"
5,5,89,Robin:,"50, one for each state.
"
5,5,90,Barney:,"""What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?""
"
5,5,91,Robin:,"The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.
"
5,5,92,Barney:,"Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: ""Who is this?""
"
5,5,93,Robin:,"Queen Elizabeth II.
"
5,5,94,Barney:,"No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: ""What the hell is this?""
"
5,5,95,Robin:,"Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...
"
5,5,96,Barney:,"Wrong. The answer we were looking for was ""I don't care, it's dumb"". Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin.
"
5,5,97,Kenny:,"..because Sparky loved chasing a ball, and it didn't much matter what kind. Tennis ball, baseball, Wiffle ball, golf ball, basketball, beach ball, gum ball, a grapefruit- which isn't actually a ball, but's round like a ball- a football- which isn't round, but it's still technically a ball- Indian rubber ball...
"
5,5,98,Voice:,"This ends disk seven. The audio book continues on disk eight. (Ted removes the disk and puts back the other one) Disk eight.
"
5,5,99,Kenny:,"Lacrosse ball, volleyball...
"
5,5,100,Ted:,"Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!
"
5,5,101,Lily:,"Ah, I do.
"
5,5,102,Ted (2030):,"It was the worst trip ever, but then it got worse.
"
5,5,103,Marshall:,"Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there.
"
5,5,104,Ted:,"Hotel?
"
5,5,105,Woman:,"Crumpet Manor is listed in the American Registry of Historic Bed and Breakfasts. Our door is opened on Christmas day, 1881. And we have catered to couples ever since.
"
5,5,106,Marshall:,"Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?
"
5,5,107,Woman:,"Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?
"
5,5,108,Ted (2030):,"And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American.
"
5,5,109,Robin:,"I want to say- Jefferson?
"
5,5,110,Barney:,"Correct.
"
5,5,111,Robin:,"Oh!
"
5,5,112,Barney:,"Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.
"
5,5,113,Robin:,"Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!
"
5,5,114,Barney:,"All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?
"
5,5,115,Robin:,"That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.
"
5,5,116,Barney:,"Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?
"
5,5,117,Robin:,"Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.
"
5,5,118,Barney:,"Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your guns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.
"
5,5,119,Woman:,"Look who's back from the wishing well.
"
5,5,120,Ted:,"It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.
"
5,5,121,Marshall:,"Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.
"
5,5,122,Lily:,"Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?
"
5,5,123,Woman:,"All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?
"
5,5,124,Ted (2030):,"And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.
"
5,5,125,Marshall and Lily:,"We'd love cornmeal body scrub!
"
5,5,126,Ted:,"Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.
"
5,5,127,Robin:,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. (She throws one bottle on the floor) Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. (She crosses the road and enter into the bar) *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*
"
5,5,128,Ted:,"Hey, man.
"
5,5,129,Marshall:,"Shh.
"
5,5,130,Ted:,"Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?
"
5,5,131,Marshall:,"Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.
"
5,5,132,Marshall:,"Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?
"
5,5,133,Ted:,"Chicago.
"
5,5,134,Marshall:,"What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!
"
5,5,135,Ted:,"She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.
"
5,5,136,Marshall:,"I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?
"
5,5,137,"Marshall and Ted, singing:","*And I would walk 500 miles. And I would walk 500 more...*
"
5,5,138,Ted:,"Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?
"
5,5,139,Marshall:,"If she's pissed, she's pissed.
"
5,5,140,Ted:,"Pfft.
"
5,5,141,Ted (2030):,"When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.
"
5,5,142,Barney:,"Good morning.
"
5,5,143,Robin:,"Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?
"
5,5,144,Barney:,"You went Canadian.
"
5,5,145,Robin:,"How Canadian?
"
5,5,146,Barney:,"This Canadian. (He opens the curtains) Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.
"
5,5,147,Robin:,"Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.
"
5,5,148,Robin:,"We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.
"
5,5,149,Robin:,"How did you find me, anyway?
"
5,5,150,Barney:,"You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...
"
5,5,151,Robin:,"Canada isn't across the Atlantic.
"
5,5,152,Barney:,"You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.
"
5,5,153,Robin:,"Barney, I'm not taking the test.
"
5,5,154,Barney:,"God, you're still drunk.
"
5,5,155,Robin:,"Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.
"
5,5,156,Barney:,"Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.
"
5,5,157,Ted:,"Kind of cross.
"
5,5,158,Marshall:,"You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.
"
5,5,159,Ted:,"Just like old times!
"
5,5,160,Marshall:,"I feel so young again except for the chest pains.
"
5,5,161,Ted:,"But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?
"
5,5,162,Man:,"It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.
"
5,5,163,Marshall:,"Cornmeal...
"
5,5,164,Lily:,"We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!
"
5,5,165,Ted:,"I can't believe you guys are closing.
"
5,5,166,Man:,"I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.
"
5,5,167,Barney:,"It's like an entire country without a tailor.
"
5,5,168,Robin:,"Yeah, give me two coffees.
"
5,5,169,Women:,"$3,50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night?
"
5,5,170,Robin:,"What game?
"
5,5,171,Women:,"The Leafs beat Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT.
"
5,5,172,Robin:,"Oh, I guess I missed it.
"
5,5,173,Women:,"Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change.
"
5,5,174,Robin:,"I'm not American.
"
5,5,175,Women:,"American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No ""please"" or ""thank you"" for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.
"
5,5,176,Barney:,"What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.
"
5,5,177,Robin:,"Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.
"
5,5,178,Barney:,"And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.
"
5,5,179,Marshall:,"I don't want this anymore.
"
5,5,180,Ted:,"Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.
"
5,5,181,Marshall:,"We shouldn't have left Lily.
"
5,5,182,Ted:,"Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?
"
5,5,183,Marshall:,"I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!""
"
5,5,184,Ted:,"What exactly is ""Ted's fault""?
"
5,5,185,Marshall:,"This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!
"
5,5,186,Ted:,"We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.
"
5,5,187,Marshall:,"That is not true.
"
5,5,188,Ted:,"It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.
"
5,5,189,Marshall:,"Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.
"
5,5,190,Barney:,"Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.
"
5,5,191,Robin:,"When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.
"
5,5,192,Barney:,"Okay, that's it. (He climbs on a chair) Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one: get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a ""jhoke"". Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless. (He sits down and three men arrive behind him) Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a ""tie"".
"
5,5,193,Kenny:,"Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows.
"
5,5,194,Marshall:,"I'm sorry, ted!
"
5,5,195,Ted:,"I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!
"
5,5,196,Marshall:,"No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?
"
5,5,197,Ted:,"Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?
"
5,5,198,Marshall:,"Hells, yeah!
"
5,5,199,Ted:,"Or listen to the Sparky book again?
"
5,5,200,Marshall:,"Listen to the Sparky book again.
"
5,5,201,Ted:,"Okay. Let's listen to it again.
"
5,5,202,Barney:,"Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.
"
5,5,203,Robin:,"Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool.""
"
5,5,204,Barney:,"Hmm.
"
5,5,205,Robin:,"And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.
"
5,5,206,Barney:,"Wait, you can do that?
"
5,5,207,Robin:,"Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.
"
5,5,208,Barney:,"I see.
"
5,5,209,Robin:,"You understand?
"
5,5,210,Barney:,"No, I can see out of my left eye again.
"
5,5,211,Marshall:,"Hey, baby? Baby?
"
5,5,212,Lily:,"Hmm? Yeah?
"
5,5,213,Marshall:,"I'm so sorry that we left you.
"
5,5,214,Lily:,"Did you go somewhere, sweetie?
"
5,5,215,Ted (2030):,"Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone.
"
5,5,216,Lily:,"Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...
"
5,5,217,Lily:,"So, I had a great time, too.
"
5,5,218,Marshall:,"That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.
"
5,5,219,Lily:,"Oh, that's okay.
"
5,5,220,Ted (2030):,"And if she didn't mean it then, she certainly meant it 19 minutes later.
"
5,5,221,Marshall:,"God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!
"
5,5,222,Ted:,"It's like a hot ball of lead!
"
5,5,223,Marshall:,"Baby, cut it out of me.
"
5,5,224,Marshall:,"That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?
"
5,5,225,Ted:,"I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?
"
5,5,226,Marshall:,"You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?
"
5,5,227,"Lily, on the roof of the car:","Tantrum! I have to pee.
"
5,11,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, in 2009, your Aunt Robin was the host of ""Welcome to New York."" And she was released early. How soon?
"
5,11,2,Robin:,"Mike? Wake up!
"
5,11,3,Ted (2030):,"And then everything changed.
"
5,11,4,Robin:,"Have you seen my show?
"
5,11,5,Ted:,"I wanted to watch it but I was too busy sleeping with this story. It took me all night, after 8 hours of the clock.
"
5,11,6,Robin:,"It's not serious, but listen to this! After the show...
"
5,11,7,Man:,"Are you Robin?
"
5,11,8,Robin:,"Yes.
"
5,11,9,Man:,"I'm Don, your new co-presenter.
"
5,11,10,Ted (2030):,"Don was Don Franck. A veteran of the morning shows... and a former host of 38 local programs across the country watched. This guy was a legend in the middle.
"
5,11,11,Ted:,"Wow, you're going you do too.
"
5,11,12,Robin:,"No, I just think it will be great both on the air.
"
5,11,13,Ted:,"And on the couch, the bed and on the coffee table.
"
5,11,14,Robin:,"Ok, ok, I'll go on the roof and stay there all alone 5 minutes.
"
5,11,15,Ted:,"Have fun.
"
5,11,16,Ted (2030):,"And that's exactly what she did. She just stayed there. Okay kids, I'm a little liar with you. This is not what she did.That's what she did.
"
5,11,17,Robin:,"Okay, okay, I'll go smoke a cigarette.
"
5,11,18,Children of Ted:,"What?
"
5,11,19,Ted (2030):,"I promised never to tell you. But occasionally, your Aunt Robin was enjoying a cigarette. And occasionally, the occasional cigarette. Was more than just casual.
"
5,11,20,Barney:,"I just let something like that to my apartment.
"
5,11,21,Ted:,"Robin, going, going on the roof! We said no smoking in the apartment... after that you have set fire by the pumps.
"
5,11,22,Robin:,"Okay, very good, very good.
"
5,11,23,Marshall:,"Yeah Robin, I mean my God... not only is it a bad habit but... Do I have one?
"
5,11,24,Robin:,"Of course.
"
5,11,25,Children of Ted:,"What?
"
5,11,26,Ted (2030):,"Children, your Uncle Marshall would not like at all that you know that. But he also smoked from time to time.
"
5,11,27,Ted (2030):,"It started when he was 13. During an event camping in Minnesota.
"
5,11,28,Boy:,"Come on Marshall, it's Christmas! This holiday feast!
"
5,11,29,Marshall:,"But just one. This is the first and the last cigarette of my life.
"
5,11,30,Ted (2030):,"And this was the first of many, many cigarettes last of his life.
"
5,11,31,Marshall:,"Okay, I'm done, I Quit!
"
5,11,32,Marshall:,".. last cigarette... my life.
"
5,11,33,Ted (2030):,"And then what I had heard many times before.
"
5,11,34,Marshall:,"last cigarette of my life.
"
5,11,35,Ted:,"What are you doing, you have not smoked in 6 months. Is it about ""MacGrib""? It closed guy, forget it.
"
5,11,36,Marshall:,"I'm worried about work, ok? They just hired a new chief legal department... and it will turn people.
"
5,11,37,Ted:,"So that's why you're worried?
"
5,11,38,Barney:,"The new head of legal department is Hobes Arthur.
"
5,11,39,Ted:,"Is Arthur artillery? Your former leader.
"
5,11,40,Ted (2030):,"Arthur Hobes is the worst leaders as Marshall or anyone have had. The last time Marshall had worked for him... it ended like that.
"
5,11,41,Marshall:,"I quit!
"
5,11,42,Ted:,"Is it always rebounded against you?
"
5,11,43,Marshall:,"Worse!
"
5,11,44,Arthur:,"Sorry, who are you?
"
5,11,45,Marshall:,"I have Marshall Eriksen. We had a pretty intense argument. As I've suggested that you take your head and you put yourself in the..., inside you. At a place that could reduce its exposure to the sun.
"
5,11,46,Arthur:,"Yeah, that describes 95% of my employees and my family. Except my dog. It's such a good boy. Well, I'll see you later... um Rendal Rilgurson.
"
5,11,47,Marshall:,"Marshall Eriksen.
"
5,11,48,Arthur:,"The film Gary Taker, right?
"
5,11,49,Ted:,"Wow, he not remember you.
"
5,11,50,Barney:,"Not great, it does not matter that Arthur Hobes not like Marshall, he loves no one. It is the people he knows that he has to separate. He just fired, ""What's his head? "".
"
5,11,51,Marshall:,"It turned 'What is his head? ""Ted! And ""What's his head? ""Was priceless.
"
5,11,52,Ted:,"Look, I understand you to be upset but this is not a reason to kill you.
"
5,11,53,Barney:,"Yeah, after you turn'm doing... then you can kill you. As ""What is his head? "". Now I think it is, where is his head?
"
5,11,54,Marshall:,"Look, it's just two cigarettes. Ok, I can collect 2. As it is not 3 within 24hrs I replongerai yet.
"
5,11,55,Ted:,"What will Lily say when you learn that you smoked?
"
5,11,56,Marshall:,"Lily did not discover. I have a system.
"
5,11,57,Ted (2030):,"Oh, yes, the system of Marshall.
"
5,11,58,Marshall:,"Well, Lil '!
"
5,11,59,Lily:,"You got smoked!
"
5,11,60,Marshall:,"Damn!
"
5,11,61,Ted (2030):,"The next morning, your Aunt Robin was finally launched. She finally went on air with a real pro.
"
5,11,62,Mike:,"In 3... 2... 1...
"
5,11,63,Robin:,"Hello, I'm Robin Scherbatsky!
"
5,11,64,Don:,"And I'm Don... Frank! Two teenagers were arrested yesterday for stealing a police truck. No, I'm sorry not a cart, a police car. Damn! Brain fart! You with me? Oh, look at the teleprompter is still running. Something about a woman giving birth... on a bus. Well, we will not resume in the middle, we'll wait until the end. And, she cut the cord with a metro ticket. We come back! And it's good!
"
5,11,65,Robin:,"But what was that? Don, you said Pet brain!
"
5,11,66,Don:,"Robin, you're a bit like a nice kid but this is my 39th local newspaper. And all this time I learned three things: prevention of all sushi restaurants at will before work. Do not go to the bathroom while you're still on the air. And 3: at this time, all your audience... it's a guy who is half drunk and in his underwear.
"
5,11,67,Mike:,"Back in 5... 4...
"
5,11,68,Robin:,"Well, let a good program for what is half drunk.
"
5,11,69,Don:,"The guy in half drunk thank you.
"
5,11,70,Ted (2030):,"The next day, Marshall was so crave a cigarette it made him mad. So he decided to take a little air.
"
5,11,71,Arthur:,"Oh, no! You're not here to jump, does not it? I have turned many people today... and I would not do another jump ruin my record. Oh, cigarettes?
"
5,11,72,Marshall:,"No, no thank you!
"
5,11,73,Arthur:,"Too bad! Geoffrey you know why I miss? We used to smoke. People are now replaceable. But you share a cigarette with someone and you have a real link.
"
5,11,74,Marshall:,"You know what? I'll take one.
"
5,11,75,Arthur:,"Ok!
"
5,11,76,Marshall:,"Marshall I am aware. It was Marshall, Marshall Eriksen.
"
5,11,77,Arthur:,"Tell me something Marshall Eriksen. Would you like to see a photo of the cutest dogs in the world? Good boy!
"
5,11,78,Marshall:,"Hey!
"
5,11,79,Lily:,"You got smoked!
"
5,11,80,Marshall:,"Yes, I smoked! And it was my third day. You know what that means? I'm a smoker now. Everything is ruined. I bought a packet coming back, and a lighter... and a Viking lamp that has nothing to do, but I saw in the window and I liked it.
"
5,11,81,Lily:,"Damn Marshall. It has four lamps and Viking smoking kills.
"
5,11,82,Marshall:,"It was to create a link with my boss, you should have seen me up there.
"
5,11,83,Marshall:,"It's a beautiful dog. And it is your children?
"
5,11,84,Chief:,"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hey, hey, look what I got at the supermarket! (He shows his t-shirt under his shirt) he is! There he is! Go ahead, pet him now! Yeah, go! He loves it. Caress her chin!
"
5,11,85,Lily:,"I do not care about your reasons, you know what I think of smoking. Now give me the cigarettes! And the lighter. (Lily lights a cigarette) Aaah, that thing!
"
5,11,86,Children of Ted:,"What!
"
5,11,87,Ted (2030):,"Oh yes, add your aunt Lily in the list! While your Uncle Marshall has relapsed, your aunt Lily has been trained with him.
"
5,11,88,Don:,"What are you doing?
"
5,11,89,Robin:,"You should know that I tried to contact the town hall so we could get the mayor on the show.
"
5,11,90,Don:,"My God, you are adorable. The mayor does not come in emissions that no one is watching. My colonoscopy was more viewership. It was well twisted I admit.
"
5,11,91,Robin:,"I do not know why you act like that. Maybe you've never had a better job offer, but I still can, so I really want to focus.
"
5,11,92,Don:,"I've already spent on the cable.
"
5,11,93,Robin:,"You're already past the cable?
"
5,11,94,Don:,"It was the best weekend of my life. When you do the newspaper, you're sitting on ergonomic seats, you feel like sitting on a cloud, which was good also because it was just after my colonoscopy. And the locker room, wow.
"
5,11,95,Mike:,"There are changing rooms?
"
5,11,96,Don:,"Oh yes there was the break, Mike. We will not change in the toilets of KFC on the other side of the street. Oh no. It was heaven. But once you get used to, they will not care at the door to find someone who is not undergoing divorce, or who is not addicted to gin. And before you know it, you find yourself in a dead end, surrounded by people who are going nowhere in their careers, making these programs in their underwear.
"
5,11,97,Robin:,"ok, the trick underwear was your choice. And I would not keep that going.
"
5,11,98,Don:,"You are beautiful guys. It's comfortable eh?
"
5,11,99,Robin:,"I want to kill him, of course people watching this show.You look at her. My God, you still have not seen the program.
"
5,11,100,Lily:,"We saw.
"
5,11,101,Robin:,"Really? What color is the decor?
"
5,11,102,Marshall:,"It's black, or silver.
"
5,11,103,Robin:,"Not your TV, the decor of my show. If my best friends do not watch, will watch it...
"
5,11,104,Marshall:,"A lot of people... Bedrin the insomniac, who portrays Blongs front of department stores. People to the emergency room where the TV is in a cage, and you can not change channels.
"
5,11,105,Robin:,"You have film crews?
"
5,11,106,Ted:,"I can not believe they're smoking outside, it's really cold.
"
5,11,107,Barney:,"Do you remember when you could smoke in bars?
"
5,11,108,Ted:,"I think there's a pretty girl smiling at me there.
"
5,11,109,Barney:,"Hey, this is a chair, but go ahead and drag it.
"
5,11,110,Ted:,"Guys?
"
5,11,111,Marshall:,"Marco?
"
5,11,112,Ted and Barney:,"Polo!
"
5,11,113,Ted:,"Our group is divided into smokers and nonsmokers, and it's great.
"
5,11,114,Barney:,"You're right. Going for a smoke.
"
5,11,115,Children of Ted:,"What?
"
5,11,116,Ted (2030):,"Yes, I'm not proud.
"
5,11,117,Robin:,"Hey you two, smoking, like us.
"
5,11,118,Barney:,"I'm not a smoker. I do not smoke on certain occasions.After s*x, when I'm with German, sometimes both at the same time. During s*x, for birthdays, to annoy my mother, just before s*x, on a sailboat. The day the mentor MC mailly eliminated each year, and of course... wait, because God knows it's true: fear of pregnancy.
"
5,11,119,Ted:,"And why you smoke there?
"
5,11,120,Barney:,"I'm always on the verge of sleep Ted.
"
5,11,121,Lily:,"Maybe that smoking is not so bad, at least it is outdoors.
"
5,11,122,Barney:,"And my abs muscle nicotine. I... am... muscular.
"
5,11,123,Ted (2030):,"As glamorous as it might be, we all cracked after one week.
"
5,11,124,Marshall:,"It's alright, darling?
"
5,11,125,"Lily, with a deep voice:","Actually, my throat is a little dry.
"
5,11,126,Arthur:,"So I teased him a little with the newspaper like that, and my wife said, you can not treat your son as well. Michael calls for help.
"
5,11,127,Marshall:,"Yes, right away, and me is Marshall.
"
5,11,128,Barney:,"My God, I hope that Arthur is well. I reserve her office in case.
"
5,11,129,Ted:,"We must stop smoking.
"
5,11,130,"Lily, with a deep voice:","Baby, you said it was going.
"
5,11,131,Marshall:,"I would never have started. I finally revisit in 13 years, if I could go back. (Young Marshall went camping with a buddy and they smoke. Older Marshall arrives and pat the hand of young Marshall to drop the cigarette. It gives him a punch in the stomach) I hate that little b*st*rd.
"
5,11,132,Lily:,"Me too.
"
5,11,133,Ted:,"Ok it's good, we stop.
"
5,11,134,Marshall:,"Yes, we stop.
"
5,11,135,Barney:,"I'm proud of you guys. I heard how it was difficult to stop smoking for as you, then the part of non-smokers, I tell you hat, so give me your cigarettes and I rid, one at a time.
"
5,11,136,Lily:,"You stop my chick. (She removes the cigarette from his hands) I know I did not call you chick normally, but it does with that voice. Chick.
"
5,11,137,Robin:,"Guys, I wonder, you also are interviewing the mayor tomorrow, or it just me? Don was in the teeth, while I'm smoking a. Lighter Marshall.
"
5,11,138,Marshall:,"Actually, we all decided to stop.
"
5,11,139,Robin:,"Fantastic, I was fed up that you piquiez me my smokes constantly.
"
5,11,140,Ted:,"Robin, we must do together.
"
5,11,141,Robin:,"No.
"
5,11,142,Lily:,"You can sleep with Marshall.
"
5,11,143,Marshall:,"Lily God, no.
"
5,11,144,Lily:,"Sorry darling, that's for the team.
"
5,11,145,Robin:,"I do not want to have s*x with Marshall.
"
5,11,146,Marshall:,"Sure.
"
5,11,147,Robin:,"I can not stop now, not before the most important interview of my life. It's too stressful.
"
5,11,148,Barney:,"It's too stressful!
"
5,11,149,Marshall:,"Just one.
"
5,11,150,Lily:,"Give a cigarette!
"
5,11,151,Ted:,"Damn Robin, think about it a moment, Blue Bug is the mayor anti cigarette. You really want to go to the interview smelling cigarettes? It's like interviewing a feeling the vegetarian steak.
"
5,11,152,Marshall:,"Really, it's hard enough like that?
"
5,11,153,Ted:,"You stop! It all stops.
"
5,11,154,Robin:,"Ok, I stop.
"
5,11,155,Ted:,"We should just spend the first 24 hours after a piece of cake.
"
5,11,156,Lily:,"Barney stops eating your fingers.
"
5,11,157,Barney:,"I do not bite my nails, I try to suck the rest of nicotine on my fingers.
"
5,11,158,Ted:,"Marshall pass me your plate.
"
5,11,159,Marshall:,"What, you're a dinosaur?
"
5,11,160,Barney:,"What do cigarettes now? You believe they think of us?
"
5,11,161,Ted:,"Dude, if you do not stop moving your feet, I'll tear it off.
"
5,11,162,Marshall:,"Oh Ted, I'm sorry, maybe I should move closer to your ass!
"
5,11,163,Ted:,"Ok we'll do it now!
"
5,11,164,Ted (2030):,"Nobody knew why we fight. We just knew we wanted to smoke more than anything. It was not great for Robin either.
"
5,11,165,"Don, who arrive without pants:","Sorry I'm late. Someone used the microwave, and I got stuck in the elevator. What are you doing?
"
5,11,166,Don:,"Oh my little princess porcelain, why would you do that?
"
5,11,167,Robin:,"Why? Because it is important to Don, the issue is important and my career. Not like you, you incompetent. You're boring, you are bad, and I want you to work at least as hard as the elastic of your underwear.
"
5,11,168,Don:,"I begin to believe that it becomes personal.
"
5,11,169,Robin:,"No gift, it would become personal if I told you that just because you pass emission issue, it's because you're losing. A loser lazy and obnoxious.
"
5,11,170,Don:,"The mayor canceled.
"
5,11,171,Mike:,"5... 4... 3... 2...
"
5,11,172,Robin:,"Hello, this is Robin Scherbatsky.
"
5,11,173,Don:,"You think I'm a loser? You're right, I'm a but at least I accept it.
"
5,11,174,Robin:,"A raccoon has bitten a patient in a nursing home.
"
5,11,175,Don:,"I was like you at first, I always wanted more, and I had nothing. This is a dead Robin, you'll never be a superstar of television. Since you never stop smoking.
"
5,11,176,Robin:,"What are you doing?
"
5,11,177,Don:,"I like my cigarette. Oh that's good. Want a latte?
"
5,11,178,Robin:,"You can be professional?
"
5,11,179,Don:,"Yes professional, you know who holds the camera? A chair, even the cameraman is not looking our show and that's why the mayor has canceled. And Mike went to fast food, and that you and I can enjoy a cigarette here.
"
5,11,180,Robin:,"No thank you.
"
5,11,181,Don:,"Why? Because there are millions of viewers? If viewers are problems with this, call us at the number on the screen: 212-555-0192. Go robin, appreciate life a little. (She takes the cigarette when the phone rings) It must be Mike, he always forgets to take them into extra-crunchy.
"
5,11,182,Marshall:,"Robin, do not smoke this cigarette.
"
5,11,183,Robin:,"Marshall?
"
5,11,184,Marshall:,"They look at you all, we are all impressed and if you smoke this cigarette, we shall return it to us too.
"
5,11,185,Robin:,"You watch the show?
"
5,11,186,Lily:,"Yes sweetie, and you are very pretty.
"
5,11,187,Robin:,"Oh guys.

5,11,188,Ted:,"You do not have to do that, you do not need to smoke.
"
5,11,189,Lily:,"Resists sweetie!

5,11,191,Marshall:,"She did!
"
5,11,192,Ted:,"Good for her.
"
5,11,193,Lily:,"We will not smoke.
"
5,11,194,Barney:,"I have a hiding on the roof.
"
5,11,195,Barney:,"Oh, I woke up and I smoke. Robin, you know how it's dangerous to wake a smoker sleeps.
"
5,11,196,Robin:,"I bought a packet on the way home.
"
5,11,197,Marshall:,"Robin Good show.
"
5,11,198,Lily:,"And this guy So what con.
"
5,11,199,Robin:,"He ended up apologizing.
"
5,11,200,Lily:,"When he got up, the forms were more revealing, you should go out with him.
"
5,11,201,Robin:,"We believe in it all.
"
5,11,202,Ted (2030):,"They went out together three months later. But we will come back.
"
5,11,203,Ted:,"Well look, the sun rises.
"
5,11,204,Robin:,"You know it's the perfect time there. For one last cigarette. The real last.
"
5,11,205,Barney:,"Come on, let's do it.

5,11,209,Robin:,".. three.
"
5,11,210,Ted (2030):,"We all stopped for a while after that. But this was not the last, even though we ended up really stop. Robin was arrested in June 2013. Barney in March 2017. Lily stopped from the moment she wanted to get pregnant. Marshall stopped when it was Dad. And my last two weeks before I met your mother, and I did most affected.
"
5,11,211,Marshall:,"Sorry to have hit my friend. I want to redeem myself by giving you this.

5,11,212,Young Marshall:,"Wow, she's pretty.

5,11,213,Marshall:,"Well one day you will marry her.

5,11,214,Marshall Young:,"For real?
