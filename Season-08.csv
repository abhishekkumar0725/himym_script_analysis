8,2,7,Marshall:,"But on this one, he may have a point. I mean, look... the idea of renegotiating the terms of the relationship, that's valid.

8,2,9,Women:,"Like what?
"
8,2,10,Narrator:,"And just like that... one of these four couples would break up the very next day.

"
8,2,18,So when you're doing the news live at 7:,"0, you wink to future you watching the rebroadcast at 11:00?

8,2,19,(sobs):,"I'm so sorry.

8,2,20,Ted:,"There is, little lady. I've got a guest room.

8,2,23,KLAUS:,"Yes, I can hear you.
"
8,2,24,(quietly):,"That's it.

8,16,3,Narrator:,"But let's back up a little bit.
"
8,16,4,Narrator:,"I had a point, and they knew it.
"
8,16,5,Narrator:,"Now, kids, what Lily didn't realize--
"
8,16,6,Narrator:,"So the next night, I met her in a public place so she wouldn't flip out.
"
8,16,7,Narrator:,"Meanwhile, Lily and Robin were out getting lunch, when disaster struck.

8,16,8,Narrator:,"Now, a few months earlier, the East Coast had been hit by a bad storm, and some intelligent, forward-thinking New Yorkers took it as a wake-up call, making sure to stock their bedrooms with enough

8,16,12,(Boston accent):,"Is she a cop?!
"
8,16,13,(Boston accent):,"I think she's a cop!
"
8,16,14,JEANETTE:,"They can stay.
"
8,16,15,Robin:,"All gone.
"
8,16,16,(screams):,"No!
"
8,16,17,(quietly):,"This is exhilarating.
"
8,16,18,Narrator:,"And there were.
"
8,16,19,(whispers):,"Robin.

8,16,22,(whispers):,"Lily! Lily!
"
8,17,1,Narrator:,"Kids, you remember the Captain.
"
8,17,2,Marshall:,"He sounds pissed.
"
8,17,3,(chuckling):,"Oh, boy, yeah.
"
8,17,4,Ted:,"You weren't there.
"
8,17,5,Ted:,"Man, this guy's so rude.
"
8,17,6,BECKY:,"Boats, boats, boats!

8,17,7,Robin:,"And the Captain wasn't glaring at you.

"
8,3,4,Marshall:,"Are you sure this poo-poo didn't happen on your watch and you just ran out the clock until it was my problem?
"
8,3,5,(chuckles):,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.
"
8,3,6,Lily:,"I can't believe I have to go back to work on Monday and we still haven't found a nanny.
"
8,3,7,(chuckles):,"Are you kidding?
"
8,3,8,Narrator:,"Kids, when you're in a new relationship and you're competing with your ex for who's happier, it can get ugly.

"
8,3,13,(Boston accent):,"You're better than this, Barney!

8,3,14,(deep voice):,"Well, the evidence is pretty incriminating, but...
"
8,3,15,(normal voice):,"Damn it! What?
"
8,3,16,Narrator:,"But Lily and Marshall needed a nanny, so they forged ahead with their search.
"
8,3,17,(coughs):,"I'm available.

8,3,19,(coughs):,"I wasn't talking to you.

"
8,3,22,Narrator:,"That night, Lily and Marshall called Julie hoping she'd accept the job.

8,3,23,Both:,"Barney!
"
8,3,24,"Barney, quick question:","why are you interviewing nannies?
"
8,3,25,Barney:,"And there it was.
"
8,3,26,(whispering):,"but one, he's napping, and two, he doesn't exist.
"
8,3,27,"And in the end, the coroner's report confirmed what I already feared:","the female body cannot withstand that many consecutive orgasms.

8,3,30,5:,"0.
"
8,3,31,Mickey:,"Well, when I came back this morning from my jog, Marshall was gone, and I couldn't find Mrs. What's-her-face.
"
8,3,32,Lily:,"Then, why did I wake up
"
8,3,33,How am I gonna make it to 3:,"0 without her?
"
8,3,34,(Boston accent):,"Ten parking tickets, huh?
"
8,3,35,(normal voice):,"Why did I ever doubt a classic?

8,3,36,MRS. BUCKMINSTER:,"Now, now, now.
"
8,7,1,Here's what you do:,"hit a few strip clubs in Jersey and Long Island.

8,7,3,All:,"No!
"
8,7,4,Lily:,"Hey, you guys should check out that song by the band Dishwalla.
"
8,7,5,Ted:,"Really? I've never heard of them.
"
8,7,6,"Bottom line, Vito:","a lot of strip clubs are into my client.

8,7,7,One question:,"Golden Oldies just sent me a fax machine and a Charo calendar.

8,7,8,Ted:,"What is Generation X?
"
8,7,9,Lily:,"Ted, that beret looks stupid.
"
8,7,10,TED (French accent):,"I look magnifique !
"
8,7,11,(high-pitched):,"I don't remember that!
"
8,7,12,Now let's go. It is 4:,"0, and their dinner show starts in ten minutes.

8,7,13,(on video):,"Do it, do it, do it, do it.
"
8,7,14,Ted:,"Don't think, Mosby! Do it now! Oh, my God, I'm doing it!
"
8,7,15,Lily:,"And then you build to something else small, like a tasty snack.

8,7,16,Lily:,"And when Honeywell starts trusting your stamp again, he'll seek out your opinion on things.

8,7,21,Narrator:,"The next day, Uncle Marshall went to court for the biggest case of his life.
"
8,7,22,Narrator:,"And so began the trial that would change the course of Marshall's career.
"
8,7,23,"Oh, you see?! This is what I miss about being single:","cutting loose at a strip club, drinkin' some beers, seein' some boobs, getting thrown out for being ""too handsy.""
"
8,13,1,Narrator:,"Kids, in late 2012, I received a very important text message. Uncle Barney and Aunt Robin were engaged, marking a truly happy time for our little group. The problem was one of us was definitely not happy.
"
8,13,2,Marshall:,"Food going in isn't the problem, it's what's coming out, or not coming out.
"
8,13,3,Lily:,"Yeah, normally I wouldn't wish one of his dirty diapers on my worst enemy, but now I kind of miss popping the hood in the morning and finding that first big juicy, black...
"
8,13,4,Marshall:,"I have a feeling at this point, Rip Taylor is Rip Taylor in a diaper.
"
8,13,5,Marshall:,"Hey, Robin, where's Barney?
"
8,13,6,ROBIN (quietly):,"Oh, my God.
"
8,13,7,Barney:,"Lily, do you remember the band you guys almost hired for your wedding?
"
8,13,8,Marshall:,"He said no?
"
8,13,9,Narrator:,"The next day, Uncle Barney met Robin's dad for lunch at the same restaurant.
"
8,13,10,Man:,"Would either of you like a mudslide?
"
8,13,11,Robin:,"Ugh! God, this is, like, the fifteenth time my dad has sent me a friend request.
"
8,13,12,Begged my mom to burn those. TED:,"Robin, trust me, no good can come from accepting that friend request.
"
8,13,13,"Since you obviously have no interest in involving me in your personal life, I may as well tell you:","Barney and I are already engaged.
"
8,13,14,"Sure, bands seem cool with their nice suits and their well-rehearsed moves, but let's be honest:","bands let you down.
"
8,13,15,But I just need to know:,"(Boston accent): Are you a cop? I'm not a cop!
"
8,13,16,Narrator:,"Kids, at that point in my life,
"
8,13,17,Narrator:,"But when I saw that text message, and found out Robin was engaged, it was like:
"
8,13,18,Narrator:,"And, no, it wasn't confetti.
"
8,13,19,Narrator:,"That night, Robin agreed
"
8,13,20,Narrator:,"I made a pretty strong case that night, but in the end, she didn't want a DJ.
"
8,13,21,Narrator:,"And, kids, ""lucky"" doesn't even begin to describe it.
"
8,13,22,Narrator:,"Because if Barney and Robin had taken my stupid advice and hired a DJ... I never would have met your mother.
"
8,12,1,Both:,"Scotch, neat.
"
8,12,2,Narrator:,"Kids, you may be wondering why five adults in their 30s would take a jinx so seriously. It all started one day five years ago.
"
8,12,3,Narrator:,"Barney broke three limbs and two vertebrae, but he never broke another jinx.
"
8,12,4,(over phone):,"Hello, this is Frank.
"
8,12,5,Narrator:,"So, when someone finally jinxed Barney for the first time in years, we were pretty psyched.
"
8,12,6,Lily:,"Oh, oh, oh, you want us to say your name and un-jinx you?
"
8,12,7,Oh! ROBIN:,"Now, Ted, I was wondering if you could expand upon what you were saying earlier about antiquated currency.
"
8,12,8,Narrator:,"In the winter of 2012 the skyscraper that I designed was about to open, which got me thinking about the most influential architecture professor I ever had.

8,12,9,(laughing):,"You'll never be an architect!

8,12,10,Robin:,"Wow.
"
8,12,11,Narrator:,"When Robin's most hated coworker Patrice started dating Barney, she became obsessed.

8,12,15,(distorted):,"No!

"
8,12,29,Narrator:,"Kids, sometimes in life you'll make a pit for someone in your mind.
"
8,12,30,Narrator:,"Which means there's only one person who can let you out of the pit.
"
8,12,31,Both:,"Are you serious?
"
8,12,32,I'll unjinx you if you'll follow these two rules:,"one: you can't try to talk me out of it, and two: you can't tell anybody. Agreed?

8,12,33,All:,"Aw, come on, Ted!
"
8,12,34,Narrator:,"So I had promised not to tell anyone about Barney's plan to propose to Patrice.

8,12,36,2:,"2 p.m.-- guilt Ted into saying it's okay if we leave early tonight.

8,12,62,All:,"To Ted.
"
8,6,1,Narrator:,"In the fall of 2012, Nick and Robin were going strong. Sometimes it's hard to say what it is exactly that makes a couple click.

8,10,6,So he overcorrects by dating her opposite:,"warm and nurturing Patrice.
"
8,10,7,Lily:,"That does happen, like Ted.
"
8,10,8,Lily:,"You suck!
"
8,10,9,Mickey:,"Hey, Lil, let me know how the pump's working.

8,4,12,Marshall:,"Yeah, you see, guys, we were really struggling with this decision.
"
8,4,13,"Babe, I know these guys have been a little over the top lately. LILY:","A little?
