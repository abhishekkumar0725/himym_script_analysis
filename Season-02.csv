2,20,1,Ted (2030):,"When the marriage approched, some weird stuff started happening.
"
2,20,2,Lily:,"Why does my stomach hurt?
"
2,20,3,Marshall:,"I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.
"
2,20,4,Lily:,"Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant.
"
2,20,5,Tes:,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.
"
2,20,6,Lily:,"No, we're not.
"
2,20,7,Ted:,"Oh, really? What about the other day?
"
2,20,8,Lily:,"Oh, I need to get some eggs.
"
2,20,9,Marshall:,"Oh, I'll come with you.
"
2,20,10,Marshall:,"Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.
"
2,20,11,Barney:,"Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?
"
2,20,12,Marshall:,"Okay, we decided not to do that because of...
"
2,20,13,Lily:,"Logistics. Wedding logistics.
"
2,20,14,Marshall:,"Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up.
"
2,20,15,Ted:,"You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.
"
2,20,16,Marshall:,"Sure we could.
"
2,20,17,Robin:,"Then why don't you? You can stay with me.
"
2,20,18,Lily:,"It would make our wedding night more special.
"
2,20,19,Marshall:,"Okay, let's do it.
"
2,20,20,Lily:,"Done.
"
2,20,21,Marshall:,"I'm gonna go grab a beer.
"
2,20,22,Lily:,"I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.
"
2,20,23,Lily:,"Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra....
"
2,20,24,Ted:,"Long story. I'll tell you later.
"
2,20,25,Barney:,"Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.
"
2,20,26,Robin:,"Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons.
"
2,20,27,Marshall:,"Oh, you didn't. That's right.
"
2,20,28,Barney:,"So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?
"
2,20,29,Marshall:,"You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be.
"
2,20,30,Lily:,"Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.
"
2,20,31,Barney:,"Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her?
"
2,20,32,Marshall:,"No.
"
2,20,33,Lily:,"He doesn't say it. He sings it.
"
2,20,34,Barney:,"Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.
"
2,20,35,Lily:,"Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.
"
2,20,36,Barney:,"What's on there?
"
2,20,37,Lily:,"Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...
"
2,20,38,Barney:,"Retail price $319.99. What else?
"
2,20,39,Lily:,"Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.
"
2,20,40,Barney:,"Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?
"
2,20,41,Marshall:,"Did you memorize our registry?
"
2,20,42,Barney:,"No, I'm training.
"
2,20,43,Marshall:,"Training? For what?
"
2,20,44,Barney:,"I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?
"
2,20,45,Ted:,"Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.
"
2,20,46,Barney:,"Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right.
"
2,20,47,Marshall:,"No way!
"
2,20,48,Ted:,"What?!
"
2,20,49,Barney:,"Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.
"
2,20,50,Marshall:,"Whoa, that is so awesome.
"
2,20,51,Robin:,"Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.
"
2,20,52,Barney:,"Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.
"
2,20,53,Ted (2030):,"Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.
"
2,20,54,Lily:,"I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.)
"
2,20,55,Robin:,"Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.
"
2,20,56,Lily:,"I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess! (she raises her arms and the dress falls.) I'm too skinny for my dress!
"
2,20,57,Ted(2030):,"Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall.
"
2,20,58,Ted:,"Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?
"
2,20,59,Marshall:,"That's fantastic.
"
2,20,60,Ted:,"When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.
"
2,20,61,Marshall:,"Oh, crap.
"
2,20,62,Lily:,"Oh, crap.
"
2,20,63,Marshall:,"Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.
"
2,20,64,Ted:,"That grandpa died three years ago.
"
2,20,65,Marshall:,"His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.
"
2,20,66,Barney:,"So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?
"
2,20,67,Marshall:,"What was that?
"
2,20,68,Barney:,"I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!""
"
2,20,69,Ted:,"Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?
"
2,20,70,Barney:,"Yeah, of course.
"
2,20,71,Barney:,"Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.
"
2,20,72,Lily:,"It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?
"
2,20,73,Robin:,"What happened?
"
2,20,74,Lily:,"She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.
"
2,20,75,Robin:,"Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?
"
2,20,76,Lily:,"Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate souffl√©e with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.
"
2,20,77,Robin:,"I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.
"
2,20,78,Lily:,"Done!
"
2,20,79,Ted:,"Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.
"
2,20,80,Marshall:,"I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,
"
2,20,81,Ted:,"I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.
"
2,20,82,Marshall:,"Nice.
"
2,20,83,Ted:,"Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...
"
2,20,84,Marshall:,"I love you.
"
2,20,85,Lily:,"I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.
"
2,20,86,Marshall:,"Yeah. Ted leaves the room.
"
2,20,87,Marshall:,"So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family: drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food.
"
2,20,88,Ted:,"Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?
"
2,20,89,Marshall:,"Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns
"
2,20,90,Ted:,"But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.
"
2,20,91,Marshall:,"Hey, Lil.
"
2,20,92,Lily:,"Hey.
"
2,20,93,Ted:,"Hey? That's it?
"
2,20,94,Marshall:,"What are you talking about?
"
2,20,95,Ted:,"Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do
"
2,20,96,Ted (2030):,"Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.
"
2,20,97,Barney:,"Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? (he turnst he wheel)
"
2,20,98,Marshall:,"Oh, wow, that was pretty close.
"
2,20,99,Barney:,"Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!
"
2,20,100,Ted:,"What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?
"
2,20,101,Barney:,"Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.
"
2,20,102,Ted:,"Your father?
"
2,20,103,Barney:,"That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.
"
2,20,104,Ted:,"Your dad... is Bob Barker?
"
2,20,105,Barney:,"That's right
"
2,20,106,Lily:,"The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?
"
2,20,107,Barney:,"That's Pops.
"
2,20,108,Robin:,"Barney?
"
2,20,109,Bareney:,"Yes, Robin?
"
2,20,110,Robin:,"Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?
"
2,20,111,Barney:,"Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.
"
2,20,112,Barney:,"Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?
"
2,20,113,Barney's mom:,"Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)
"
2,20,114,Barney(in front oft he tv):,"ook, Dad, I got straight A's!
"
2,20,115,Bareny (dressed as Bob Barker):,"Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?
"
2,20,116,Barney (throwing a ball at the TV):,"Want to play some catch, Pop?
"
2,20,117,Barney:,"So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.
"
2,20,118,Ted:,"You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?
"
2,20,119,Barney:,"Why is this so hard for you people to believe?
"
2,20,120,Robin:,"Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.
"
2,20,121,Lily:,"This is the best wedding diet ever.
"
2,20,122,Lily:,"I lost a pound.
"
2,20,123,Robin:,"That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.
"
2,20,124,Lily:,"I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.
"
2,20,125,Robin:,"Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!
"
2,20,126,Lily:,"I can't.
"
2,20,127,Robin:,"Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.
"
2,20,128,Lily:,"I'm trying.
"
2,20,129,Robin:,"Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!
"
2,20,130,Lily:,"Okay!
"
2,20,131,Ted:,"Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.
"
2,20,132,Marshall:,"Finally.
"
2,20,133,Ted:,"Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.
"
2,20,134,Marshall:,"Still strong, right?
"
2,20,135,Ted:,"Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall
"
2,20,136,Ted:,"when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk.
"
2,20,137,Ted (last year):,"Man, I'm well nourished right now!
"
2,20,138,Barney:,"Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.
"
2,20,139,Robin:,"Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.
"
2,20,140,Marshall:,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.
"
2,20,141,Ted:,"Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.
"
2,20,142,Marshall:,"You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.
"
2,20,143,Lily:,"Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?
"
2,20,144,Ted:,"Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.
"
2,20,145,Marshall:,"That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.
"
2,20,146,Ted:,"Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.
"
2,20,147,Lily:,"I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.
"
2,20,148,Marshall:,"I know.
"
2,20,149,Ted:,"And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.
"
2,20,150,Ted:,"Marshall, what are you doing?
"
2,20,151,Marshall:,"Going to the bathroom.
"
2,20,152,Ted:,"In the hall?
"
2,20,153,Marshall:,"Sleepwalking?
"
2,20,154,Ted:,"You're wide awake.
"
2,20,155,Marshall:,"Robbing us?
"
2,20,156,Ted:,"Dude.
"
2,20,157,Ted (giving the toast):,"Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily.
"
2,20,158,Lily:,"God, I missed you.
"
2,20,159,Marshall:,"I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?
"
2,20,160,Lily:,"Sure, baby.
"
2,20,161,Marshall:,"How's the weight gaining going?
"
2,20,162,Lily:,"Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around.
"
2,20,163,Marshall:,"Well, I'm here now.
"
2,20,164,Ted(giving the toast):,"And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall.
"
2,20,165,All:,"To Lily and Marshall.
"
2,20,166,Ted (2030):,"Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney.
"
2,20,167,Bob:,"Rich, what is the name of our next participant?
"
2,20,168,Rich:,"Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.
"
2,20,169,Barney:,"Nooo. Oh, my God!
"
2,20,170,Bob:,"Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here.
"
2,20,171,"At the apartment, all:","Oh, my God!
"
2,20,172,"At the apartment, Barney:","Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.
"
2,20,173,Bob:,"Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.
"
2,20,174,Barney:,"Thanks, Da... Bob.
"
2,20,175,Bob:,"Here is the next item up for bid!
"
2,20,176,Rich:,"Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches feature an 18k gold bezel and crown and stainless steel bands.
"
2,20,177,Bob:,"And Barney, what do you bid on that?
"
2,20,178,Barney:,"Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.
"
2,20,179,Bob:,"$1,350 for Barney.
"
2,20,180,"At the apartment, Lily:","So, was it $1,350?
"
2,20,181,"At the apartment, Barney:","I don't know. Was it?
"
2,20,182,"At the apartment, Barney:","Happy wedding.
"
2,20,183,Bob:,"Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.
"
2,20,184,Barney:,"Thank you, Bob.
"
2,20,185,Bob:,"Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.
"
2,20,186,Barney:,"$1 billion.
"
2,20,187,Bob:,"Lower.
"
2,20,188,Barney:,"So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.
"
2,20,189,Bob:,"Yes, Barney. This is...
"
2,20,190,"At the apartment, Ted:","What are you doing?
"
2,20,191,"At the apartment, Barney:","Uh, spending some quality time with my dad.
"
2,20,192,Bob:,"That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.
"
2,20,193,Barney:,"No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.
"
2,20,194,Bob:,"Keep bidding.
"
2,20,195,Bob:,"That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...
"
2,20,196,Barney:,"$999.
"
2,20,197,Bob:,"Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!
"
2,20,198,"At the apartment, Barney:","Happy wedding again!
"
2,20,199,"At the apartement, Lily:","Oh, my...
"
2,20,200,Barney:,"I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game.
"
2,20,201,Bob:,"I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.
"
2,20,202,Barney:,"Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.
"
2,20,203,Bob:,"Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around...
"
2,20,204,"At the apartment, Ted:","Oh, no, you spun it too hard.
"
2,20,205,"At the apartment, Robin:","No, he didn't spin it hard enough.
"
2,20,206,Bob:,"Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.
"
2,20,207,Barney:,"Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?
"
2,20,208,Bob:,"Sure.
"
2,20,209,"At the apartment, Ted:","That was kind of a weird moment.
"
2,20,210,Bob:,"Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?
"
2,20,211,Barney:,"Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass.
"
2,20,212,Bob:,"Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?
"
2,20,213,Millie:,"$17,640.
"
2,20,214,Bob:,"$17,640.
"
2,20,215,Barney:,"Overbid!
"
2,20,216,Bob:,"Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.
"
2,20,217,Barney:,"Oh, I love this.
"
2,20,218,"At the apartment, Robin:","I can't believe how excited I am right now
"
2,20,219,Bob:,"Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?
"
2,20,220,Barney:,"Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1.
"
2,20,221,"At the apartment, Marshall:","I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it!
"
2,20,222,Bob:,"And the actual retail price of your showcase is...
"
2,20,223,Barney:,"$14,628.
"
2,20,224,Bob:,"$14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...
"
2,20,225,Barney:,"Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.
"
2,20,226,Bob:,"Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...
"
2,20,227,Barney:,"Have your pets spayed or neutered.
"
2,20,228,Ted:,"Why didn't you tell him?
"
2,20,229,Barney:,"Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.
"
2,20,230,Ted:,"Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.
"
2,20,231,Barney:,"Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!
"
2,20,232,Ted (2030):,"And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.
"
2,20,233,Marshall:,"Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted.
"
2,20,234,Ted:,"No, it's weird.
"
2,20,235,Marshall:,"You promised.
"
2,20,236,Ted:,"Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
"
2,8,1,Ted from 2030:,"And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together.
"
2,8,2,Lily:,"Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!
"
2,8,3,Marshall:,"Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.
"
2,8,4,Lily:,"Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?
"
2,8,5,Marshall:,"Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?
"
2,8,6,Ted from 2030:,"And things were back to normal... Almost.
"
2,8,7,Lily:,"You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.
"
2,8,8,Marshall:,"Oh, uhm...
"
2,8,9,Lily:,"I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?
"
2,8,10,Marshall:,"Really?
"
2,8,11,Lily:,"Of course, I love you.
"
2,8,12,Marshall:,"No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? ""Do you still wanna?"" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.
"
2,8,13,Lily (getting down on one knee):,"Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...
"
2,8,14,Marshall:,"No, no, no, no, no, no.
"
2,8,15,Lily:,"What?!
"
2,8,16,Marshall:,"You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.
"
2,8,17,Lily:,"Do you remember your proposal to me? (She puts her hand on her eye)
"
2,8,18,Marshall:,"I had a speech prepared.
"
2,8,19,Lily:,"What do you want to hear?
"
2,8,20,Marshall:,"I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.
"
2,8,21,Lily:,"Marshall... You are good-looking...
"
2,8,22,Marshall:,"Thank you.
"
2,8,23,Lily:,"Funny...
"
2,8,24,Marshall:,"Oh, thanks.
"
2,8,25,Lily:,"Smart...
"
2,8,26,Marshall:,"And a few tears wouldn't hurt.
"
2,8,27,Lily:,"Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?
"
2,8,28,Marshall:,"I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.
"
2,8,29,Lily:,"Yeah, right. (They kiss)
"
2,8,30,Marshall:,"I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.
"
2,8,31,Lily:,"I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!
"
2,8,32,Marshall:,"I know, I know.
"
2,8,33,Ted from 2030:,"It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family.
"
2,8,34,[FLASHBACK]Marshall (on the phone):,"Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off. What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that? What do you call that? I think that that's a little strong. I can't even believe you would use a word like that. Geez, Grandma.
"
2,8,35,Lily:,"Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?
"
2,8,36,Marshall:,"It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?
"
2,8,37,Lily:,"God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.
"
2,8,38,Marshall:,"Yeah...
"
2,8,39,Robin:,"Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.
"
2,8,40,Marshall:,"Robin! Stop the news!
"
2,8,41,Woman:,"What the hell?
"
2,8,42,Robin:,"It's okay. They're my friends.
"
2,8,43,Lily:,"We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.
"
2,8,44,Robin:,"Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work.
"
2,8,45,Woman:,"It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight. (To the cameraman) Hey, Mike... You can read, right?
"
2,8,46,Mike:,"Yeah, I'm the best at reading.
"
2,8,47,Robin:,"Let's go to Atlantic City!
"
2,8,48,All:,"Yeah!
"
2,8,49,Ted:,"You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?
"
2,8,50,Lily:,"I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.
"
2,8,51,Ted:,"Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.
"
2,8,52,Lily:,"Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?
"
2,8,53,Ted:,"Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!
"
2,8,54,Marshall:,"Yeah!
"
2,8,55,Ted:,"Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?
"
2,8,56,Marshall:,"You got it.
"
2,8,57,Barney:,"Hey, guys.
"
2,8,58,Ted:,"Wow. A pedicure.
"
2,8,59,Barney:,"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.
"
2,8,60,Lily:,"We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!
"
2,8,61,Barney:,"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?
"
2,8,62,Marshall:,"So are you in or not?
"
2,8,63,Barney:,"Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.
"
2,8,64,Marshall:,"No, we got to get going to the...
"
2,8,65,Lily:,"Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...
"
2,8,66,Ted from 2030:,"So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City.
"
2,8,67,Lily:,"Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.
"
2,8,68,Marshall:,"And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.
"
2,8,69,Barney:,"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.
"
2,8,70,Ted:,"You been here before?
"
2,8,71,Barney:,"Oh, uh, once or twice.
"
2,8,72,Chinese 1:,"Barney!
"
2,8,73,Barney:,"Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.
"
2,8,74,Lily:,"The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?
"
2,8,75,Marshall:,"I'm ready. Let's get married.
"
2,8,76,"Barney, Ted and Robin:","Yeah.
"
2,8,77,Lily:,"Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.
"
2,8,78,Robin:,"Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.
"
2,8,79,Lily:,"Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.
"
2,8,80,Robin:,"Oh, really? Thanks.
"
2,8,81,Lily:,"Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.
"
2,8,82,Robin:,"Done. (She leaves)
"
2,8,83,Lily:,"I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. (She leaves)
"
2,8,84,Ted:,"You guys want to go gamble?
"
2,8,85,Marshall:,"No, we got to go get the veil.
"
2,8,86,Ted:,"Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.
"
2,8,87,Marshall:,"Yeah, okay.
"
2,8,88,Barney:,"No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. (He leaves)
"
2,8,89,Ted:,"So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.
"
2,8,90,Marshall:,"Thanks.
"
2,8,91,Ted:,"How are you feeling?
"
2,8,92,Marshall:,"Great, a little nervous.
"
2,8,93,Ted:,"Yeah? Craps?
"
2,8,94,Marshall:,"Not that nervous.
"
2,8,95,Ted:,"No, I mean do you want to play craps.
"
2,8,96,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah, definitely.
"
2,8,97,Barney:,"Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?
"
2,8,98,Ted:,"What did you just say?
"
2,8,99,Marshall:,"Barney, no.
"
2,8,100,Barney:,"Marshall, I'm your best man.
"
2,8,101,Marshall:,"You're not my best man.
"
2,8,102,Ted:,"Right here.
"
2,8,103,Barney:,"And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.
"
2,8,104,Marshall:,"You're not my best friend.
"
2,8,105,Ted:,"Right here.
"
2,8,106,Marshall:,"Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.
"
2,8,107,Ted:,"18 minutes...
"
2,8,108,Lily:,"Oh, good. Did you get the veil?
"
2,8,109,Barney:,"Of course.
"
2,8,110,Marshall:,"And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.
"
2,8,111,Ted:,"Dude!
"
2,8,112,Barney:,"Unbelievable!
"
2,8,113,Marshall:,"We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.
"
2,8,114,Lily:,"Your last lap dance ever.
"
2,8,115,Marshall:,"Right. What?
"
2,8,116,"Robin (arriving, wearing a ""shirt boobs""):","Okay, I'm here. Right?
"
2,8,117,Ted:,"Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.
"
2,8,118,Robin:,"Does it smell like strippers in here?
"
2,8,119,Ted:,"That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!
"
2,8,120,Lily:,"Hell, yeah, look at this. (She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)
"
2,8,121,Marshall:,"Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.
"
2,8,122,Lily:,"Hi. We're here to get married.
"
2,8,123,Woman:,"Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.
"
2,8,124,Marshall:,"We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.
"
2,8,125,Woman:,"Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?
"
2,8,126,Robin:,"Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.
"
2,8,127,Ted (looking at Robin's shirt):,"What?
"
2,8,128,Woman:,"It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.
"
2,8,129,Lily:,"No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.
"
2,8,130,Woman:,"Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.
"
2,8,131,Ted:,"Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.
"
2,8,132,Woman:,"Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.
"
2,8,133,Lily:,"Have you been outside?
"
2,8,134,Ted:,"There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.
"
2,8,135,Marshall:,"You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?
"
2,8,136,Woman:,"About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
"
2,8,137,Barney:,"Bright side: the bachelor party continues!
"
2,8,138,Ted:,"Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club.
"
2,8,139,Woman:,"Twenty-seven.
"
2,8,140,Lily:,"Is there any way that we could get a license today?
"
2,8,141,Woman:,"You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.
"
2,8,142,Lily:,"Well, we're in love.
"
2,8,143,Marshall:,"What better reason could there be?
"
2,8,144,Woman:,"The last one I heard was, ""I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"" but, you know, give yours a whirl.
"
2,8,145,Ted from 2030:,"So we went to the courthouse.
"
2,8,146,Marshall:,"God, this is taking forever.
"
2,8,147,Robin (to Ted):,"Can't believe they're getting married.
"
2,8,148,Ted:,"I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...
"
2,8,149,Robin:,"Ted, up here.
"
2,8,150,Ted:,"Uhm?
"
2,8,151,Robin:,"You were just staring at my shirt boobs.
"
2,8,152,Ted:,"No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.
"
2,8,153,Chinese 2:,"Hey, it's Barney! Barney!
"
2,8,154,Barney:,"Hi.
"
2,8,155,Chinese 2:,"(speaks Chinese language)...suit up! (both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!
"
2,8,156,Barney:,"See you.
"
2,8,157,Ted:,"What the hell was that?
"
2,8,158,Barney:,"A... Chinese guy?
"
2,8,159,Marshall:,"Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.
"
2,8,160,Woman 2:,"Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.
"
2,8,161,Lily:,"Oh, really?!
"
2,8,162,Woman 2:,"Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.
"
2,8,163,Lily:,"Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?
"
2,8,164,Woman 2:,"Absolutely.
"
2,8,165,Lily:,"Really?!
"
2,8,166,Woman 2:,"Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.
"
2,8,167,Marshall:,"Why are you doing this to us?!
"
2,8,168,Woman 2:,"'Cause you're on Candid Camera!
"
2,8,169,Robin:,"Really?!
"
2,8,170,Woman 2:,"Is what I would say...
"
2,8,171,Marshall:,"You know what? We get it.
"
2,8,172,Lily:,"Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.
"
2,8,173,Marshall:,"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.
"
2,8,174,Barney:,"Vultures.
"
2,8,175,Ted (to Robin):,"Psst. (They move away)
"
2,8,176,Robin:,"What? Here?
"
2,8,177,Ted:,"Yeah. Got a little time to kill.
"
2,8,178,Robin:,"Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?
"
2,8,179,Ted:,"No. A little.
"
2,8,180,Robin:,"Something is seriously wrong with you.
"
2,8,181,Ted:,"So what, is that a no?
"
2,8,182,Robin:,"All right, let's do it.
"
2,8,183,Ted:,"All right. Um, also...?
"
2,8,184,Robin:,"Yes, I'll leave it on.
"
2,8,185,Ted:,"Sweet.
"
2,8,186,Barney:,"Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.
"
2,8,187,Lily:,"Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.
"
2,8,188,Barney:,"You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.
"
2,8,189,Lily:,"Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!
"
2,8,190,Judge:,"Turn it off.
"
2,8,191,Lily:,"Okay. May we please get married today?
"
2,8,192,Judge:,"Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?
"
2,8,193,Lily:,"What was what?
"
2,8,194,Judge:,"That little look. What was that?
"
2,8,195,Marshall:,"A look of love.
"
2,8,196,Judge:,"You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?
"
2,8,197,Marshall:,"You know, what's thick? what's thin?
"
2,8,198,Lily:,"Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.
"
2,8,199,Marshall:,"I have.
"
2,8,200,Judge:,"All right, what was that look? What's going on?
"
2,8,201,Barney:,"They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.
"
2,8,202,Ted:,"No, we're not.
"
2,8,203,Barney:,"Yeah, we are. He's a judge.
"
2,8,204,Ted:,"Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?
"
2,8,205,Barney:,"Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.
"
2,8,206,Marshall:,"Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.
"
2,8,207,Lily:,"No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.
"
2,8,208,Marshall:,"Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.
"
2,8,209,Lily:,"Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.
"
2,8,210,Ted:,"Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?
"
2,8,211,Lily:,"This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?
"
2,8,212,Woman:,"This is my machine.
"
2,8,213,Marshall:,"I should go talk to her.
"
2,8,214,Robin:,"No, let me.
"
2,8,215,Ted:,"Blackjack?
"
2,8,216,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
2,8,217,Lily:,"Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.
"
2,8,218,Robin:,"Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?
"
2,8,219,Lily:,"Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.
"
2,8,220,Robin:,"Nobody's gonna do that.
"
2,8,221,Lily:,"No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.
"
2,8,222,Robin:,"Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...
"
2,8,223,Marshall:,"Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.
"
2,8,224,Lily:,"What?
"
2,8,225,Ted:,"Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?
"
2,8,226,Lily:,"See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?
"
2,8,227,Captain:,"I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.
"
2,8,228,Marshall:,"What?
"
2,8,229,Lily:,"Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.
"
2,8,230,Barney:,"I can get us that money.
"
2,8,231,Ted:,"How?
"
2,8,232,Barney:,"Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?
"
2,8,233,Ted:,"Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?
"
2,8,234,Barney:,"Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.
"
2,8,235,Robin:,"No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.
"
2,8,236,Barney:,"Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.
"
2,8,237,Ted from 2030:,"Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did.
"
2,8,238,Lily:,"Do you understand what's happening?
"
2,8,239,Ted:,"Not a clue.
"
2,8,240,Robin:,"Do you think he's winning?
"
2,8,241,Ted:,"I don't even know if he's playing.
"
2,8,242,Marshall:,"Wait, I get it. I understand this game.
"
2,8,243,Ted:,"No, you don't.
"
2,8,244,Marshall:,"I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.
"
2,8,245,Barney:,"Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.
"
2,8,246,Lily:,"Wow. It's beautiful.
"
2,8,247,Marshall:,"Thanks, Barney.
"
2,8,248,Barney:,"Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!
"
2,8,249,Ted:,"When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?
"
2,8,250,Barney:,"Why can't I do it just a little?
"
2,8,251,Lily:,"Okay. Let's get this started.
"
2,8,252,Captain:,"Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?
"
2,8,253,Captain:,"You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.
"
2,8,254,Marshall:,"Yeah, serious is probably good.
"
2,8,255,Captain:,"""We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...""
"
2,8,256,Ted:,"This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.
"
2,8,257,Robin:,"I never said ""never.""
"
2,8,258,Captain:,"""...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you."" What was that?
"
2,8,259,Marshall:,"What was what?
"
2,8,260,Captain:,"That little look. You two just shared a look.
"
2,8,261,Lily:,"We don't want to do this.
"
2,8,262,Marshall:,"We don't.
"
2,8,263,Ted:,"Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?
"
2,8,264,Robin:,"After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?
"
2,8,265,Barney:,"Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?
"
2,8,266,Ted:,"You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?
"
2,8,267,Lily:,"Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.
"
2,8,268,Marshall:,"So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.
"
2,8,269,Lily:,"I love you, Marshmallow.
"
2,8,270,Marshall:,"I love you, too, Lilypad.
"
2,8,271,Captain:,"I now pronounce you man and wife.
"
2,8,272,Lily:,"What?!
"
2,8,273,Captain:,"Is that not right?
"
2,8,274,Marshall:,"Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.
"
2,8,275,Captain:,"Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.
"
2,8,276,Both Marshall and Lily:,"Unpronounce us! Unpronounce us!
"
2,8,277,Captain:,"All right, I unpronounce you man and wife.
"
2,8,278,Lily:,"Oh, whew... That was close.
"
2,8,279,Ted from 2030:,"And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily got married for 12 seconds somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City.
"
2,8,280,Ted (wearing Robin's shirt boobs):,"Hey, guys.
"
2,8,281,Marshall:,"Hey... Ted.
"
2,8,282,Lily:,"Is Robin here?
"
2,8,283,Marshall:,"Man, I hope so.
"
2,9,1,Future Ted VO:,"..learn about relationships is that you're never done getting to know someone.
"
2,9,2,Ted:,"You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.
"
2,9,3,Future Ted VO:,"Some aren't as nice.
"
2,9,4,Robin:,"And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...
"
2,9,5,Ted:,"Oh, I got your total...counting along...
"
2,9,6,Future Ted VO:,"And some are just weird.
"
2,9,7,Ted:,"You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?
"
2,9,8,Robin:,"Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?
"
2,9,9,Barney:,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.
"
2,9,10,Robin:,"Why?
"
2,9,11,Barney:,"Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?
"
2,9,12,Robin:,"No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.
"
2,9,13,Barney:,"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.
"
2,9,14,Barney:,"Come on, let's go.
"
2,9,15,Robin:,"All right, I'm in.
"
2,9,16,Barney:,"To the Willowbrook Mall!
"
2,9,17,"Ted, Marshall:","To the Willowbrook Mall!
"
2,9,18,Robin:,"Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.
"
2,9,19,Ted:,"What? Why not?
"
2,9,20,Robin:,"I just don't feel like going to a mall.
"
2,9,21,Lily:,"We can split a cinnabun.
"
2,9,22,Robin:,"No, I'm really not gonna go.
"
2,9,23,Ted:,"Come on, it'll be fun.
"
2,9,24,Robin:,"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.
"
2,9,25,Barney:,"Why not?
"
2,9,26,Robin:,"I'd rather not say.
"
2,9,27,Ted:,"Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.
"
2,9,28,Robin:,"Thanks Ted.
"
2,9,29,Ted:,"So, what's the deal with you and malls?
"
2,9,30,Robin:,"You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.
"
2,9,31,Ted:,"Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?
"
2,9,32,Robin:,"No.
"
2,9,33,Ted:,"Dumped in a mall?
"
2,9,34,Robin:,"Ted.
"
2,9,35,Ted:,"Found out you were Canadian at a mall?
"
2,9,36,Robin:,"Let it go.
"
2,9,37,Ted:,"Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.
"
2,9,38,Ted:,"Mauled at the mall?
"
2,9,39,Robin:,"Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.
"
2,9,40,Ted:,"What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?
"
2,9,41,Barney:,"Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.
"
2,9,42,Marshall:,"The 'oh' moment?
"
2,9,43,Barney:,"Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.
"
2,9,44,Girl #1:,"It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.
"
2,9,45,Barney:,"Oh.
"
2,9,46,Girl #2:,"I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.
"
2,9,47,Barney:,"Oh.
"
2,9,48,Girl #3:,"I just turned 30.
"
2,9,49,Barney:,"Oh.
"
2,9,50,Barney:,"So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.
"
2,9,51,Ted:,"I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?
"
2,9,52,Priest:,"I now pronounce you man and wife.
"
2,9,53,Ted:,"I love you.
"
2,9,54,Robin:,"I used to be a dude.
"
2,9,55,Lily:,"Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.
"
2,9,56,Barney:,"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.
"
2,9,57,Ted:,"It's true. They tell each other everything.
"
2,9,58,Barney:,"I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you
"
2,9,59,Lily:,"Try me.
"
2,9,60,Barney:,"Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?
"
2,9,61,Lily:,"Doggie ate his pants. Yep.
"
2,9,62,Barney:,"Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.
"
2,9,63,Lily:,"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?
"
2,9,64,Barney:,"OK, Seattle.
"
2,9,65,Lily:,"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.
"
2,9,66,Barney:,"Damn.
"
2,9,67,Marshall:,"I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.
"
2,9,68,Ted:,"Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.
"
2,9,69,Marshall:,"So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.
"
2,9,70,Lily:,"What happened next?
"
2,9,71,(back to present scene) Ted:,"Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.
"
2,9,72,Barney:,"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?
"
2,9,73,Ted:,"You know?
"
2,9,74,Barney:,"Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p0rn, wait for it, ography.
"
2,9,75,Ted:,"Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.
"
2,9,76,Lily:,"I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.
"
2,9,77,Ted:,"Hey.
"
2,9,78,Lily:,"What? The walls are thin.
"
2,9,79,Ted:,"That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.
"
2,9,80,Marshall:,"You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?
"
2,9,81,Ted:,"Married? What does have to do with the mall?
"
2,9,82,Marshall:,"Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...
"
2,9,83,Lily:,"We're not getting married at the mall.
"
2,9,84,Marshall:,"Just meet with the guy.
"
2,9,85,Ted:,"She's not married. Robin hates marriage.
"
2,9,86,Marshall:,"Because she already got married, at the mall.
"
2,9,87,Lily:,"No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?
"
2,9,88,Ted:,"Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.
"
2,9,89,Marshall:,"She's a pretty private person.
"
2,9,90,Lily:,"Except when she's talking about...
"
2,9,91,Robin:,"A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.
"
2,9,92,Lily:,"What do you think of this wedding cake?
"
2,9,93,Robin:,"Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.
"
2,9,94,Lily:,"No.
"
2,9,95,Robin:,"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.
"
2,9,96,Barney:,"They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.
"
2,9,97,Ted:,"So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?
"
2,9,98,Marshall:,"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.
"
2,9,99,Barney:,"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.
"
2,9,100,Ted:,"Thank you Barney.
"
2,9,101,Barney:,"'Cause it's p0rn.
"
2,9,102,Ted:,"I need another beer.
"
2,9,103,Marshall:,"Robin is not in p0rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.
"
2,9,104,Barney:,"20,000 says it's p0rn.
"
2,9,105,Marshall:,"I don't have 20,000.
"
2,9,106,Barney:,"Well then, what do you have?
"
2,9,107,Marshall:,"Well.
"
2,9,108,Lily:,"No.
"
2,9,109,Barney:,"I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.
"
2,9,110,Ted:,"Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.
"
2,9,111,Lily:,"What the hell's a slap bet?
"
2,9,112,Marshall:,"Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.
"
2,9,113,Lily:,"Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall: You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.
"
2,9,114,Lily:,"Oh, I love it. What are my powers?
"
2,9,115,Marshall:,"Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney: But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read ""Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner.""
"
2,9,116,Marshall:,"And your tombstone will read, ""got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.""
"
2,9,117,Ted:,"All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?
"
2,9,118,Lily:,"You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.
"
2,9,119,Ted:,"Yeah, you're right.
"
2,9,120,Ted:,"Husband.
"
2,9,121,Robin:,"There's no 'p' in husband.
"
2,9,122,Ted:,"Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.
"
2,9,123,Ted:,"Fine, I'll take it back.
"
2,9,124,Ted:,"Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.
"
2,9,125,Robin:,"Huh.
"
2,9,126,Ted:,"I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?
"
2,9,127,Robin:,"Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.
"
2,9,128,Robin:,"What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""
"
2,9,129,Robin:,"Ted, I don't understand why you can't...
"
2,9,130,Ted:,"Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""
"
2,9,131,Robin:,"I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.
"
2,9,132,Ted:,"Oh.
"
2,9,133,Ted:,"You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.
"
2,9,134,Ted:,"Why didn't you get divorced?
"
2,9,135,Robin:,"He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.
"
2,9,136,Ted:,"Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.
"
2,9,137,Robin:,"I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.
"
2,9,138,Ted:,"OK.
"
2,9,139,Barney:,"Your hand is monstrous.
"
2,9,140,Marshall:,"Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s.
"
2,9,141,Lily:,"I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.
"
2,9,142,Ted:,"How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.
"
2,9,143,Lily:,"No I didn't.
"
2,9,144,Lily:,"Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.
"
2,9,145,Ted:,"Fine, Robin's married.
"
2,9,146,Marshall:,"Ha ha ha.
"
2,9,147,Lily:,"Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?
"
2,9,148,Ted:,"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?
"
2,9,149,Barney:,"I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.
"
2,9,150,Ted:,"What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?
"
2,9,151,Lily:,"Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.
"
2,9,152,Ted:,"It's serious to me.
"
2,9,153,Marshall:,"You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.
"
2,9,154,Marshall:,"I can see my hand print on your face.
"
2,9,155,Barney:,"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p0rn from Canada I have to go through.
"
2,9,156,Marshall:,"I won the bet. Why are you still searching?
"
2,9,157,Barney:,"Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.
"
2,9,158,Lily:,"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p0rn.
"
2,9,159,Barney:,"Canadian p0rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind.
"
2,9,160,Ted:,"Hey.
"
2,9,161,Marshall:,"Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.
"
2,9,162,Ted:,"Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?
"
2,9,163,Marshall:,"Robin's not married.
"
2,9,164,Ted:,"What? Then, why would she tell me she was?
"
2,9,165,Marshall:,"I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.
"
2,9,166,Ted:,"There must be some mistake.
"
2,9,167,Marshall:,"I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.
"
2,9,168,Ted:,"So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.
"
2,9,169,Marshall:,"You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.
"
2,9,170,Ted:,"Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.
"
2,9,171,Robin:,"Thanks Ted.
"
2,9,172,Ted:,"Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.
"
2,9,173,Robin:,"I say we just move on.
"
2,9,174,Ted:,"In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.
"
2,9,175,Ted:,"Ah, Canada in June. That's great.
"
2,9,176,Ted:,"Sit down or buffet.
"
2,9,177,Robin:,"Um...
"
2,9,178,Ted:,"Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.
"
2,9,179,Robin:,"No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.
"
2,9,180,Ted:,"Hm. Band of DJ?
"
2,9,181,Robin:,"String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.
"
2,9,182,Ted:,"How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.
"
2,9,183,Ted:,"Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.
"
2,9,184,Ted:,"Color scheme?
"
2,9,185,Robin:,"Dusty rose and sienna.
"
2,9,186,Ted:,"Husband's name?
"
2,9,187,Robin:,"Um.
"
2,9,188,Ted:,"You were never married.
"
2,9,189,Robin:,"Yes I was.
"
2,9,190,Ted:,"No you weren't.
"
2,9,191,Robin:,"How do you know?
"
2,9,192,Ted:,"I looked it up at the library.
"
2,9,193,Robin:,"What library?
"
2,9,194,Ted:,"The one on 5th.
"
2,9,195,Robin:,"When did you go?
"
2,9,196,Ted:,"Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....
"
2,9,197,Robin:,"I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?
"
2,9,198,Ted:,"I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.
"
2,9,199,(Robin looks at Ted) Ted:,"Fine, Marshall looked it up in school.
"
2,9,200,Robin:,"You told Marshall?
"
2,9,201,Ted:,"You lied to me!
"
2,9,202,Robin:,"See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.
"
2,9,203,Ted:,"But it was a fake secret.
"
2,9,204,Robin:,"Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.
"
2,9,205,Ted:,"Testing me, that's insane.
"
2,9,206,Robin:,"Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?
"
2,9,207,Ted:,"That wasn't a real secret.
"
2,9,208,Robin:,"Yeah, but it could have been.
"
2,9,209,Ted:,"You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.
"
2,9,210,Robin:,"He moved there for business.
"
2,9,211,Barney:,"You, you got something to say to me?
"
2,9,212,Marshall:,"What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married.
"
2,9,213,Marshall:,"How could you possibly know that?
"
2,9,214,(flashback of Lily and Marshall talking in bed) Lily:,"And then I put on my pajamas and got into bed. What about you?
"
2,9,215,Marshall:,"Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...
"
2,9,216,Marshall:,"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.
"
2,9,217,Barney:,"Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.
"
2,9,218,Lily:,"Barney gets three slaps.
"
2,9,219,Marshall:,"Three?
"
2,9,220,Lily:,"One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.
"
2,9,221,Barney:,"Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry.
"
2,9,222,Ted:,"I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.
"
2,9,223,Robin:,"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.
"
2,9,224,Barney:,"So I just got a very interesting phone call.
"
2,9,225,Ted:,"What are you talking about?
"
2,9,226,Barney:,"I know Robin's secret.
"
2,9,227,Robin:,"What?
"
2,9,228,Barney:,"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.
"
2,9,229,Barney:,"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.
"
2,9,230,Ted:,"Yeah. No I don't.
"
2,9,231,Barney:,"What?
"
2,9,232,Ted:,"Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.
"
2,9,233,Barney:,"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!
"
2,9,234,Barney:,"Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.
"
2,9,235,Robin:,"Barney, don't, okay.
"
2,9,236,Barney:,"Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.
"
2,9,237,Ted:,"No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.
"
2,9,238,Robin:,"No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.
"
2,9,239,Lily:,"Are you as terrified as I am?
"
2,9,240,Marshall:,"I don't wanna get slapped again.
"
2,9,241,Robin:,"I wanna stress that I was young.
"
2,9,242,Barney:,"Yeah you were.
"
2,9,243,Robin:,"And I didn't know any better.
"
2,9,244,Barney:,"They never do.
"
2,9,245,Robin:,"And it started out as an innocent modeling job.
"
2,9,246,Barney:,"It always does.
"
2,9,247,Robin Sparkles:,"Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?
"
2,9,248,Ted:,"Oh my God.
"
2,9,249,Barney:,"Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.
"
2,9,250,Robin:,"What the hell was that?
"
2,9,251,Ted:,"I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.
"
2,9,252,Robin:,"p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing.
"
2,9,253,Robin Sparkles:,"I know, how about I sing you a song!
"
2,9,254,Robin Sparkles:,"Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori.
"
2,9,255,Robin:,"I was a teenage pop star in Canada.
"
2,9,256,Robin Sparkles:,"Put on your jelly bracelets and your cool graffiti coat. At the mall, having fun is what it's all about.
"
2,9,257,Lily:,"This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
"
2,9,258,Marshall:,"That's you?
"
2,9,259,Robin:,"Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.
"
2,9,260,Robin Sparkles:,"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today.
"
2,9,261,Marshall:,"This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?
"
2,9,262,Robin:,"The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.
"
2,9,263,Marshall:,"Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p0rn.
"
2,9,264,Lily:,"And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.
"
2,9,265,Marshall:,"Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation
"
2,9,266,Ted:,"Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.
"
2,9,267,Robin Sparkles:,"Went to the mall with a couple of friends. Had a whole week's allowance to spend.
"
2,9,268,Lily:,"OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.
"
2,9,269,"Marshall, Ted:","Cool.
"
2,9,270,Ted:,"Go with the 10 now.
"
2,9,271,Robin:,"No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?
"
2,9,272,Ted:,"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.
"
2,9,273,Barney:,"I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.
"
2,9,274,Robin:,"Good call.
"
2,9,275,Ted:,"Horrible call.
"
2,9,276,Marshall:,"Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.
"
2,9,277,Robin Sparkles:,"Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall
"
2,9,278,Lily:,"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?
"
2,9,279,Barney:,"Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.
"
2,9,280,Ted:,"Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.
"
2,9,281,Robin:,"You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.
"
2,9,282,"Lily, Marshall, Barney:","Aw.
"
2,9,283,Marshall:,"That's one.
"
2,9,284,Robin Sparkles:,"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!
"
2,9,285,Barney:,"Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.
"
2,9,286,Robin Sparkles:,"There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me.
"
2,9,287,Robot:,"But don't forget the robot.
"
2,9,288,Marshall:,"The robot! Hey!
"
2,9,289,Robin Sparkles:,"But, baby, I don't wanna wait.
"
2,9,290,Ted:,"No, she doesn't wanna wait.
"
2,9,291,Robin Sparkles:,"I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall (today). Let's go to the mall (today)...
"
2,21,1,Ted (2030):,"In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York.
"
2,21,2,Robin:,"Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.
"
2,21,3,Lily:,"Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.
"
2,21,4,Lily:,"So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.
"
2,21,5,Barney:,"And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.
"
2,21,6,Robin:,"But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?
"
2,21,7,Barney:,"Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah.
"
2,21,8,Ted (2030):,"The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.
"
2,21,9,Lily:,"Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.
"
2,21,10,Robin:,"Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.
"
2,21,11,Ted:,"Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?
"
2,21,12,Marshall:,"You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.
"
2,21,13,Lily:,"So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.
"
2,21,14,Lily:,"So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.
"
2,21,15,Barney:,"Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list.
"
2,21,16,Marshall:,"How long is this list?
"
2,21,17,Barney:,"Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.
"
2,21,18,Lily:,"Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.
"
2,21,19,Barney:,"Sweet! I can cross off two things.
"
2,21,20,Ted (2030):,"And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.
"
2,21,21,Andrea:,"Hi, Lily.
"
2,21,22,Lily:,"Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.
"
2,21,23,Andrea:,"Yeah.
"
2,21,24,Robin:,"How do you play the harp with your belly so...?
"
2,21,25,Andrea:,"Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.
"
2,21,26,Robin:,"You only play half the harp?
"
2,21,27,Andrea:,"Yeah.
"
2,21,28,Robin:,"Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?
"
2,21,29,Andrea:,"I've been studying the harp for 12 years.
"
2,21,30,Robin:,"Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?
"
2,21,31,Lily:,"Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?
"
2,21,32,Andrea:,"Tuesday.
"
2,21,33,Lily:,"Wow, that's soon.
"
2,21,34,Andrea:,"Last Tuesday.
"
2,21,35,Robin:,"Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.
"
2,21,36,Lily:,"Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.
"
2,21,37,Barney:,"Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?
"
2,21,38,Barman:,"No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.
"
2,21,39,Barney:,"Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.
"
2,21,40,Barman:,"I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.
"
2,21,41,Barney:,"You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.
"
2,21,42,Barney:,"Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?""
"
2,21,43,Robin:,"Really? That didn't work.
"
2,21,44,Barney:,"Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?
"
2,21,45,Lily:,"Bill?
"
2,21,46,Barney:,"Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.
"
2,21,47,Bill:,"Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?
"
2,21,48,Barney:,"Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.
"
2,21,49,Bill:,"Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?
"
2,21,50,Lily:,"Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?
"
2,21,51,Barney:,"He kind of did.
"
2,21,52,Lily:,"That's Scooter.
"
2,21,53,Robin:,"Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?
"
2,21,54,Lily:,"His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.
"
2,21,55,Robin:,"Why? Why would she do that?
"
2,21,56,Lily:,"Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.
"
2,21,57,Barney:,"I'll get it.
"
2,21,58,Lily:,"Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?
"
2,21,59,Barney:,"He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.
"
2,21,60,Lily:,"Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.
"
2,21,61,Barney:,"Me, too. I was up all night.
"
2,21,62,Scooter:,"Hello, Lily.
"
2,21,63,Barney:,"Hey, Bill.
"
2,21,64,Scooter:,"Hey, Barney.
"
2,21,65,Lily:,"Scooter, what are you doing here?
"
2,21,66,Scooter:,"It's not ""Scooter"" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back.
"
2,21,67,Lily:,"You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?
"
2,21,68,Lily:,"I want... I want... Scooter!
"
2,21,69,Barney:,"I need a glass of wine.
"
2,21,70,Barman:,"And I need you to get out of my face.
"
2,21,71,Barney:,"It's for the bride, so...
"
2,21,72,Barney:,"White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.
"
2,21,73,Barman:,"You got it.
"
2,21,74,Barney:,"She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.
"
2,21,75,Barman:,"I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.
"
2,21,76,Barney:,"Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.
"
2,21,77,Barney:,"Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.
"
2,21,78,Scooter:,"Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from ""November Rain."" By W. Axl Rose.
"
2,21,79,Robin:,"That is a good song.
"
2,21,80,Brad:,"Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?
"
2,21,81,Brad:,"What's up with Bill?
"
2,21,82,Robin:,"That's Scooter.
"
2,21,83,Brad:,"I'm on it.
"
2,21,84,Barney:,"Hey.
"
2,21,85,Woman:,"Hey.
"
2,21,86,Barney:,"Can I have your phone number?
"
2,21,87,Woman:,"No.
"
2,21,88,Barney:,"It's for the bride.
"
2,21,89,Woman:,"Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.
"
2,21,90,Barney:,"The bride wants you to walk slower.
"
2,21,91,Robin:,"Oh, wow.
"
2,21,92,Lily:,"Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.
"
2,21,93,Robin:,"I have hairy nipples.
"
2,21,94,Lily:,"Really?
"
2,21,95,Robin:,"No, but it worked, didn't it?
"
2,21,96,Brad:,"Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.
"
2,21,97,Robin:,"There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...
"
2,21,98,Lily:,"Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.
"
2,21,99,Woman:,"I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.
"
2,21,100,Lily:,"I'm okay.
"
2,21,101,Man:,"I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.
"
2,21,102,Lily:,"I'm fine.
"
2,21,103,Andrea:,"Just FYI: my water broke. But I can probably......make it through.
"
2,21,104,Lily:,"Totally cool.
"
2,21,105,Robin:,"Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.
"
2,21,106,Lily:,"Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.
"
2,21,107,Robin:,"Are you sure?
"
2,21,108,Lily:,"I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.
"
2,21,109,Robin:,"Lily, are you okay?
"
2,21,110,Lily:,"What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!
"
2,21,111,Robin:,"What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?
"
2,21,112,Lily:,"Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.
"
2,21,113,Robin:,"And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.
"
2,21,114,Lily:,"What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.
"
2,21,115,Marshall:,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
"
2,21,116,Ted:,"What?
"
2,21,117,Barney:,"Well, it's not too short.
"
2,21,118,Marshall:,"My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!
"
2,21,119,Barney:,"You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.
"
2,21,120,Ted:,"The good Backstreet Boys?
"
2,21,121,Marshall:,"Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!
"
2,21,122,Ted:,"What-what the hell happened to you?
"
2,21,123,Marshall:,"Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.
"
2,21,124,Marshall:,"So, um, just not-not too short, okay?
"
2,21,125,Cousin:,"Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style.
"
2,21,126,Marshall:,"Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.
"
2,21,127,Cousin:,"Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.
"
2,21,128,Marshall:,"I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.
"
2,21,129,Marshall:,"I can't get married like this! There's no way!
"
2,21,130,Barney:,"Ah, let me see what I can do.
"
2,21,131,Ted:,"What? What can you do?
"
2,21,132,Barney:,"I have a superpower.
"
2,21,133,Marshall:,"Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.
"
2,21,134,Ted:,"That's crazy. Of course she will.
"
2,21,135,Marshall:,"Would you marry me?
"
2,21,136,Ted:,"No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.
"
2,21,137,Marshall:,"Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?
"
2,21,138,Barney:,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?
"
2,21,139,Ted:,"Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.
"
2,21,140,Marshall:,"Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!
"
2,21,141,Ted:,"What?!
"
2,21,142,Marshall:,"You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.
"
2,21,143,Ted:,"Dude, those guys are criminals.
"
2,21,144,Marshall:,"Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!
"
2,21,145,Ted:,"Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.
"
2,21,146,Marshall:,"No!
"
2,21,147,Ted:,"Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?
"
2,21,148,Ben:,"Yes.
"
2,21,149,Ted:,"Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.
"
2,21,150,Ben:,"Yeah.
"
2,21,151,Ted:,"Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.
"
2,21,152,Ben:,"Oh, no!
"
2,21,153,Ted:,"Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?
"
2,21,154,Ben:,"Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.
"
2,21,155,Ted:,"Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches
"
2,21,156,Ben:,"Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.
"
2,21,157,Ted:,"That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.
"
2,21,158,Ben:,"Boy, that's a pretty tall order.
"
2,21,159,Ted:,"Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?
"
2,21,160,Ben:,"No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.
"
2,21,161,Ted:,"Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.
"
2,21,162,Barney:,"The bride needs this.
"
2,21,163,Marshall:,"Actually, I think it kinda works.
"
2,21,164,Ted:,"It totally does.
"
2,21,165,Marshall:,"Barney?
"
2,21,166,Barney:,"To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.
"
2,21,167,Marshall:,"Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?
"
2,21,168,Ted:,"It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.
"
2,21,169,Marshall:,"Oh, you know...
"
2,21,170,Ted:,"In a bad way.
"
2,21,171,Brad:,"Hey. Cool hair, bro.
"
2,21,172,Ted:,"What happened to your shirt?
"
2,21,173,Brad:,"I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.
"
2,21,174,Ted:,"You gonna put another shirt on?
"
2,21,175,Brad:,"No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?
"
2,21,176,Marshall:,"What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?
"
2,21,177,Brad:,"Not for long, bro. Not for long.
"
2,21,178,Marshall:,"Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?
"
2,21,179,Barney:,"It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.
"
2,21,180,Ted:,"Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.
"
2,21,181,Marshall:,"Oh, no.
"
2,21,182,Lily:,"Oh, my God! Marshall...
"
2,21,183,Marshall:,"Lily, you're not supposed to see me.
"
2,21,184,Robin:,"Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.
"
2,21,185,Lily:,"What happened? Did Amy do this to you?
"
2,21,186,Marshall:,"Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?
"
2,21,187,Lily:,"Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.
"
2,21,188,Marshall:,"Yeah, I know. I heard.
"
2,21,189,Lily:,"My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.
"
2,21,190,Marshall:,"What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?
"
2,21,191,Lily:,"What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?
"
2,21,192,Marshall:,"I wish we could have that wedding.
"
2,21,193,Ted:,"So do it.
"
2,21,194,Marshall:,"What?
"
2,21,195,Ted:,"Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.
"
2,21,196,Barney:,"Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.
"
2,21,197,Marshall:,"Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?
"
2,21,198,Robin:,"Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.
"
2,21,199,Marshall:,"What do you think, baby?
"
2,21,200,Lily:,"I love it.
"
2,21,201,Marshall:,"Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.
"
2,21,202,Lily:,"Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?
"
2,21,203,Man:,"Okay.
"
2,21,204,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
2,21,205,Marshall:,"Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.
"
2,21,206,Barney:,"Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.
"
2,21,207,Robin:,"He's gonna cry.
"
2,21,208,Barney:,"No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?
"
2,21,209,Marshall:,"Oh, no. I don't have my vows.
"
2,21,210,Lily:,"I don't have mine either.
"
2,21,211,Ted:,"You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.
"
2,21,212,Marshall:,"Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.
"
2,21,213,Ted:,"No problem.
"
2,21,214,Barney:,"It's totally okay.
"
2,21,215,Lily:,"My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.
"
2,21,216,Robin:,"Hey, I found your panties!
"
2,21,217,Lily:,"I'm good.
"
2,21,218,Barney:,"Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?
"
2,21,219,Lily:,"Slow down.
"
2,21,220,Barney:,"I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?
"
2,21,221,Marshall:,"I do.
"
2,21,222,Barney:,"Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?
"
2,21,223,Lily:,"I do.
"
2,21,224,Barney:,"Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
"
2,21,225,Marshall:,"Did you smoke?
"
2,21,226,Lily:,"No.
"
2,21,227,Robin:,"Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.
"
2,21,228,Ted (2030):,"After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.
"
2,21,229,Marshall:,"How do you feel?
"
2,21,230,Lily:,"Tired. I got married twice today.
"
2,21,231,Marshall:,"So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?
"
2,21,232,Lily:,"What do you think? Bathroom, of course.
"
2,21,233,Ted:,"Please don't.
"
2,21,234,Marshall and Lily:,"Sorry, Ted.
"
2,22,1,Man:,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever Mr. and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin.
"
2,22,2,Lily:,"Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?
"
2,22,3,Marshall:,"You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little.
"
2,22,4,Lily:,"You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.
"
2,22,5,Marshall:,"Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker.
"
2,22,6,Lily:,"Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.
"
2,22,7,Marshall:,"I got it. You ready? You ready?
"
2,22,8,Lily:,"Yeah.
"
2,22,9,Marshall:,"Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?
"
2,22,10,Lily:,"I love you, Mr. Awesome.
"
2,22,11,Marshall:,"I love you, Mrs. Awesome.
"
2,22,12,Ted:,"So...
"
2,22,13,Robin:,"So...
"
2,22,14,Ted:,"Wedding's over.
"
2,22,15,Robin:,"Yes, it is.
"
2,22,16,Ted:,"I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.
"
2,22,17,Barney:,"Tell people what?
"
2,22,18,Robin:,"Hi, Barney.
"
2,22,19,Barney:,"Tell people what?
"
2,22,20,Ted:,"The food looks delicious, doesn't it?
"
2,22,21,Barney:,"Tell people what?
"
2,22,22,Robin:,"Nothing.
"
2,22,23,Barney:,"Oh, okay. Tell people what?
"
2,22,24,Ted:,"Can we talk about this later?
"
2,22,25,Barney:,"Absolutely. Tell people what?
"
2,22,26,Robin:,"Hi. Have you met Barney?
"
2,22,27,Barney:,"Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?
"
2,22,28,Ted:,"Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?
"
2,22,29,Barney:,"Okay. (Barney leaves)
"
2,22,30,Ted:,"Whoo, that was a close one.
"
2,22,31,Robin:,"Think he'll actually let it go?
"
2,22,32,Robin:,"Can I get a water please?
"
2,22,33,Barney:,"Tell people what?
"
2,22,34,Robin:,"Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.
"
2,22,35,Ted:,"But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.
"
2,22,36,Robin:,"So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.
"
2,22,37,Barney:,"Fine.
"
2,22,38,Ted:,"It's pretty big, though.
"
2,22,39,Barney:,"Oh, my God, just tell me!
"
2,22,40,Lily:,"Oh, help us.
"
2,22,41,Robin:,"What's wrong?
"
2,22,42,Lily:,"We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it.
"
2,22,43,Marshall:,"Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day.
"
2,22,44,Robin:,"All right, let's run some interference.
"
2,22,45,Ted:,"Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.
"
2,22,46,Lily's grandma:,"Oh, there you are. My dear, you look so beautiful.
"
2,22,47,Lily:,"Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to...
"
2,22,48,Lily's grandma:,"And you... you look like a 1940s movie star.
"
2,22,49,Marshall:,"And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.
"
2,22,50,Robin:,"All right, let's get these two back to their table.
"
2,22,51,Lily's grandma:,"We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we?
"
2,22,52,Ted(2030):,"The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier.
"
2,22,53,Robin:,"Conga line.
"
2,22,54,Lily:,"Oh, yes, definitely.
"
2,22,55,Ted:,"How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" and ending with your baby photos side by side.
"
2,22,56,Lily:,"Oh, that's great. Going on the list.
"
2,22,57,Barney:,"What list?
"
2,22,58,Lily:,"Horrible wedding clich√©es we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.
"
2,22,59,Barney:,"Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.
"
2,22,60,Robin:,"How's it go?
"
2,22,61,Marshall:,"""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things.""
"
2,22,62,Robin:,"Lame.
"
2,22,63,Lily:,"Going on the list.
"
2,22,64,Lily:,"We've done it. A wedding with zero clich√©es.
"
2,22,65,Ted:,"Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clich√©e?
"
2,22,66,Lily:,"Well, okay, one clich√©e.
"
2,22,67,Marshall:,"Well, technically two.
"
2,22,68,Lily:,"No! They cleared our plates again!
"
2,22,69,Marshall:,"Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you.
"
2,22,70,Lily:,"Well, you still have me.
"
2,22,71,Marshall:,"Yeah...
"
2,22,72,Barney:,"Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.
"
2,22,73,Lily:,"No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...
"
2,22,74,Barney:,"Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.
"
2,22,75,Ted:,"Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?
"
2,22,76,Barney:,"Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.
"
2,22,77,Ted:,"What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.
"
2,22,78,Barney:,"Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.
"
2,22,79,Robin:,"Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...
"
2,22,80,Waiter:,"Champagne?
"
2,22,81,Robin:,"Um, we didn't order champagne.
"
2,22,82,Waiter:,"Compliments of the house.
"
2,22,83,Ted:,"Wow. Thanks. Cheers.
"
2,22,84,Robin (voive over):,"And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is...
"
2,22,85,Lily:,"Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.
"
2,22,86,Barney:,"Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?
"
2,22,87,Ted:,"Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow.""
"
2,22,88,Barney:,"You said that already!
"
2,22,89,Ted (voice over):,"Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass...
"
2,22,90,Robin:,"Is an engagement ring.
"
2,22,91,Man( with a camera):,"Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?
"
2,22,92,Barney:,"Don't get married.
"
2,22,93,Man:,"Why don't I come back.
"
2,22,94,Barney:,"An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do
"
2,22,95,Ted:,"That's what she said.
"
2,22,96,Robin:,"No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.
"
2,22,97,Ted:,"What are you talking about?
"
2,22,98,Robin:,"This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.
"
2,22,99,Ted:,"That's not mine.
"
2,22,100,Robin:,"What?
"
2,22,101,Ted:,"That's not mine.
"
2,22,102,Robin:,"Then whose is it?
"
2,22,103,Man:,"It's mine. Janna... will you marry me?
"
2,22,104,Janna:,"Yes.
"
2,22,105,Robin:,"Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.
"
2,22,106,Ted:,"What the hell was that?
"
2,22,107,Robin:,"What the hell was what?
"
2,22,108,Ted:,"That reaction?
"
2,22,109,Robin:,"I thought you were proposing to me.
"
2,22,110,Ted:,"Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.
"
2,22,111,Robin:,"Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.
"
2,22,112,Ted:,"Now more than ever.
"
2,22,113,Robin:,"I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?
"
2,22,114,Ted:,"No.
"
2,22,115,Robin:,"Then why is this an issue?
"
2,22,116,Ted:,"Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no.""
"
2,22,117,Robin:,"Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?
"
2,22,118,Ted:,"No.
"
2,22,119,Marshall:,"Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain.
"
2,22,120,Robin:,"So did you guys find anything to eat?
"
2,22,121,Lily:,"I had four strawberries.
"
2,22,122,Ted:,"Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?
"
2,22,123,Lily (burping):,"Yes.
"
2,22,124,Marshall:,"Lily, you could have burped or said the word ""Yes,"" but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.
"
2,22,125,Lily:,"Oh, look, more strawberries!
"
2,22,126,Barney:,"So what happened next?
"
2,22,127,Robin:,"Ted, don't do this.
"
2,22,128,Ted:,"No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?
"
2,22,129,Robin:,"Where do you see yourself?
"
2,22,130,Ted:,"Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.
"
2,22,131,Robin:,"And I probably want to be in Argentina.
"
2,22,132,Ted:,"Argentina?
"
2,22,133,Robin:,"Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.
"
2,22,134,Ted:,"We have an expiration date, don't we?
"
2,22,135,Barney:,"Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.
"
2,22,136,Ted:,"Barney... story's not over.
"
2,22,137,Robin:,"Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?
"
2,22,138,Ted:,"Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...
"
2,22,139,Waiter:,"Oh, my God, it's you.
"
2,22,140,Ted:,"Wha... what?
"
2,22,141,Waiter:,"You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.
"
2,22,142,Ted:,"Run!
"
2,22,143,Barney:,"Run? Your strategy was run?
"
2,22,144,Ted:,"It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.
"
2,22,145,Robin:,"Yeah? And how did that work out for you?
"
2,22,146,Ted:,"I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.
"
2,22,147,Robin:,"Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?
"
2,22,148,Ted:,"Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!
"
2,22,149,Ted:,"So... Argentina.
"
2,22,150,Robin:,"Argentina.
"
2,22,151,Ted:,"Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?
"
2,22,152,Robin:,"Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.
"
2,22,153,Ted:,"I could want to live in Argentina.
"
2,22,154,Robin:,"No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.
"
2,22,155,Ted:,"Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.
"
2,22,156,Robin:,"So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?
"
2,22,157,Ted:,"Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.
"
2,22,158,Robin:,"Oh, shut up.
"
2,22,159,Ted:,"You're scared I might not be kidding.
"
2,22,160,Robin:,"Aren't you?
"
2,22,161,Ted:,"Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.
"
2,22,162,Robin:,"Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.
"
2,22,163,Barney:,"No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.
"
2,22,164,Robin:,"Right? Right?
"
2,22,165,Barney:,"You caught the bouquet?
"
2,22,166,Ted:,"Barney. The story's not over yet.
"
2,22,167,Robin:,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"
2,22,168,Ted:,"What?
"
2,22,169,Robin:,"I don't know if I can do this to you.
"
2,22,170,Ted:,"Do what?
"
2,22,171,Robin:,"Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.
"
2,22,172,Ted:,"Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina.
"
2,22,173,Robin:,"You know what I mean.
"
2,22,174,Ted:,"No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.
"
2,22,175,Robin:,"Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.
"
2,22,176,Barney:,"That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted.
"
2,22,177,Robin:,"Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?
"
2,22,178,Robin:,"Well, we probably shouldn't.
"
2,22,179,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
2,22,180,Robin:,"Risk it?
"
2,22,181,Ted:,"Risk it.
"
2,22,182,Barney:,"No.
"
2,22,183,Man:,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake.
"
2,22,184,Barney:,"No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over.
"
2,22,185,Robin:,"Come on, they're cutting the cake.
"
2,22,186,Barney:,"Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.
"
2,22,187,Marshall:,"Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clich√©e, remember?
"
2,22,188,Lily:,"No, it's going to be so funny.
"
2,22,189,Marshall:,"Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry. (Lily's so drunk that she falls)
"
2,22,190,Lily:,"Whoopsy-daisy.
"
2,22,191,Marshall:,"And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much.
"
2,22,192,Lily:,"We love you. I love you.
"
2,22,193,Barney:,"Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.
"
2,22,194,Man:,"God, this guy's giving me nothing.
"
2,22,195,Ted:,"All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, ""What's up?""
"
2,22,196,Marshall:,"Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave.
"
2,22,197,Ted:,"Hey, kiddo.
"
2,22,198,Ted:,"The story's not over, Barney.
"
2,22,199,Ted:,"Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.
"
2,22,200,Robin:,"Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.
"
2,22,201,Ted:,"Not a euphemism.
"
2,22,202,Robin:,"Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.
"
2,22,203,Ted:,"Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.
"
2,22,204,Robin:,"That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.
"
2,22,205,Ted:,"Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...
"
2,22,206,Robin:,"Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?
"
2,22,207,Ted:,"We're not doing this, are we?
"
2,22,208,Robin:,"I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
"
2,22,209,Ted:,"And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
"
2,22,210,Robin:,"So where does that leave us?
"
2,22,211,Ted:,"Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.
"
2,22,212,Robin:,"You stole a blue French horn for me.
"
2,22,213,Ted:,"I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.
"
2,22,214,Barney:,"You did break up.
"
2,22,215,Ted:,"Yep.
"
2,22,216,Barney:,"You're not pregnant?
"
2,22,217,Robin:,"Nope.
"
2,22,218,Barney:,"An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?
"
2,22,219,Ted:,"Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...
"
2,22,220,Robin:,"We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.
"
2,22,221,Barney:,"You guys okay?
"
2,22,222,Ted:,"Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...
"
2,22,223,Robin:,"But we're okay.
"
2,22,224,Ted:,"The open bar helps.
"
2,22,225,Kid:,"Excuse me, Miss.
"
2,22,226,Robin:,"Hi.
"
2,22,227,Kid:,"Could I have this dance?
"
2,22,228,Ted:,"Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man.
"
2,22,229,Marshall:,"This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you. Uh, driver.
"
2,22,230,Ranjit:,"Hello!
"
2,22,231,Marshall:,"Ranjit!! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel?
"
2,22,232,Ranjit:,"You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch.
"
2,22,233,Marshall:,"Um, no, we actually had something else in mind.
"
2,22,234,Ranjit:,"Okay.
"
2,22,235,Marshall:,"Lily, go sit down.
"
2,22,236,Man:,"Welcome to Wienerburger.
"
2,22,237,Marshall:,"Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions.
"
2,22,238,Man:,"Let me guess. Jefferson High prom?
"
2,22,239,Marshall:,"No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married.
"
2,22,240,Man:,"Wow. Congratulations.
"
2,22,241,Marshall:,"Thank you.
"
2,22,242,Man:,"That's $7.80. Hey, dude.
"
2,22,243,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
2,22,244,Man:,"I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash.
"
2,22,245,Marshall:,"My wife...
"
2,22,246,Ted (2030):,"So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar.
"
2,22,247,Barney:,"I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.
"
2,22,248,Ted:,"Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?
"
2,22,249,Barney:,"The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for ""the one"" again. The only time I want to hear you saying ""the one"" is if it's followed by the word ""hundredth."" What up?
"
2,22,250,Ted:,"No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?
"
2,22,251,Barney:,"Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.
"
2,22,252,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
2,22,253,Barney:,"I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.
"
2,22,254,Ted:,"Could be.
"
2,22,255,Barney:,"Ted?
"
2,22,256,Ted:,"Yes, Barney.
"
2,22,257,Barney:,"Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?
"
2,22,258,Ted:,"I do.
"
2,22,259,Barney:,"Yes! Yes! We're back. We are back. And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend... Wait for it...
"
2,18,1,"So, I can have the moving truck here by 8:","0 am.
"
2,18,2,"Hey, hypothetical question:","if I was all your stuff, would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?
"
2,18,3,The category:,"top ten things I would've called my truck...
"
2,15,1,Ted (voix off):,"Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago.
"
2,15,2,Robin:,"That security guard was a little bit handsy.
"
2,15,3,Ted:,"That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.
"
2,15,4,Ted (voix off):,"Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.
"
2,15,5,Ted:,"Hi, wait, two more.
"
2,15,6,Woman:,"Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.
"
2,15,7,Ted:,"Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.
"
2,15,8,Woman:,"Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy.
"
2,15,9,Ted:,"Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.
"
2,15,10,Woman:,"I'm sorry, sir.
"
2,15,11,Robin:,"His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.
"
2,15,12,Ted:,"Please, I have to be on this flight.
"
2,15,13,Woman:,"I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.
"
2,15,14,Ted:,"Thanks.
"
2,15,15,Robin:,"Your uniforms are pretty.
"
2,15,16,Woman:,"Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.
"
2,15,17,Ted:,"Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.
"
2,15,18,Woman:,"Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after.
"
2,15,19,Ted:,"Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.
"
2,15,20,Rubin:,"Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.
"
2,15,21,Woman:,"You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. (The phone rings) Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?
"
2,15,22,Ted:,"That thing better have call waiting.
"
2,15,23,Robin:,"Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?
"
2,15,24,Ted:,"It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?
"
2,15,25,Robin:,"Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?
"
2,15,26,Ted (voix off):,"She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.
"
2,15,27,Robin:,"Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?
"
2,15,28,Marshall:,"Oh, man, it kills.
"
2,15,29,Lily:,"You want some aspirin, baby?
"
2,15,30,Marshall:,"You know I don't believe in pain killers.
"
2,15,31,Ted:,"Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory.
"
2,15,32,Lily:,"Marshall used to think he was indestructible.
"
2,15,33,Marshall:,"Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.
"
2,15,34,Ted:,"There was a really heavy door. He opened it.
"
2,15,35,Marshall:,"On one pull.
"
2,15,36,Robin:,"Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.
"
2,15,37,Marshall:,"Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.
"
2,15,38,Barney:,"Training for a marathon.
"
2,15,39,Marshall:,"What?
"
2,15,40,Barney:,"You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.
"
2,15,41,Marshall:,"You're kidding, right?
"
2,15,42,Barney:,"Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.
"
2,15,43,Marshall:,"So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?
"
2,15,44,Barney:,"Absolutely.
"
2,15,45,Robin:,"Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.
"
2,15,46,Ted:,"Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.
"
2,15,47,Barney:,"Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.
"
2,15,48,Marshall:,
2,15,49,Barney:,"50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.
"
2,15,50,Marshall:,"You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.
"
2,15,51,Barney:,"Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.
"
2,15,52,Ted (voix off):,"The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.
"
2,15,53,Marshall:,"Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.
"
2,15,54,Robin:,"Ooh, he's starting!
"
2,15,55,Marshall:,"This ought to be good. Wow. (48 minutes later) He's already passing the second checkpoint.
"
2,15,56,Lily:,"This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.
"
2,15,57,Robin:,"Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.
"
2,15,58,Marshall:,"He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.
"
2,15,59,Ted:,"Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?
"
2,15,60,Marshall:,"Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.
"
2,15,61,Marshall:,"It's really him.
"
2,15,62,Lily:,"Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!
"
2,15,63,Barney:,"What up, non-finishers?
"
2,15,64,Ted:,"Wow. Very impressive, Barney.
"
2,15,65,Barney:,"Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.
"
2,15,66,Lily:,"I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.
"
2,15,67,Barney:,"So where's my 50 bucks?
"
2,15,68,Marshall:,"All right. I got to admit, you earned this.
"
2,15,69,Barney:,"Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.
"
2,15,70,Marshall:,"Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.
"
2,15,71,Barney:,"Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.
"
2,15,72,Ted:,"You're dating a girl from New Jersey?
"
2,15,73,Barney:,"No.
"
2,15,74,Ted (voix off):,"So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.
"
2,15,75,Ted:,"Hello?
"
2,15,76,Barney:,"Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.
"
2,15,77,Ted:,"What, what are you talking about?
"
2,15,78,Barney:,"I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.
"
2,15,79,Barney:,"Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.
"
2,15,80,Voice:,"86th street.
"
2,15,81,Barney:,"My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.
"
2,15,82,Ted:,"(to Marshall) Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.
"
2,15,83,Marshall:,"Best 50 bucks I ever spent.
"
2,15,84,Barney:,"Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?
"
2,15,85,Ted:,"All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.
"
2,15,86,Barney:,"Ted, Ted.
"
2,15,87,Woman:,"Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?
"
2,15,88,Barney:,"I'm sorry. I can't.
"
2,15,89,Old lady:,"Douche.
"
2,15,90,Ted:,"Barney?!
"
2,15,91,Barney:,"Ted!
"
2,15,92,Policeman:,"Hey!
"
2,15,93,Barney:,"No...!
"
2,15,94,Robin:,"See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.
"
2,15,95,Ted:,"You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.
"
2,15,96,Woman:,"So I was able to get you two seats.
"
2,15,97,Ted:,"Really? That's great!
"
2,15,98,Woman:,"No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?
"
2,15,99,Ted:,"Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?
"
2,15,100,Woman:,"I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.
"
2,15,101,Ted:,"What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.
"
2,15,102,Robin:,"Well, he never even called you back?
"
2,15,103,Woman:,"Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.
"
2,15,104,Ted (voix off):,"It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.
"
2,15,105,Robin:,"What was the name of the airline again?
"
2,15,106,Ted:,"I think it was something like Flights R' Us.
"
2,15,107,Robin:,"Was the ""R"" backwards?
"
2,15,108,Ted:,"God, I hope not.
"
2,15,109,Robin:,"Geez.
"
2,15,110,Ted:,"Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.
"
2,15,111,Robin:,"If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.
"
2,15,112,Ted:,"You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
"
2,15,113,Robin:,"Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?
"
2,15,114,Ted (voix off):,"For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.
"
2,15,115,Marshall:,"My pants are starting to feel a little tight.
"
2,15,116,Lily:,"Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.
"
2,15,117,Marshall:,"I cannot allow this.
"
2,15,118,Lily:,"What?
"
2,15,119,Marshall:,"I am going to run the New York City Marathon.
"
2,15,120,Lily:,"""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.
"
2,15,121,Marshall:,"Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.
"
2,15,122,Lily:,"""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.""
"
2,15,123,Marshall:,"This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!
"
2,15,124,Lily:,"""Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.""
"
2,15,125,Marshall:,"Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.
"
2,15,126,Robin:,"Marshall? Oh, my God!
"
2,15,127,Ted:,"So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.
"
2,15,128,Robin:,"That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on
"
2,15,129,Robin:,"Hey, what's going on here?
"
2,15,130,Ted:,"Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.
"
2,15,131,Robin:,"Yeah, but for what?
"
2,15,132,Ted:,"I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.""
"
2,15,133,Robin:,"Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?
"
2,15,134,Lily:,"We have to camp out.
"
2,15,135,Robin:,"Are you serious?
"
2,15,136,Lily:,"You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.
"
2,15,137,Barney:," I can't go. I've got this thing.
"
2,15,138,Lily:,"What thing?
"
2,15,139,Barney:,"A pen1s.
"
2,15,140,Robin:,"This is the place.
"
2,15,141,Lily:,"Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?
"
2,15,142,Robin:,"You said wang.
"
2,15,143,Lily:,"Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.
"
2,15,144,Robin:,"You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.
"
2,15,145,Lily:,"Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.
"
2,15,146,Robin:,"That's kind of annoying.
"
2,15,147,Lily:,"Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?
"
2,15,148,Robin:,"It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?
"
2,15,149,Lily:,"If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.
"
2,15,150,Robin:,"I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.
"
2,15,151,Man:,"Morning, ladies.
"
2,15,152,Lily:,"It's him. It's the car guy!
"
2,15,153,Robin:,"Get out of here!
"
2,15,154,Ted (voix off):,"The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...
"
2,15,155,Marshall:,"Nobody does it better than you.
"
2,15,156,Robin:,"Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)
"
2,15,157,Robin:,"So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.
"
2,15,158,Ted:,"Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.
"
2,15,159,Man:,"Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.
"
2,15,160,Robin:,"Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.
"
2,15,161,Man:,"You did that story on the giant pizzas?
"
2,15,162,Ted:,"Would you check to see if you have any more seats?
"
2,15,163,Man:,"One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?
"
2,15,164,Ted:,"Robin...
"
2,15,165,Robin:," One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,
"
2,15,166,Man:," I knew it!
"
2,15,167,Robin:,"God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.
"
2,15,168,Man:,"Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.
"
2,15,169,Ted:,"Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?
"
2,15,170,Man:,"I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.
"
2,15,171,Robin:,"Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?
"
2,15,172,Ted:,"No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?
"
2,15,173,Ted:,"1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?
"
2,15,174,Robin:,"Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.
"
2,15,175,Ted:,"Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.
"
2,15,176,Robin:,"No, it's not.
"
2,15,177,Ted:,"Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.
"
2,15,178,Ted( voix off):,"And that's exactly what I did.
"
2,15,179,Robin:,"You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.
"
2,15,180,Ted:,"Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.
"
2,15,181,Robin:,"Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.
"
2,15,182,Ted:,"How dare you.
"
2,15,183,Robin:,"Hey, what's going on?
"
2,15,184,Ted:,"I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.
"
2,15,185,Robin:,"Yeah, but for what?
"
2,15,186,Ted:,"It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.
"
2,15,187,Robin:,"And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.
"
2,15,188,Ted:,"Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...
"
2,15,189,Robin:,"And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.
"
2,15,190,Ted:,"I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.
"
2,15,191,Man:,"Uh, sir?
"
2,15,192,Ted:,"Oh, please tell me you have some good news.
"
2,15,193,Man:,"Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.
"
2,15,194,Robin:,"All, right, well, thanks for trying.
"
2,15,195,Ted:,"I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.
"
2,15,196,Robin:,"Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.
"
2,15,197,Ted (voix off):,"But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.
"
2,1,1,Ted:,"OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.
"
2,1,2,Ted's daughter:,"an't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom? I feel you've been talking for like a year
"
2,1,3,Ted:,"Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.
"
2,1,4,Ted's son:,"Can I go to the bathroom?
"
2,1,5,Ted:,"No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. (In 2006, Ted and Robin are kissing after the rain dance) In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his (Ted finds Marshall on their stairs, holding in his hand Lily's engagement ring).
"
2,1,6,Marshall:,"So that's it? We're breaking up?
"
2,1,7,Lily:,"Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.
"
2,1,8,Marshall:,"For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.
"
2,1,9,Marshall:,"I should call her.
"
2,1,10,Ted:,"No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.
"
2,1,11,Marshall:,"You're a good friend Ted.
"
2,1,12,Robin:,"Hey! So, did you hear the big news?
"
2,1,13,Ted:,"You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.
"
2,1,14,Robin:,"Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?
"
2,1,15,Marshall:,"Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.
"
2,1,16,Barney:,"I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.
"
2,1,17,Marshall:,"Thanks.
"
2,1,18,Barney:,"I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?
"
2,1,19,Marshall:,"Sure.
"
2,1,20,Ted from 2030:,"One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning (Ted and Robin are making out) and love is ending (Lily is leaving the apartment, leaving Marshall alone) the first thirty days are remarkably similar. (DAY ONE, Ted and Robin are in bed after they had s*x) For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed (Marshall is in his bed groaning // DAY EIGHT, Ted and Robin are at MacLaren's with Barney, kissing and laughing. Barney seems to kill himself, miming a gun in his mouth) Your friends can't stand to listen to you (DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says ""It was a really beautiful song"". Barney mimes a rope around his neck). And you never seems to wear pants. (DAY TWENTY-TWO, at the apartment, Robin is going to the bathroom only wearing a T-shirt while Marshall is wallowing on the couch in underpants. Ted, in underpants too, comes out of his room).
"
2,1,21,Ted:,"Hey Marshall.
"
2,1,22,Marshall:,"Hey Ted.
"
2,1,23,Ted:,"Are you hungry?
"
2,1,24,Marshall:,"What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.
"
2,1,25,Ted:,"At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!
"
2,1,26,Marshall:,"Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.
"
2,1,27,Ted:,"Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?
"
2,1,28,Marshall:,"Beer.
"
2,1,29,Ted:,"No, that's what you had for dinner.
"
2,1,30,Marshall:,"Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover
"
2,1,31,Barney:,"So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fianc√©e. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.
"
2,1,32,Ted:,"You should write and illustrate children's books.
"
2,1,33,Barney:,"You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.
"
2,1,34,Ted:,"It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.
"
2,1,35,Robin:,"Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.
"
2,1,36,Ted:,"Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...
"
2,1,37,Robin:,"What?
"
2,1,38,Ted:,"God, your eyes are so blue.
"
2,1,39,Robin:,"Teddy bear... (They kiss, Barney mimes his death with a sword. Ted and Robin look at him and keep kissing)
"
2,1,40,Ted from 2030:,"Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. (Ted and Robin are watching TV, Marshall comes out of the bathroom, a bottle of shampoo in his hand).
"
2,1,41,Marshall:,"So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.
"
2,1,42,Robin:,"That's my shampoo.
"
2,1,43,Marshall:,"Oh. Sorry.
"
2,1,44,Robin:,"I thought he's never go to sleep.
"
2,1,45,Ted:,"Uh-oh.
"
2,1,46,Robin:,"Already?
"
2,1,47,Ted:,"He's calling her. Dammit!
"
2,1,48,Robin:,"I don't hear anyth...Ted (going out of the bedroom): He's calling her! (Tackling Marshall) Argh!
"
2,1,49,Marshall:,"Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.
"
2,1,50,Marshall:,"Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!
"
2,1,51,Robin (to Ted):,"Does he know I'm in here?
"
2,1,52,Marshall:,"Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...
"
2,1,53,Robin:,"This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...
"
2,1,54,Barney:,"Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!
"
2,1,55,Ted:,"They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.
"
2,1,56,Robin:,"He slept on our floor last night Ted.
"
2,1,57,Ted:,"He watched a scary movie.
"
2,1,58,Robin:,"It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.
"
2,1,59,Barney:,"Mmm. Sunshine.
"
2,1,60,Man:,"Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!
"
2,1,61,Marshall:,"Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.
"
2,1,62,Marshall:,"There are a lot of them.
"
2,1,63,Barney:,"They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.
"
2,1,64,Ted:,"Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!
"
2,1,65,Marshall:,"I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.
"
2,1,66,Man:,"Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.
"
2,1,67,Ted:,"Oh, no. (A man is proposing to his girlfriend. Marshall stands up and throws a hotdog at the engaged couple.)
"
2,1,68,Marshall:,"It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart! (Men drag Marshall out of the stadium) You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!
"
2,1,69,Ted:,"We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.
"
2,1,70,Robin:,"See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
"
2,1,71,Barney:,"So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? (Ted and Barney laugh)
"
2,1,72,Robin:,"Yeah, that's the stuff.
"
2,1,73,Marshall:,"Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?
"
2,1,74,Robin:,"My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... guns are fun!
"
2,1,75,Marshall:,"Um, you know, Ted is kinda against guns.Robin (turning to Marshall, her gun still in her hand): That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a gun, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try?
"
2,1,76,Marshall:,"Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... (He shoots and falls down)
"
2,1,77,Robin:,"I should have mention the recoil.
"
2,1,78,Ted:,"I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.
"
2,1,79,Robin:,"Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. (We see Marshall shooting and laughing maniacally )
"
2,1,80,Ted:,"Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.
"
2,1,81,Robin:,"Oh! What do I win?
"
2,1,82,Ted:,"I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.
"
2,1,83,Robin:,"You are? That's so nice!
"
2,1,84,Ted:,"My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.
"
2,1,85,Robin:,"Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?
"
2,1,86,Marshall:,"Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.
"
2,1,87,Ted:,"Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?
"
2,1,88,Marshall:,"It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.
"
2,1,89,Ted:,"So?
"
2,1,90,Marshall:,"I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.
"
2,1,91,Ted:,"No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.
"
2,1,92,Marshall:,"I know, but I just...
"
2,1,93,Marshall:,"August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?
"
2,1,94,Lily:,"Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around.
"
2,1,95,George Clinton:,"Only the best for my little Lily Pad.
"
2,1,96,Lily:,"Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style.
"
2,1,97,George Clinton:,"I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.
"
2,1,98,Lily:,"Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.
"
2,1,99,George Clinton:,"I got you a gift.
"
2,1,100,Lily:,"Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.
"
2,1,101,George Clinton:,"I bet that's something he made you promise to tell nobody.
"
2,1,102,Lily:,"It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.
"
2,1,103,George Clinton:,"I love you too, Lily. That's right Marshall, she's all mine. Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.
"
2,1,104,Ted:,"That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
"
2,1,105,Robin:,"Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.
"
2,1,106,Marshall:,"Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.
"
2,1,107,Barney:,"Those charges are from a month ago.
"
2,1,108,Ted:,"Exactly!
"
2,1,109,Barney:,"For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... (Marshall leaves the bar, running).
"
2,1,110,Ted:,"Why do you talk? Why do you talk?
"
2,1,111,Barney:,"He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.
"
2,1,112,Marshall:,"There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York. (...) I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.
"
2,1,113,Robin (to Ted):,"This has been holding in together?
"
2,1,114,Marshall:,"OK, you know what? I'm calling her.
"
2,1,115,Ted:,"No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. (To Barney) You, come here. (Barney and Robin follow Ted in the kitchen). While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.
"
2,1,116,Barney:,"You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.
"
2,1,117,Ted:,"Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. (To Robin) Come here my little baby. (Ted and Robin are making out)
"
2,1,118,Barney:,"OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.
"
2,1,119,Robin:,"Marshall!
"
2,1,120,Ted:,"Marshall! Marshall!
"
2,1,121,Marshall:,"Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to!
"
2,1,122,Ted:,"Everything we've worked so hard for...!
"
2,1,123,Marshall:,"Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you.
"
2,1,124,Ted:,"Hang up now!
"
2,1,125,Marshall:,"Ted, I can't hang up now.
"
2,1,126,Ted:,"Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!
"
2,1,127,Marshall:,"Hello?! (He hangs up) A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.
"
2,1,128,Barney:,"No!
"
2,1,129,Ted:,"Dude, you can't...
"
2,1,130,Marshall:,"I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.
"
2,1,131,Robin:,"Marshall, you can't do that!
"
2,1,132,Marshall:,"Really? Why not?
"
2,1,133,Ted from 2030:,"56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here.
"
2,1,134,Ted:,"Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?
"
2,1,135,Barney:,"Bold. Bold to go for the car.
"
2,1,136,Ted:,"What?
"
2,1,137,Robin:,"I didn't say a thing.
"
2,1,138,Ted:,"You think I was too hard on him.
"
2,1,139,Robin:,"I didn't say a thing.
"
2,1,140,Ted:,"I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.
"
2,1,141,Robin:,"Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.
"
2,1,142,Ted:,"Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut?
"
2,1,143,Robin:,"No, I'm a gun enthusiast.
"
2,1,144,Ted:,"Do you know how many people are killed...
"
2,1,145,Robin:,"The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...
"
2,1,146,Ted:,"Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.
"
2,1,147,Robin:,"A little.
"
2,1,148,Ted:,"I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing.
"
2,1,149,Barney:,"Barney.
"
2,1,150,Ted:,"Uh, hey. Where are you guys?
"
2,1,151,Barney:,"We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.
"
2,1,152,Ted:,"Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?
"
2,1,153,Barney:,"Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.
"
2,1,154,Stripper:,"Already?
"
2,1,155,Ted:,"What? What uh-oh?
"
2,1,156,Barney:,"He's gone.
"
2,1,157,Ted:,"You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.
"
2,1,158,Barney:,"Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!
"
2,1,159,Ted:,"Barney![End of the phone call]
"
2,1,160,Robin:,"Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place?
"
2,1,161,Ted:,"A really nice one.
"
2,1,162,Ted:,"Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall!
"
2,1,163,Marshall:,"Hey.
"
2,1,164,Ted:,"What happened?
"
2,1,165,Marshall:,"Well, I went up to Lily's floor...
"
2,1,166,Marshall:,"..and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. (A man is opening the door and Marshall is punching him in the face).
"
2,1,167,Ted:,"You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?
"
2,1,168,Marshall:,"Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.
"
2,1,169,Ted:,"What? Who was he?
"
2,1,170,Ted from 2030:,"His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer...
"
2,1,171,Lily:,"Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?
"
2,1,172,Waiter/Joey Adalian:,"Yes, I do.[End of flashback]
"
2,1,173,Ted:,"So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?
"
2,1,174,Marshall:,"Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.
"
2,1,175,Ted:,"You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.
"
2,1,176,Marshall:,"Ted.
"
2,1,177,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
2,1,178,Marshall:,"I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.
"
2,1,179,Ted:,"What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.
"
2,1,180,Marshall:,"OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.
"
2,1,181,Ted:,"Cheers.
"
2,1,182,"DAY FIFTY-SEVEN, at the apartment.Ted from 2030:","But it wasn't. 'cause that's no how life works. The next day he found one of her socks or something and we were back to square one. And then, one morning...
"
2,1,183,Robin:,"Ted. Ted you should see this.
"
2,1,184,Ted:,"Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing?
"
2,1,185,Marshall:,"It's Sunday. It's pancakes day.
"
2,1,186,Ted from 2030:,"It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
"
2,14,1,Ted (voix off):,"Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget.
"
2,14,2,Ted:,"Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.
"
2,14,3,Barney:,"""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.
"
2,14,4,Ted:,"And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.
"
2,14,5,Marshall:,"If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that.
"
2,14,6,The waitress:,"Here's the info for tomorrow night.
"
2,14,7,Ted:,"What's tomorrow night?
"
2,14,8,The waitress:,"Oh, God, you didn't hear? Mark died.
"
2,14,9,Lily:,"Oh, my God.
"
2,14,10,Marshall:,"Oh, my gosh.
"
2,14,11,The waitress:,"The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came. You guys were his favorite customers.
"
2,14,12,All:,"Stay strong. We're so sorry. (the waitress leaves)
"
2,14,13,Ted:,"Who was Mark?
"
2,14,14,Marshall:,"No idea.
"
2,14,15,Barney:,"Not a clue.
"
2,14,16,Lily:,"Well, I guess we should go, right?
"
2,14,17,Marshall:,"Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl.
"
2,14,18,Ted:,"Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.
"
2,14,19,Lily:,"Mark.
"
2,14,20,Ted:,"Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar): Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?
"
2,14,21,All:,"Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.
"
2,14,22,Ted:,"Okay, here's the plan: record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt...
"
2,14,23,Lily:,"Mark.
"
2,14,24,Ted:,"Mark, and start watching only an hour late.
"
2,14,25,Marshall:,"Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.
"
2,14,26,Ted:,"Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the
"
2,14,27,Marshall:,"Amen.
"
2,14,28,Ted:,"Amen.
"
2,14,29,Lily:,"We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.
"
2,14,30,Robin:,"Yeah, they're the best part.
"
2,14,31,Ted:,"Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?
"
2,14,32,Robin:,"Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.
"
2,14,33,Barney:,"Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy.
"
2,14,34,Ted:,"So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?
"
2,14,35,Barney:,"Have I taught you nothing, Ted?
"
2,14,36,Ted:,"Virtually.
"
2,14,37,Barney:,"Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.
"
2,14,38,Ted:,"Sartorial""?
"
2,14,39,Barney:,"""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!
"
2,14,40,Barney:,"Such a waste.
"
2,14,41,Lily:,"I know. He was so young.
"
2,14,42,Barney:,"A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened.
"
2,14,43,Robin:,"This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00.
"
2,14,44,Carl:,"And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.
"
2,14,45,Marshall:,"Dibs on the one Carl just told.
"
2,14,46,Robin:,"Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.
"
2,14,47,Lily:,"Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score.
"
2,14,48,Barney:,"Oh, thank God! I'll find out.
"
2,14,49,Ted:,"No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.
"
2,14,50,Ted:,"Second down, everyone drink.
"
2,14,51,Barney:,"Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens.
"
2,14,52,Marshall:,"Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things.
"
2,14,53,Ted:,"I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!
"
2,14,54,Marshall:,"Calm down, buddy.
"
2,14,55,Lily:,"Oh, commercials!
"
2,14,56,Ted:,"Everyone drink!
"
2,14,57,Ted:,"God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?
"
2,14,58,Marshall:,"Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.
"
2,14,59,Barney:,"I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.
"
2,14,60,Marshall:,"Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.
"
2,14,61,Barney:,"Fine.
"
2,14,62,Marshall:,"See, there you go, he made it. You win.
"
2,14,63,Barney:,"Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?
"
2,14,64,Marshall:,"Nothing, it's the halftime show.
"
2,14,65,Lily:,"Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?
"
2,14,66,Ted:,"God, how cool is Robin?
"
2,14,67,Marshall:,"I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.
"
2,14,68,Barney:,"Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.
"
2,14,69,Marshall:,"Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.
"
2,14,70,Barney:,"$50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.
"
2,14,71,Robin:,"Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.
"
2,14,72,Ted:,"Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.
"
2,14,73,Barney:,"That's impossible.
"
2,14,74,Ted:,"I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?
"
2,14,75,Lily:,"I'm in.
"
2,14,76,Robin:,"I'm in.
"
2,14,77,Marshall:,"I'm in.
"
2,14,78,Barney:,"What the hell, I'm in. High five!
"
2,14,79,Ted:,"Dude, we're at a wake.
"
2,14,80,Barney:,"Sorry. Solemn low five.
"
2,14,81,Ted (voix off):,"As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.
"
2,14,82,Barney:,"Hey, take this key and swallow it.
"
2,14,83,Ted:,"What? No.
"
2,14,84,Barney:,"Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.
"
2,14,85,Ted:,"Lots more, no.
"
2,14,86,Barney:,"I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.
"
2,14,87,Ted:,"Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.
"
2,14,88,Ted (voix off):,"The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.
"
2,14,89,Robin:,"But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.
"
2,14,90,Kevin:,"Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.
"
2,14,91,Man:,"You're right, Kevin.
"
2,14,92,Kevin:,"Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update.
"
2,14,93,Robin:,"No!
"
2,14,94,Kevin:,"What?
"
2,14,95,Robin:,"No.
"
2,14,96,Kevin:,"But it's, uh, time for Sports.
"
2,14,97,Robin:,"No, it's not. It's time for Weather.
"
2,14,98,Kevin:,"We, we just did Weather.
"
2,14,99,Robin:,"Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?
"
2,14,100,Lou:,"Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin.
"
2,14,101,Kevin:,"Okay, now it's time for Sports.
"
2,14,102,Robin:,"No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.
"
2,14,103,Kevin:,"Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid.
"
2,14,104,Sid:,"Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl.
"
2,14,105,Ted (voix off):,"Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.
"
2,14,106,Lily:,"And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.
"
2,14,107,Marshall:,"Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster.""
"
2,14,108,Lily:,"Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.
"
2,14,109,Doug:,"Hey. I'm Doug.
"
2,14,110,Marshall:,"Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.
"
2,14,111,Doug:,"Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?
"
2,14,112,Marshall:,"Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.
"
2,14,113,Doug:," I know who won.
"
2,14,114,Marshall:,"Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.
"
2,14,115,Doug:,"How badly do you not want to know?
"
2,14,116,Marshall:,"Excuse me?
"
2,14,117,Doug:,"Ten bucks.
"
2,14,118,Marshall:,"Are you serious?
"
2,14,119,Doug:,"Just went up to eight.
"
2,14,120,Barney:,"Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.
"
2,14,121,Ted:,"Not until game time.
"
2,14,122,Barney:,"Where are you going?
"
2,14,123,Ted:,"Pick up the hot wings.
"
2,14,124,Barney:,"What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.
"
2,14,125,Ted:,"Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
"
2,14,126,Ted:,"Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!
"
2,14,127,Sid:,"And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin.
"
2,14,128,Kevin:,"We'll be right back.
"
2,14,129,Man:,"And we're clear.
"
2,14,130,Robin:,"I'm sorry.
"
2,14,131,Woman:,"Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?
"
2,14,132,Robin:,"I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.
"
2,14,133,Woman:,"That is crazy. I can't do that.
"
2,14,134,Robin:,"My friend Mark passed away this week.
"
2,14,135,Woman:,"Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.
"
2,14,136,Man:,"Back in five... four... three...
"
2,14,137,Robin:,"It's just so hard.
"
2,14,138,Ted:,"Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...!
"
2,14,139,Ted (voix off):,"And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.
"
2,14,140,Ted:,"Where's the dipping sauce?
"
2,14,141,Doug:,"The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?
"
2,14,142,Marshall:,"Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?
"
2,14,143,Doug:,"I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.
"
2,14,144,Marshall:,"Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.
"
2,14,145,Lily:,"Okay, now who did this?
"
2,14,146,Marshall:,"I did.
"
2,14,147,Doug:,"Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?
"
2,14,148,Lily:,"Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...
"
2,14,149,Doug:,"When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.
"
2,14,150,Lily:,"Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.
"
2,14,151,Robin:,"And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.
"
2,14,152,Doug:,"Hey. Hey.
"
2,14,153,Marshall:,"I'm not talking to you.
"
2,14,154,Doug:,"Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath.
"
2,14,155,Marshall:,"I'm not holding my breath.
"
2,14,156,Doug:,"The winning team was the... (Marshall holds his breath) Now here's how this is going to work: you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...
"
2,14,157,Ted (voix off):,"And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times...
"
2,14,158,Marshall:,"Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.
"
2,14,159,Doug:,"No, I didn't.
"
2,14,160,Marshall:,"Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question: You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone...
"
2,14,161,Doug:,"Okay, okay. You win.
"
2,14,162,Marshall:,"I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.
"
2,14,163,Barney:,"Sir, who won the Super Bowl?
"
2,14,164,Man:,"Sorry. I missed the game.
"
2,14,165,Barney:,"You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!
"
2,14,166,Man 2:,"I... don't really follow sports.
"
2,14,167,Barney:,"Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.
"
2,14,168,Emmitt Smith:,"Yeah, I get that a lot.
"
2,14,169,Barney:,"You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?
"
2,14,170,Emmitt Smith:,"The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.
"
2,14,171,Barney:,"But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!
"
2,14,172,Emmitt Smith:,"Dance, my friend. Dance.
"
2,14,173,Barney:,"No...!
"
2,14,174,Ted:,"Hello! It's me again.
"
2,14,175,Barman:,"Oh! I didn't recognize you.
"
2,14,176,Ted:,"Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.
"
2,14,177,Ted (voix off):,"It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong.
"
2,14,178,Robin:,"And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.
"
2,14,179,Man 1:,"Hey, buddy.
"
2,14,180,Man 2:,"Hey, dude, look out.
"
2,14,181,Trish Sanchez:,"And in honor of yesterday's big win...
"
2,14,182,Man 1:,"Hey, buddy, look out.
"
2,14,183,Man 2:,"Dude, watch out!
"
2,14,184,Trish Sanchez:,"...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions...
"
2,14,185,Robin:,"No...!
"
2,14,186,Marshall (at school):,"No...!
"
2,14,187,Barney (tearing the newspaper):,"No...!
"
2,14,188,Ted:,"Yes...!
"
2,14,189,Ted:,"Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?
"
2,14,190,Robin:,"Mission accomplished.
"
2,14,191,Lily:,"Didn't find out.
"
2,14,192,Ted:,"Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Barney comes in) Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.
"
2,14,193,Ted:,"Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.
"
2,14,194,Ted:,"Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.
"
2,14,195,Lily:,"Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.
"
2,14,196,Robin:,"Way to blow it.
"
2,14,197,Marshall:,"Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.
"
2,14,198,Ted:,"There's no point in even watching the game.
"
2,14,199,Lily:,"Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.
"
2,14,200,Marshall:,"Wings are still good.
"
2,14,201,Robin:,"Beer still works.
"
2,14,202,Ted:,"Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money.
"
2,14,203,Marshall:,"Hey, so check this out: I got extorted by a five-year-old today.
"
2,14,204,Robin:,"I almost got fired today.
"
2,14,205,Barney:,"I met Emmitt Smith today.
"
2,14,206,Lily:,"Ooh, you go first.
"
2,14,207,Ted:,"I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
"
2,14,208,Lily:,"Yeah, go ahead, Barney.
"
2,14,209,Barney:,"Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...
"
2,14,210,Ted (voix off):,"And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?
"
2,14,211,Barney:,"I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?
"
2,14,212,Ted:,"50-50, give or take.
"
2,14,213,Barney:,"Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...
"
2,2,1,Ted from 2030:,"Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward.
"
2,2,2,Robin:,"Alright, see you guys later.
"
2,2,3,Ted:,"I'll walk you out.
"
2,2,4,Marshall:,"See ya.
"
2,2,5,Barney:,"You just checked out Robin's ass.
"
2,2,6,Marshall:,"What? No. I... Barney, I was...
"
2,2,7,Barney:,"Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead.
"
2,2,8,Marshall:,"Lily.
"
2,2,9,Barney:,"Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass.
"
2,2,10,Marshall:,"I did not Ted...
"
2,2,11,Ted:,"Awesome! You're finally getting better.
"
2,2,12,Barney:,"This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in.
"
2,2,13,Ted:,"Yes!
"
2,2,14,Marshall:,"Oh, God!
"
2,2,15,Barney:,"Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?
"
2,2,16,Marshall:,"Candy.
"
2,2,17,Barney:,"Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?
"
2,2,18,Ted:,"Mounds.
"
2,2,19,Barney:,"Milk Duds.
"
2,2,20,Ted:,"Gobstoppers.
"
2,2,21,Barney:,"Um...
"
2,2,22,Ted from 2030:,"This went on for another hour. I'll just skip to the end.
"
2,2,23,Ted:,"Dubble Bubbles.
"
2,2,24,Barney:,"Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer.
"
2,2,25,Marshall:,"Fine.
"
2,2,26,Ted (on the phone):,"Hey Robin. Marshall checked out your ass.
"
2,2,27,Marshall:,"Ted, what is wrong with you?
"
2,2,28,Robin (on the phone):,"He checked out my ass? Hey, tell him thanks. I felt like I was having a bad ass day. Cool. See ya.
"
2,2,29,Robin:,"Lily.
"
2,2,30,Lily:,"It is a great ass.
"
2,2,31,Ted from 2030:,"None of us had seen Lily in three months. There were so many unanswered questions, so many things to say.
"
2,2,32,Robin:,"Your hair is adorable!
"
2,2,33,Lily:,"Thank you! (They hug)
"
2,2,34,At MacLaren's.Ted from 2030:,"Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17.
"
2,2,35,Barney:,"Hi. Have you met Marshall?
"
2,2,36,Woman:,"Hi.
"
2,2,37,Marshall:,"Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you.
"
2,2,38,Barney:,"I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?
"
2,2,39,Woman:,"Umm... I guess. (Barney makes a trick, Umm, I guess is writing on his hand). Oh my God! (Barney does it again, Oh my God! appears on his hand) Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!
"
2,2,40,Barney:,"Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl.
"
2,2,41,Marshall:,"You went home with her!
"
2,2,42,Barney:,"Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...
"
2,2,43,Marshall:,"Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.
"
2,2,44,Barney:,"Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!
"
2,2,45,Marshall:,"Oh, really?
"
2,2,46,Barney:,"My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night.
"
2,2,47,Marshall:,"Oh, come on. Does that really work?
"
2,2,48,Barney:,"Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.
"
2,2,49,Marshall:,"Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in.
"
2,2,50,Robin:,"You've gotta hear this.
"
2,2,51,Ted:,"You will not believe what just happened.
"
2,2,52,Robin:,"You go first.
"
2,2,53,Ted:,"I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...
"
2,2,54,Robin:,"Lily is back in town.
"
2,2,55,Ted:,"And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?
"
2,2,56,Robin:,"Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today.
"
2,2,57,Ted:,"How is she doing?
"
2,2,58,Robin:,"You're not gonna like it.
"
2,2,59,Lily:,"I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now.
"
2,2,60,Ted:,"She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.
"
2,2,61,Lily:,"Oh, the art program, best thing ever.
"
2,2,62,Man:,"Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. (The man is giving Lily his paintbrush).
"
2,2,63,Lily:,"But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry.
"
2,2,64,"In San Francisco, in a bus.Man 1:","Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.
"
2,2,65,Woman:,"I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah!
"
2,2,66,Man 2:,"I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way.
"
2,2,67,Robin:,"Wow, I am so happy for you.
"
2,2,68,Ted:,"Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.
"
2,2,69,Robin:,"You never chose sides. I respect that.
"
2,2,70,Ted:,"She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!
"
2,2,71,Marshall:,"Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?
"
2,2,72,Ted:,"Uh, listen Marshall...
"
2,2,73,Robin:,"Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.
"
2,2,74,Marshall:,"Way to go.
"
2,2,75,Ted:,"OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.
"
2,2,76,Robin:,"No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?
"
2,2,77,Ted:,"She's moved on?
"
2,2,78,Robin:,"Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?
"
2,2,79,Barney:,"Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five.
"
2,2,80,Marshall:,"Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.
"
2,2,81,Barney:,"Excellent. Have you chosen your entr√©e?
"
2,2,82,Marshall:,"I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.
"
2,2,83,Barney:,"Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it.
"
2,2,84,Marshall (to the girl):,"Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall.
"
2,2,85,Girl:,"Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on.
"
2,2,86,Barney:,"Nice recovery. I think it's working.
"
2,2,87,Marshall:,"Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy.
"
2,2,88,Amy:,"Hey Barney, nice to meet you.
"
2,2,89,Barney:,"Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?
"
2,2,90,Marshall:,"I hate you.
"
2,2,91,Barney:,"I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here.
"
2,2,92,Marshall:,"Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!
"
2,2,93,Barney:,"I know but tonight...
"
2,2,94,Marshall:,"No, forget it. You're such a jackass!
"
2,2,95,Barney (with you're a jerk writing on his hand):,"I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion & The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter.
"
2,2,96,Marshall:,"OK, but no magic. (He turns to Barney who disappeared). How did you do that?
"
2,2,97,Barney:,"I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.
"
2,2,98,In a building.Ted from 2030:,"Robin and I went apartment hunting with Aunt Lily.
"
2,2,99,Lily:,"But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing.
"
2,2,100,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
2,2,101,Lily:,"It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.
"
2,2,102,Robin:,"What?
"
2,2,103,Ted:,"She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!
"
2,2,104,Robin:,"No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy.
"
2,2,105,Ted:,"Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.
"
2,2,106,Robin:,"Trust me, I'm a girl!
"
2,2,107,Ted:,"Yeah. But you're Canadian.
"
2,2,108,Robin:,"Why do you always have to bring that up?
"
2,2,109,Ted:,"You're our weird neighbors!
"
2,2,110,Robin:,"You bring it up every time...
"
2,2,111,Ted:,"No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.
"
2,2,112,Robin:,"You're on.
"
2,2,113,Ted:,"Five American bucks.
"
2,2,114,Robin:,"Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?
"
2,2,115,Ted:,"Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.
"
2,2,116,(Lily come back.)Lily:,"I hope this is my new home. (She comes in the apartment) Yeah, I'm gonna take that first apartment.
"
2,2,117,Barney:,"Marshall Eriksen, suit up!
"
2,2,118,Marshall:,"No way.
"
2,2,119,Barney:,"Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.
"
2,2,120,Marshall:,"Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.
"
2,2,121,Barney:,"Come on...
"
2,2,122,Marshall:,"Sleeves.
"
2,2,123,Barney:,"There is nothing in my sl...
"
2,2,124,Marshall:,"Oh is that right?
"
2,2,125,Barney:,"Huh? Huh? Let's go.
"
2,2,126,Marshall:,"Behind my ear.
"
2,2,127,Barney:,"Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!
"
2,2,128,Marshall:,"Ohh!
"
2,2,129,Girl:,"Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's killing me though.
"
2,2,130,Marshall:,"Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does kill you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.
"
2,2,131,In an other spot of the Scorpion & the Toad.Barney (to a girl):,"You must be majoring in chemistry 'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh... (The girl leaves / to the girl's friend) College lesbian phase.
"
2,2,132,Girl:,"Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again.
"
2,2,133,Marshall:,"Yes, it would. It really would.
"
2,2,134,Girl:,"Maybe I'll see you here sometimes.
"
2,2,135,Marshall:,"Probably not. I'm never here, so...
"
2,2,136,Girl:,"You know, I do have a phone number.
"
2,2,137,Marshall:,"Great. Nice.
"
2,2,138,Barney:,"Hi, I'm Barney.
"
2,2,139,Marshall:,"Oh, no.
"
2,2,140,Barney:,"Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?
"
2,2,141,Girl:,"Sure.
"
2,2,142,Marshall:,"Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?
"
2,2,143,Barney:,"Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.
"
2,2,144,Marshall (choking Barney):,"I'll kill you!
"
2,2,145,Lily:,"And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?
"
2,2,146,Marshall:,"Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...
"
2,2,147,Barney:,"I'm not giving you...
"
2,2,148,Ted:,"Terrific.
"
2,2,149,Lily:,"That is so good to hear. (Lily's phone rings). Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. (She leaves the room).
"
2,2,150,Ted:,"OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.
"
2,2,151,Lily:,"I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. (She starts crying).
"
2,2,152,Ted:,"Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?
"
2,2,153,Robin:,"No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.
"
2,2,154,Lily:,"The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! (Robin gives back Ted his five dollars)
"
2,2,155,Barney:,"Stop it!
"
2,2,156,Marshall:,"You don't want to see me when I'm angry!
"
2,2,157,Barney:,"Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. (He sends the card across the window).
"
2,2,158,Marshall:,"Stop the cab! (Marshall gets out of the car)
"
2,2,159,Barney:,"No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. (He pulls the card out of his sleeve). Oh, she does have a cute handwriting.
"
2,2,160,In a snack-bar.Ted from 2030:,"About hangovers - everyone has their own special remedy.
"
2,2,161,Waiter:,"Morning guys, what can I get you?
"
2,2,162,Lily:,"Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake.
"
2,2,163,Waiter:,"For you, sir?
"
2,2,164,Ted:,"Gravy.
"
2,2,165,Waiter:,"You want that gravy on something?
"
2,2,166,Ted:,"Surprise me.
"
2,2,167,Robin:,"I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.
"
2,2,168,Lily:,"What are you charpy about?
"
2,2,169,Ted:,"She's still drunk from last night.
"
2,2,170,Robin:,"I don't think so! Whoo!
"
2,2,171,Ted:,"Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?
"
2,2,172,Lily:,"I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...
"
2,2,173,Robin:,"But it's good, I mean work's great...
"
2,2,174,Lily:,"Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now? (They are now with Ted in an other building) Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask! (Then, the three of them are in Robin's apartment) And, hey, how is Marshall?
"
2,2,175,Lily:,"It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.
"
2,2,176,Ted:,"But I thought your summer was great?!
"
2,2,177,Lily:,"Not exactly...
"
2,2,178,Man:,"Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything.
"
2,2,179,Ted:,"So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?
"
2,2,180,Lily:,"Yeah, um...
"
2,2,181,Man:,"I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.
"
2,2,182,Lily:,"I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?
"
2,2,183,Ted:,"In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.
"
2,2,184,Lily:,"Wow. So, maybe I should call him?
"
2,2,185,Ted:,"Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word ""maybe"". ""Maybe"" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.
"
2,2,186,Robin (laughing):,"This guy like pennies!
"
2,2,187,Barney:,"Hi Marshall.
"
2,2,188,Marshall:,"No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.
"
2,2,189,Barney:,"OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you.
"
2,2,190,Marshall:,"There is no ""would"" in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.
"
2,2,191,Barney:,"You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.
"
2,2,192,Marshall:,"That's not possible.
"
2,2,193,Barney:,"Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!
"
2,2,194,Marshall:,"A twin isn't the same person.
"
2,2,195,Barney:,"Of course, it is. What do you think ""identical"" means? ""Ident-"" - same. ""-ical"" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.
"
2,2,196,Marshall:,"Fine.
"
2,2,197,Barney:,"Ah!
"
2,2,198,Marshall:,"But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.
"
2,2,199,Barney:,"Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.
"
2,2,200,Ted from 2030:,"So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.
"
2,2,201,Barney:,"How are you doing?
"
2,2,202,Marshall:,"Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.
"
2,2,203,Barney:,"You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.
"
2,2,204,Marshall:,"It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.
"
2,2,205,Barney:,"But they're twins.
"
2,2,206,Marshall:,"You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.
"
2,2,207,Barney:,"Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...
"
2,2,208,Marshall:,"Ted's my best friend.
"
2,2,209,Barney:,"..but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. (Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar). Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.
"
2,2,210,Twin 1:,"What?
"
2,2,211,Twin 2:,"That's so bad. I really liked him.
"
2,2,212,Barney:,"Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.
"
2,2,213,Marshall:,"Lily. What are you doing here?
"
2,2,214,Lily:,"Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.
"
2,2,215,Marshall:,"Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.
"
2,2,216,Lily:,"I know. It was the worst summer of my life.
"
2,2,217,Marshall:,"It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.
"
2,2,218,Lily:,"Can we please get back together?
"
2,2,219,Marshall:,"All that crap you said to me about ""we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own."". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.
"
2,2,220,Lily:,"Can we please get back together?
"
2,2,221,Marshall:,"Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.
"
2,2,222,Lily:,"Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?
"
2,2,223,Marshall:,"Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.
"
2,2,224,Lily:,"Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. (Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later). And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.
"
2,2,225,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
2,2,226,Lily:,"Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.
"
2,2,227,Marshall:,"Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.
"
2,2,228,Barney:,"So then, I was promoted to assistant m√©nage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? (Lily arrives.) Lily?
"
2,2,229,Lily:,"You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! (She throws a drink at his face and leaves)
"
2,2,230,Barney:,"So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant m√©nage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!
"
2,2,231,Lily:,"You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! (She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins).
"
2,2,232,Barney:,"Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played.
"
2,16,1,Ted (voix off):,"Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk.
"
2,16,2,Robin:,"How about Mimi's?
"
2,16,3,Ted:,"Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.
"
2,16,4,Robin:,"Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.
"
2,16,5,Ted:,"Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?
"
2,16,6,Robin:,"We did?
"
2,16,7,Ted:,"Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!""
"
2,16,8,Ted (voix off):,"It's also important to know when to stop talking.
"
2,16,9,Ted:,"Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?
"
2,16,10,Robin:,"Because it wasn't me.
"
2,16,11,Ted:,"Oh, right! It was... my sister.
"
2,16,12,Ted (voix off):,"You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.
"
2,16,13,Ted:,"Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.
"
2,16,14,Robin:,"I've never seen Van Helsing.
"
2,16,15,Ted:," That's right. I saw it with my sister.
"
2,16,16,Robin:,"My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.
"
2,16,17,Ted:,"Oh, it's so romantic.
"
2,16,18,Robin:,"When were you in Maui?
"
2,16,19,Ted:,"I... went... with my sister.
"
2,16,20,Robin:,"With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.
"
2,16,21,Ted:,"You're right. We should just be honest.
"
2,16,22,Robin:,"Totally.
"
2,16,23,Ted:,"See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.
"
2,16,24,Robin:,"I don't want to hear that.
"
2,16,25,Ted:,"What? You said...
"
2,16,26,Robin:,"God, that is so insensitive.
"
2,16,27,Ted:,"Remember honesty...?
"
2,16,28,Robin:,"You're a jerk!
"
2,16,29,Ted:,"Well, you're...confusing.
"
2,16,30,Marshall:,"Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!
"
2,16,31,Barney:,"I don't know. Is she fat?
"
2,16,32,Marshall:,"Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.
"
2,16,33,Lily:,"Hot off the presses!
"
2,16,34,Barney:,"I-I don't take flyers.
"
2,16,35,Marshall:,"You took one two seconds before you walked in here.
"
2,16,36,Barney:,"That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?
"
2,16,37,Lily:,"Fine. It's a flyer from my play.
"
2,16,38,Barney:,"Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...
"
2,16,39,Marshall:,"Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.
"
2,16,40,Barney:,"Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.
"
2,16,41,Ted:,"Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.
"
2,16,42,Barney:,"Yes, you should break up.
"
2,16,43,Ted:,"So, earlier tonight...
"
2,16,44,Robin:,"Mm, we should get down to the bar.
"
2,16,45,Ted:,"I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.
"
2,16,46,Barney:,"Oh, God, why is this part of the story?
"
2,16,47,Ted:,"We're getting to it.
"
2,16,48,Robin:,"Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?
"
2,16,49,Ted:,"Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.
"
2,16,50,Lily:,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
"
2,16,51,Barney:,"What's wrong with her?
"
2,16,52,Marshall:,"She hates that word.
"
2,16,53,Barney:,"What word, ""moist""?
"
2,16,54,Lily:,"No! Seriously, stop!
"
2,16,55,Robin:,"So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...
"
2,16,56,Robin:,"Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.
"
2,16,57,Ted:,"What are you talking about? It's yours.
"
2,16,58,Robin:,"No, it's not.
"
2,16,59,Ted:,"Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.
"
2,16,60,Lily:,"No, it's not.
"
2,16,61,Robin:,"Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?
"
2,16,62,Ted:,"Um, my sister's.
"
2,16,63,Robin:,"So, in other words, some girl you went out with.
"
2,16,64,Ted:,"Um... I love you.
"
2,16,65,Robin:,"Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?
"
2,16,66,Lily:,"It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.
"
2,16,67,Marshall:,"I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.
"
2,16,68,Ted:,"Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.
"
2,16,69,Robin:,"Why is that still in your apartment?
"
2,16,70,Ted:,"I don't know. I just never threw it out.
"
2,16,71,Robin:,"Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?
"
2,16,72,Ted:,"Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.
"
2,16,73,Robin:,"Not three dollars! Try 14.
"
2,16,74,Ted:,"Why is this such a big deal?
"
2,16,75,Robin:,"Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!
"
2,16,76,Ted:,"Whoa, she wasn't a whore.
"
2,16,77,Robin:,"Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?
"
2,16,78,Ted:,"Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...
"
2,16,79,Robin:,"No. No! No! Oh, Ted!
"
2,16,80,Lily:,"Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?
"
2,16,81,Robin:,"Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.
"
2,16,82,Ted:,"Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.
"
2,16,83,Robin:,"So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.
"
2,16,84,Ted:,"Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.
"
2,16,85,Barney:,"Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.
"
2,16,86,Marshall:,"Nice, right?
"
2,16,87,Robin:,"I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old
"
2,16,88,Lily:,"Yes!
"
2,16,89,Barney:,"I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker.
"
2,16,90,Marshall:,"Ted. Ted? Ted?
"
2,16,91,Ted:,"Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.
"
2,16,92,Marshall:,"They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.
"
2,16,93,Barney:,"Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.
"
2,16,94,Lily:,"All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.
"
2,16,95,Ted:,"Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.
"
2,16,96,Marshall:,"Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.
"
2,16,97,Robin:,"Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.
"
2,16,98,Ex-girlfriend 1:,"I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?
"
2,16,99,Ex-girlfriend 2:,"He calls you ""sweetie pie""? He called me ""sweetie pie.""
"
2,16,100,Ex-girlfriend 3:,"I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.
"
2,16,101,Ted:,"Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!
"
2,16,102,Robin:,"Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.
"
2,16,103,Ted:,"You're creepy and gross.
"
2,16,104,Robin:,"Your mom's creepy and gross.
"
2,16,105,Lily:,"Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.
"
2,16,106,Marshall:,"I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.
"
2,16,107,Ted:,"All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.
"
2,16,108,Barney:,"I side with Robin.
"
2,16,109,Ted:,"What?
"
2,16,110,Barney:,"Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.
"
2,16,111,Robin:,"Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?
"
2,16,112,Ted:,"Just stop, sweetie.
"
2,16,113,Ted (voix off):,"So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.
"
2,16,114,Robin:,"Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?
"
2,16,115,Barney:,"From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.
"
2,16,116,Ted:,"Where do you guys want to sit?
"
2,16,117,Barney:,"I know where I don't want to sit.
"
2,16,118,Marshall (in the front row):,"Guys, four together!
"
2,16,119,Barney:,"I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.
"
2,16,120,Robin:,"Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.
"
2,16,121,Barney:,"No? Okay.
"
2,16,122,Man 1:,"I... am... Rage!
"
2,16,123,Woman:,"I... am Greed.
"
2,16,124,Lily:,"I am Rage... Envy!
"
2,16,125,Barney:,"I am outta here.
"
2,16,126,Marshall:,"No, you're not. You have to stay.
"
2,16,127,Lily:,"This is the face of Consumerism!
"
2,16,128,Marshall:,"Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.
"
2,16,129,Man 2:,"Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!
"
2,16,130,Marshall:,"Oh, baby, that was wonderful!
"
2,16,131,Ted:,"Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.
"
2,16,132,Robin:,"And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!""
"
2,16,133,Barney:,"Wow, Lily, that sucked!
"
2,16,134,Marshall:,"Barney!
"
2,16,135,Barney:,"What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.
"
2,16,136,Lily:,"No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.
"
2,16,137,Barney:,"Yeah, if you're a Smurf.
"
2,16,138,Lily:,"You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.
"
2,16,139,Barney:,"Oh, really? You would?
"
2,16,140,Lily:,"Yes.
"
2,16,141,Barney:,"Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.
"
2,16,142,Man:,"We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out
"
2,16,143,Robin:,"Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?
"
2,16,144,Ted:,"I know. He can be really insensitive.
"
2,16,145,Robin:,"It was pretty bad, though.
"
2,16,146,Ted:,"Oh, my God, it was so bad.
"
2,16,147,Robin:,"Oh, my God, you've been robbed!
"
2,16,148,Ted:,"Nope.
"
2,16,149,Robin:,"All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?
"
2,16,150,Ted:,"What can I say? Papa gets swag.
"
2,16,151,Ted (voix off):,"And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...
"
2,16,152,Ted:,"You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.
"
2,16,153,Robin:,"Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.
"
2,16,154,Ted:,"Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?
"
2,16,155,Robin:,"Nope. Well, except for my dogs.
"
2,16,156,Ted:,"So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships.
"
2,16,157,Robin:,"What's your point, Ted?
"
2,16,158,Ted:,"Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?
"
2,16,159,Robin:,"What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?
"
2,16,160,Ted:,"I do now.
"
2,16,161,Robin:,"That's ridiculous.
"
2,16,162,Ted:,"I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.
"
2,16,163,Ted:,"You said everything.
"
2,16,164,Robin:,"But not living things.
"
2,16,165,Ted:,"Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.
"
2,16,166,Robin:,"Things with a heartbeat can stay.
"
2,16,167,Ted:,"Enjoying this?
"
2,16,168,Robin:,"Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.
"
2,16,169,Ted:,"Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.
"
2,16,170,Robin:,"Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?
"
2,16,171,Man:,"Guess what position we did it in.
"
2,16,172,Ted:,"Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.
"
2,16,173,Robin:,"Um, no.
"
2,16,174,Ted:,"Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.
"
2,16,175,Marshall:,"She's not getting rid of the dogs.
"
2,16,176,Lily:,"What's the matter with you?
"
2,16,177,Barney:,"Even I wouldn't do that.
"
2,16,178,Robin:,"Yes!
"
2,16,179,Lily:,"You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.
"
2,16,180,Marshall:,"I miss Jebediah.
"
2,16,181,Barney:,"Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.
"
2,16,182,Lily:,"Very funny.
"
2,16,183,Barney:,"Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.
"
2,16,184,Lily:,"Oh, we'll be there.
"
2,16,185,Barney:,"Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...
"
2,16,186,Lily:,"Never.
"
2,16,187,Barney:,"Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.
"
2,16,188,Robin:,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.
"
2,16,189,Ted:,"I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.
"
2,16,190,Robin:,"So we're-we're okay?
"
2,16,191,Ted:,"Yeah, we're great.
"
2,16,192,Ted (voix off):,"And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.
"
2,16,193,Man:,"Oh, yeah, that's the spot.
"
2,16,194,Man:,"Dude, I gotta pee.
"
2,16,195,Ted:,"I gotta go.
"
2,16,196,Lily:,"Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?
"
2,16,197,Robin:,"Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.
"
2,16,198,Lily:,"You're gonna kill your dogs?!
"
2,16,199,Robin:,"No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.
"
2,16,200,Lily:,"Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.
"
2,16,201,Robin:,"Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.
"
2,16,202,Lily:,"Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.
"
2,16,203,Robin:,"""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?
"
2,16,204,Lily:,"Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!
"
2,16,205,Marshall:,"Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...
"
2,16,206,Lily:,"I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.
"
2,16,207,Barney:,"Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.
"
2,16,208,Ted (voix off):,"That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.
"
2,16,209,Barney:,"Moist.
"
2,16,210,Ted (voix off):,"And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.
"
2,16,211,Barney:,"I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.
"
2,16,212,Marshall:,"I never get picked for audience participation.
"
2,16,213,Ted (voix off):,"And then it just got weird.
"
2,16,214,Barney:,"Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!
"
2,16,215,Ted (voix off):,"And when that didn't work...
"
2,16,216,Lily:,"Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.
"
2,16,217,Barney:,"Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?
"
2,16,218,Lily:,"No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.
"
2,16,219,Barney:,"Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting
"
2,16,220,Lily:,"Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.
"
2,16,221,Barney:,"Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.
"
2,16,222,Lily:,"Yeah, well, anyway.
"
2,16,223,Barney:,"Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?
"
2,16,224,Barney:,"It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.
"
2,16,225,Ted (voix off):,"So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.
"
2,16,226,Robin:,"Hey.
"
2,16,227,Ted:,"Where've you been? I called you earlier.
"
2,16,228,Robin:,"I gave my dogs away to my aunt.
"
2,16,229,Ted:,"You what?
"
2,16,230,Robin:,"Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.
"
2,16,231,Ted:,"Wow. Oh, man.
"
2,16,232,Robin:,"Can we go inside?
"
2,16,233,Ted:,"Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.
"
2,16,234,Robin:,"Why? What's going on inside?
"
2,16,235,Ted:,"Um, the floors are gone.
"
2,16,236,Robin:,"What?
"
2,16,237,Ted:,"Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.
"
2,16,238,Ted:,"I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!
"
2,16,239,Robin:,"You said you threw all that stuff away!
"
2,16,240,Ted (voix off):,"Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.
"
2,16,241,Robin:,"We're really doing this?
"
2,16,242,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
2,16,243,Ted and Robin:,"We're moving in together!
"
2,16,244,Barney:,"The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.
"
2,16,245,Marshall:,"That's two.
"
2,17,1,Ted:,"This is awesome.
"
2,17,2,Marshall:,"I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.
"
2,17,3,Ted:,"Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.
"
2,17,4,Marshall:,"Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.
"
2,17,5,Ted:,"Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.
"
2,17,6,Marshal:,"What are you talking about?
"
2,17,7,Ted:,"Whoa, pothole. The car stops.
"
2,17,8,Marshall:,"What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!
"
2,17,9,Ted:,"Is it cool if I still light these?
"
2,17,10,Ted (voix off):,"Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.
"
2,17,11,Ted:,"Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.
"
2,17,12,Marshall:,"Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.
"
2,17,13,Ted:,"Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.
"
2,17,14,Lily:,"Surprise.
"
2,17,15,Robin:,"We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.
"
2,17,16,Barney:,"We insisted.
"
2,17,17,Ted:,"Terrific.
"
2,17,18,Barney:,"How's the Fiero?
"
2,17,19,Marshall:,"She's still in triage.
"
2,17,20,Ted:,"She? I thought it was your little boy.
"
2,17,21,Lily:,"Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car.
"
2,17,22,Robin:,"How long have you had her... slash him?
"
2,17,23,Marshall:,"My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.
"
2,17,24,Robin:,"Oh, how nice of them.
"
2,17,25,Marshall:,"Not really.
"
2,17,26,Brother 1:,"Congratulations.
"
2,17,27,Brother 2:,"The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test.
"
2,17,28,Marshall:,"Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out.
"
2,17,29,Brother 1:,"Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee.
"
2,17,30,Marshall:,"That's it?
"
2,17,31,Brother 2:,"Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear.
"
2,17,32,Marshall:,"Agreed. Totally agreed.
"
2,17,33,Man:,"You're naked.
"
2,17,34,Marshall:,"I'm aware of that.
"
2,17,35,Man:,"You have 50 cents?
"
2,17,36,Marshall:,"No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?
"
2,17,37,Man:,"Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.
"
2,17,38,Ted:,"And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule.
"
2,17,39,Marshall:,"It is not insane.
"
2,17,40,Lily:,"Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.
"
2,17,41,Barney:,"Well, I'm trying, but it's...
"
2,17,42,Lily:,"Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?
"
2,17,43,Barney:,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.
"
2,17,44,Lily:,"No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.
"
2,17,45,Barney:,"Aw, nerts.
"
2,17,46,Ted:,"The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?
"
2,17,47,Marshall:,"Ah, the Fiero-asco.
"
2,17,48,Ted:,"Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.
"
2,17,49,Robin:,"What's the 100K fiasco?
"
2,17,50,Marshall:,"The Fiero-asco?
"
2,17,51,Ted:,"It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.
"
2,17,52,Marshall:,"I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.
"
2,17,53,Ted:,"And Marshall was a total slob.
"
2,17,54,Marshall:,"Hey (Marshall throws a sandwich in the trash but misses it) I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.
"
2,17,55,Ted:,"All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...
"
2,17,56,Marshall:,"All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.
"
2,17,57,Ted:,"She'd be so bummed if I left early.
"
2,17,58,Ted:,"It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.
"
2,17,59,Marshall:,"I hear you.
"
2,17,60,Ted:,"So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious
"
2,17,61,Marshall:,"Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?
"
2,17,62,Ted(voix off):,"The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.
"
2,17,63,Ted:,"So... this song.
"
2,17,64,Marshall:,"Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.
"
2,17,65,Ted:,"Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.
"
2,17,66,Marshall:,"Don't worry. It comes around again.
"
2,17,67,Ted:,"What do you mean?
"
2,17,68,Ted and Marshall singing:,"Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door...
"
2,17,69,Marshall:,"Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.
"
2,17,70,Ted:,"That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?
"
2,17,71,Marshall:,"What?
"
2,17,72,Ted:,"Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so...
"
2,17,73,Marshall:,"Zitch dog.
"
2,17,74,Ted:,"Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.
"
2,17,75,Marshall:,"Zitch dog.
"
2,17,76,Ted:,"Zitch dog. Damn it!
"
2,17,77,Ted:,"Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...
"
2,17,78,Marshall:,"12-nothing.
"
2,17,79,Ted:,"Marshall. Marshall.
"
2,17,80,Marshall:,"Zitch dog, blue Suburban.
"
2,17,81,Ted:,"Damn it!
"
2,17,82,Marshall:,"18-nothing.
"
2,17,83,Ted (voix off):,"Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.
"
2,17,84,Marshall:,"Where the hell are we?!
"
2,17,85,Marshall:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.
"
2,17,86,Barney:,"Really? Seems impossible.
"
2,17,87,Ted:,"Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.
"
2,17,88,Marshall:,"Doesn't seem like a smart idea.
"
2,17,89,Ted:,"Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?
"
2,17,90,Marshall:,"Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.
"
2,17,91,Ted:,"No, keep driving.
"
2,17,92,Marshall:,"We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.
"
2,17,93,Ted:,"It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.
"
2,17,94,Marshall:,"Nah, I threw them out.
"
2,17,95,Ted:,"What?!
"
2,17,96,Marshall:,"No food or drink in the Fiero.
"
2,17,97,Ted:,"No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... (Voix off): Thus began the longest night of our lives.
"
2,17,98,Marshall:,"Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.
"
2,17,99,Ted:,"Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.
"
2,17,100,Marshall:,"Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.
"
2,17,101,Ted:,"What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.
"
2,17,102,Marshall:,"Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.
"
2,17,103,Ted:,"But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.
"
2,17,104,Marshall:,"Wasn't an easy decision.
"
2,17,105,Ted:,"This is all because of your insane no-food rule.
"
2,17,106,Marshall:,"It's perfectly rational.
"
2,17,107,Ted:,"Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?
"
2,17,108,Marshall:,"Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.(they're both in the back seat in each other arms) We should've kept driving.
"
2,17,109,Ted:,"Come on, Marshall.
"
2,17,110,Marshall:,"No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.
"
2,17,111,Ted:,"That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.
"
2,17,112,Marshall:,"Yeah?
"
2,17,113,Ted:,"Are you still thinking about Lily?
"
2,17,114,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
2,17,115,Ted:,"Please stop.(voix off) And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...
"
2,17,116,Man:,"Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.
"
2,17,117,Marshall:,"Zitch dog!
"
2,17,118,Ted:,"Damn it!
"
2,17,119,Lily:,"You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.
"
2,17,120,Ted:,"That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.
"
2,17,121,Barney:,"With privileges, from the sound of it.
"
2,17,122,Mechanic:,"Eriksen. (Marshall follows the mechanic)
"
2,17,123,Barney:,"Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.
"
2,17,124,Marshall:,"He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.
"
2,17,125,Ted:,"Well, it's a pretty old car.
"
2,17,126,Robin:,"Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.
"
2,17,127,Marshall:,"I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.
"
2,17,128,Barney:,"How dare you...
"
2,17,129,Robibn:,"Hey.
"
2,17,130,Marshall:,"I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.
"
2,17,131,Marshall:,"Hitchhiking Waldo. (a guy is sitting between Barney and Marshall in the car)The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.
"
2,17,132,Robin:,"Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me.
"
2,17,133,Lily:,"The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.
"
2,17,134,Marshall:,"Guys, what are you talking about?
"
2,17,135,Lily:,"Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.
"
2,17,136,Robin:,"An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.
"
2,17,137,Lily:,"I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.
"
2,17,138,Robin:,"But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.
"
2,17,139,Lily:,"Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. (Lily slows down the car and knock down the food). Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about.
"
2,17,140,Robin:,"Lily, it's gonna be fine.
"
2,17,141,Lily:,"No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!
"
2,17,142,Robin:,"Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.
"
2,17,143,Lily:,"There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.
"
2,17,144,Robin:,"Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.
"
2,17,145,Lily:,"These cigars aren't helping at all.
"
2,17,146,Robin:,"Yeah. This was a terrible idea.
"
2,17,147,Lily:,"Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.
"
2,17,148,Marshall:,"The broken windows?
"
2,17,149,Lily:,"We had to make it look realistic.
"
2,17,150,Marshall:,"Why did you break two of them?
"
2,17,151,Robin:,"It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.
"
2,17,152,Marshall:,"Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.
"
2,17,153,Lily:,"Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.
"
2,17,154,Mechanic:,"Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?
"
2,17,155,Marshall:,"I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
"
2,17,156,Barney:,"Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.
"
2,17,157,Robin:,"Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?
"
2,17,158,Barney:,"Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!
"
2,17,159,Lily:,"What? Why?
"
2,17,160,Barney:,"Why? Why? Why?! Why?!
"
2,17,161,Ted:,"Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.
"
2,17,162,Ted:,"Hey.
"
2,17,163,Barney:,"Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.
"
2,17,164,Ted:,"Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.
"
2,17,165,Barney:,"Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.
"
2,17,166,Ted:,"To Queens?
"
2,17,167,Barney:,"Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.
"
2,17,168,Ted:,"h, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.
"
2,17,169,Barney:,"Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.
"
2,17,170,Ted:,"Wait! You know how to drive, right?
"
2,17,171,Barney:,"What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.
"
2,17,172,Ted:,"Which pedal's the gas?
"
2,17,173,Barney:,"Trick question.
"
2,17,174,Ted:,"No, it's not
"
2,17,175,Barney:,"Yes, it is.
"
2,17,176,Ted:,"No, it's not.
"
2,17,177,Barney:,"Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.
"
2,17,178,Ted:,"Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.
"
2,17,179,Barney:,"This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.
"
2,17,180,Ted:,"Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.
"
2,17,181,Barney:,"Dude, a dog.
"
2,17,182,Ted:,"Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.
"
2,17,183,Barney:,"What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.
"
2,17,184,Ted:,"Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.
"
2,17,185,Barney:,"Which? Which one's the break again?
"
2,17,186,Ted:,"The left one.
"
2,17,187,Barney:,"Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.
"
2,17,188,Ted:,"Make the Ls
"
2,17,189,.Barney:,"Oh, we're not going to make it.
"
2,17,190,Ted:,"Why did you just turn on the radio?
"
2,17,191,Barney:,"I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.
"
2,17,192,Ted:,"Relax. You're being crazy.
"
2,17,193,Barney:,"Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.
"
2,17,194,Ted:,"Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!
"
2,17,195,Barney:,"I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.
"
2,17,196,Ted:,"We're okay.
"
2,17,197,Barney:,"We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!
"
2,17,198,Robin:,"Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.
"
2,17,199,Ted:,"Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...
"
2,17,200,Barney:,"ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.
"
2,17,201,Lily:,"So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.
"
2,17,202,Barney:,"True story.
"
2,17,203,Marshall:,"Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.
"
2,17,204,Barney:,"Yes!
"
2,17,205,Ted and Robin:,"What?
"
2,17,206,Marshall:,"It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted: But 200,000...
"
2,17,207,Marshall:,"But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.
"
2,17,208,Lily:,"That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.
"
2,17,209,Marshall:,"I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.
"
2,17,210,Ted:,"You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.
"
2,17,211,Marshall:,"Affected.
"
2,17,212,Ted:,"That's what I said.
"
2,17,213,Marshall:,"Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.
"
2,17,214,Maechanic:,"Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.
"
2,17,215,Marshall:,"Close enough!
"
2,17,216,All:,"Close enough!
"
2,17,217,Ted (voix off):,"And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.
"
2,17,218,Marshall:,"Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace.
"
2,17,219,Barney:,"Rot in hell, devil steed.
"
2,17,220,Ted (voix off):,"And what better friend is there than that?
"
2,17,221,Marshall:,"Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.
"
2,17,222,Brother:,"Put it in.
"
2,17,223,Marshall:,"I am never going to get sick of this song. Never, ever, never, never, ever. Yeah!
"
2,3,1,Ted:,"Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.
"
2,3,2,Lily:,"I wish your face would melt off.
"
2,3,3,Marshall:,"I wish your eyeballs would explode.
"
2,3,4,Lily:,"I hate you.
"
2,3,5,Marshall:,"I hate you more.
"
2,3,6,Ted:,"I'm going to kill him.
"
2,3,7,Barney:,"I can't say I blame you.
"
2,3,8,Ted:,"No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.
"
2,3,9,Robin:,"I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.
"
2,3,10,Ted's mother:,"Not now.
"
2,3,11,Robin:,"Okay, if you don't, I will.
"
2,3,12,Ted's mother:,"Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)
"
2,3,13,Ted from 2030:,"Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part.
"
2,3,14,"The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030:","As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend.
"
2,3,15,Ted's mother:,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.
"
2,3,16,Ted:,"You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?
"
2,3,17,Ted's mother:,"Coffee?
"
2,3,18,Ted from 2030:,"You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real.
"
2,3,19,Lily:,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.
"
2,3,20,Ted's father:,"Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.
"
2,3,21,Marshall:,"Good to see you.
"
2,3,22,Lily:,"I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.
"
2,3,23,Ted's mother:,"Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well...
"
2,3,24,Marshall:,"Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?
"
2,3,25,Lily:,"Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?
"
2,3,26,Ted's mother:,"I love your hair.
"
2,3,27,Ted from 2030:,"This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.
"
2,3,28,Marshall:,"Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.
"
2,3,29,Ted's mother:,"Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00. Lily, would you like to join us?
"
2,3,30,Lily (looking at Marshall):,"Um...
"
2,3,31,Marshall:,"What?
"
2,3,32,Lily:,"Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.
"
2,3,33,Marshall:,"Why would it?
"
2,3,34,Lily:,"Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.
"
2,3,35,Marshall:,"Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.
"
2,3,36,Lily:,"""Brother and sister""?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. (She leaves)
"
2,3,37,Ted from 2030:,"See? Not awkward at all.
"
2,3,38,Lily:,"Hello, everyone.
"
2,3,39,All:,"Hi.
"
2,3,40,Lily:,"Hello, Marshall.
"
2,3,41,Ted's mother:,"Lily, that is a stunning dress.
"
2,3,42,Lily:,"Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, ""Hey, we're all family."" Right, bro? Ooh, ah...
"
2,3,43,Ted:,"What's wrong?
"
2,3,44,Lily:,"Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... (She breathes deeply while Marshall glances at her low neckline) Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.
"
2,3,45,Marshall:,"No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.
"
2,3,46,Marshall:,"Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.
"
2,3,47,Barney:,"Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.
"
2,3,48,Marshall:,"No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.
"
2,3,49,Barney:,"That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.
"
2,3,50,Marshall:,"Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.
"
2,3,51,Barney:,"I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.
"
2,3,52,Ted from 2030:,"So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.
"
2,3,53,Marshall:,"Hello.
"
2,3,54,Ted's father:,"Oh, hi.
"
2,3,55,Ted:,"Hey, Marshall.
"
2,3,56,Robin:,"Hey.
"
2,3,57,Lily:,"Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.
"
2,3,58,Marshall:,"Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?
"
2,3,59,Lily:,"Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (Marshall starts unzipping his knee zips) What are you doing?
"
2,3,60,Marshall:,"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. (He starts massaging his calve) Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up.
"
2,3,61,Marshall:,"Take off your dress.
"
2,3,62,Lily:,"Take off the rest of your pants.
"
2,3,63,Lily:,"I really wasn't expecting that to happen.
"
2,3,64,Marshall:,"Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?
"
2,3,65,Lily:,"Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.
"
2,3,66,Marshall:,"Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.
"
2,3,67,Lily:,"Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.
"
2,3,68,Marshall:,"Seduce you? You seduced me.
"
2,3,69,Lily:,"You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.
"
2,3,70,Marshall:,"You went to San Francisco for three months.
"
2,3,71,Lily:,"How is that seducing you?
"
2,3,72,Marshall:,"Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.
"
2,3,73,Lily:,"All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology.
"
2,3,74,Marshall:,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.
"
2,3,75,Lily:,"You are evil.
"
2,3,76,The waitress (taking a photo):,"Smile!
"
2,3,77,Ted:,"I'm going to kill him.
"
2,3,78,Barney:,"I can't say I blame you.
"
2,3,79,Ted:,"No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.
"
2,3,80,Ted from 2030:,"Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.
"
2,3,81,"The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030:","This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous.
"
2,3,82,Ted:,"Barney, what are you doing here?
"
2,3,83,Barney:,"Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.
"
2,3,84,Ted:,"I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.
"
2,3,85,Barney:,"What?
"
2,3,86,Ted:,"Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball.
"
2,3,87,Barney:,"But I'm your best friend.
"
2,3,88,Ted:,"Well, actually Marshall's my...
"
2,3,89,Barney:,"I'm the most important person in your life.
"
2,3,90,Ted:,"Well, Robin's actually...
"
2,3,91,Barney:,"How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.
"
2,3,92,Robin:,"To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.
"
2,3,93,Barney:,"Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.
"
2,3,94,Ted:,"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
"
2,3,95,Ted's father:,"Ted.
"
2,3,96,Ted:,"I know you've all been excited to meet...
"
2,3,97,Barney:,"Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint ""Bless This Mess"" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? (Ted's parents and Barney laugh)
"
2,3,98,Ted:,"Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.
"
2,3,99,Ted's father:,"Hello.
"
2,3,100,Robin:,"Hello.
"
2,3,101,Ted's mother:,"Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?
"
2,3,102,Ted's father:,"A real looker.
"
2,3,103,Robin:,"That's funny, I didn't even ""look"" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.
"
2,3,104,Barney (laughing):,"San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had.
"
2,3,105,Ted's mother:,"I love salmon risotto.
"
2,3,106,Barney:,"I know.
"
2,3,107,Robin:,"How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.
"
2,3,108,Barney:,"Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...
"
2,3,109,Ted:,"Stop it! Don't, don't!
"
2,3,110,Barney:,"Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?
"
2,3,111,Robin:,"What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.
"
2,3,112,Barney:,"Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!
"
2,3,113,Ted's mother:,"Can I help?
"
2,3,114,Barney:,"Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.
"
2,3,115,Ted's mother:,"Well, funny you should ask...
"
2,3,116,"At ""Casa a pezzi"". Barney is playing the piano.Ted's father:","Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!
"
2,3,117,Ted's mother:,"That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.
"
2,3,118,Barney:,"No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.
"
2,3,119,Lily:,"Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.
"
2,3,120,Marshall:,"All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.
"
2,3,121,Barney:,"Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?
"
2,3,122,Robin:,"No, I'm kind of tired.
"
2,3,123,Lily:,"Me, too.
"
2,3,124,Ted:,"Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...
"
2,3,125,Ted's father:,"I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.
"
2,3,126,Ted:,"Cervezas? Did he fall?
"
2,3,127,Ted's mother:,"I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.
"
2,3,128,Barney:,"St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.
"
2,3,129,Ted:,"Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?
"
2,3,130,Barney:,"I'll save you a seat.
"
2,3,131,Ted's mother:,"Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?
"
2,3,132,Robin:,"Robin.
"
2,3,133,Barney:,"Susan, her name is Virginia.
"
2,3,134,Barney:,"Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.
"
2,3,135,Ted:,"Why?
"
2,3,136,Barney:,"Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?
"
2,3,137,Ted's father (talking to a girl):,"So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety.
"
2,3,138,Girl:,"Wow. You're like a hero.
"
2,3,139,Barney:,"Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.
"
2,3,140,Girl:,"You poor, brave man.
"
2,3,141,Ted's father:,"Why don't you give the guy a hug?
"
2,3,142,Barney:,"I'm... oh. (They hug).
"
2,3,143,Ted:,"My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?
"
2,3,144,Barney:,"I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.
"
2,3,145,Ted:,"Sure.
"
2,3,146,Barney:,"Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...
"
2,3,147,(Flashback:,"Barney arrives in the bar, sees Ted's father making out with Wendy and takes a photo of them with his phone. Back at the apartment, he hands Ted the phone)
"
2,3,148,Ted:,"Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!
"
2,3,149,Barney:,"I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?
"
2,3,150,Ted:,"My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.
"
2,3,151,Barney:,"Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.
"
2,3,152,Ted:,"Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""?
"
2,3,153,Barney:,"You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.
"
2,3,154,Ted:,"That's not a real Web site.
"
2,3,155,Barney:,"Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.
"
2,3,156,Ted:,"Hi, Dad.
"
2,3,157,Ted's father:,"Hey, Ted. Barney!
"
2,3,158,Ted:,"Enjoying your vacation so far?
"
2,3,159,Ted's father:,"Oh, yeah.
"
2,3,160,Ted:,"Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?
"
2,3,161,Ted's father:,"Sure.
"
2,3,162,Ted:,"So you went out with Barney last night?
"
2,3,163,Ted's father:,"Yeah.
"
2,3,164,Ted:,"You have a good time?
"
2,3,165,Ted's father:,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us.
"
2,3,166,Ted:,"Yeah. So...
"
2,3,167,Ted's father:,"What?
"
2,3,168,Ted:,"Well...
"
2,3,169,Ted's father:,"Well what?
"
2,3,170,Ted:,"You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?
"
2,3,171,Ted:,"I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene
"
2,3,172,Barney:,"Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.
"
2,3,173,The waitress (taking a photo):,"Smile!
"
2,3,174,Robin:,"I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.
"
2,3,175,Ted's mother:,"Not now.
"
2,3,176,Robin:,"Okay, if you don't, I will.
"
2,3,177,Ted's mother:,"Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)
"
2,3,178,Ted from 2030:,"Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and Robin part of the story.
"
2,3,179,Ted from 2030:,"We were expecting my parents at any minute.
"
2,3,180,Ted:,"One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.
"
2,3,181,Robin:,"But this is the first time she's meeting me.
"
2,3,182,Ted:,"Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.
"
2,3,183,Robin:,"But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?
"
2,3,184,Ted:,"You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.
"
2,3,185,Robin:,"I'm gonna lie.
"
2,3,186,Ted:,"I would.
"
2,3,187,Lily:,"Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.
"
2,3,188,Marshall:,"I know how important it is to you.
"
2,3,189,Ted's mother:,"I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day. Stacy's pregnant again.
"
2,3,190,Ted:,"Oh, good for her.
"
2,3,191,Ted's mother (to Robin):,"So, dear...
"
2,3,192,Robin:,"Oh, boy.
"
2,3,193,Ted's mother:,"Tell us what it's like being a journalist.
"
2,3,194,Robin:,"I'm just not ready.
"
2,3,195,Ted's mother:,"Okay. No pressure.
"
2,3,196,Robin:,"Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great.
"
2,3,197,Ted's mother:,"Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.
"
2,3,198,Barney:,"Ooh, a piano!
"
2,3,199,Ted:,"You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?
"
2,3,200,Robin:,"Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.
"
2,3,201,Ted:,"Hooray?
"
2,3,202,Robin:,"I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.
"
2,3,203,Ted:,"Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.
"
2,3,204,Barney:,"What happened to Marshall and Lily?
"
2,3,205,Ted:,"They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.
"
2,3,206,Waitress:,"More coffee?
"
2,3,207,Ted's mother:,"Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet?
"
2,3,208,Robin:,"Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.
"
2,3,209,Ted's mother:,"Excuse me?
"
2,3,210,Robin:,"Nothing. (She leaves the table to go to the bathroom, the door is locked, she knocks.)
"
2,3,211,Lily:,"Just a minute.
"
2,3,212,Marshall:,"Maybe less.
"
2,3,213,Ted's mother:,"Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you?
"
2,3,214,Robin:,"Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?
"
2,3,215,Ted's mother:,"Do you want to have my grandkids?
"
2,3,216,Robin:,"No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...
"
2,3,217,Marshall:,"Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.
"
2,3,218,Lily:,"Marshall, your zipper.
"
2,3,219,Ted's mother:,"Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young.
"
2,3,220,Robin:,"Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?
"
2,3,221,Ted's mother:,"Well... Okay, there's something you don't know...
"
2,3,222,Waitress:,"Smile!
"
2,3,223,Lily:,"I wish your face would melt off.
"
2,3,224,Marshall:,"I wish your eyeballs would explode.
"
2,3,225,Ted:,"I'm gonna kill him.
"
2,3,226,Robin:,"I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.
"
2,3,227,Ted's mother:,"Not now.
"
2,3,228,Robin:,"Okay, if you don't, I will.
"
2,3,229,Ted's mother:,"Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)
"
2,3,230,Ted's father:,"Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart.
"
2,3,231,Ted:,"Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy! (To the waitress) I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad.
"
2,3,232,Ted's mother:,"Ted, what are you talking about?
"
2,3,233,Ted:,"Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?
"
2,3,234,Ted's father:,"Okay. I hooked up with a waitress.
"
2,3,235,Ted's mother:,"Oh.
"
2,3,236,Ted:,"Oh?
"
2,3,237,Ted's mother:,"I mean, oh! Oh! Ooh! We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al. Oh, ooh!
"
2,3,238,Ted:,"Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?
"
2,3,239,Robin:,"Mrs. Mosby?
"
2,3,240,Ted's mother:,"Ted, we weren't quite sure how to tell you this...
"
2,3,241,Ted's father:,"Your mother and I are divorced.
"
2,3,242,Ted:,"What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?
"
2,3,243,Ted's mother:,"Oh, gosh, it's been about nine months now.
"
2,3,244,Ted's father:,"Closer to ten, I think.
"
2,3,245,Ted's mother:,"Time flies.
"
2,3,246,Ted:,"So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?
"
2,3,247,Ted's mother:,"No, it wasn't a snap decision.
"
2,3,248,Ted's father:,"We'd been separated almost two years.
"
2,3,249,Ted:,"How could you not tell me this?!
"
2,3,250,Ted's mother:,"We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time.
"
2,3,251,Ted:,"So last Christmas...?
"
2,3,252,Ted's father:,"We talked about telling you kids then, but it didn't seem very Christmasy.
"
2,3,253,Ted:,"I got you a tandem bike.
"
2,3,254,Ted's father:,"Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time.
"
2,3,255,Ted:,"Who the hell is Frank?!
"
2,3,256,Ted's father:,"Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces.
"
2,3,257,Ted:,"Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. (He leaves, following by his parents and Robin)
"
2,3,258,Ted's mother:,"Teddy bear, oh...
"
2,3,259,Barney:,"You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.
"
2,3,260,Marshall:,"Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.
"
2,3,261,Lily:,"Me, too.
"
2,3,262,Marshall:,"I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.
"
2,3,263,Lily:,"It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.
"
2,3,264,Marshall:,"Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?
"
2,3,265,Lily:,"Did you Mystic Tan your calves?
"
2,3,266,Marshall:,"I withdraw the question.
"
2,3,267,Outside.Ted's father:,"We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce.
"
2,3,268,Ted's mother:,"It was wrong not to tell you.
"
2,3,269,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
2,3,270,Ted's father:,"But listen, don't tell your sister.
"
2,3,271,Ted's mother:,"It would just upset her.
"
2,3,272,Ted:,"No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.
"
2,3,273,Ted's father:,"Indians won today on a walk-off double.
"
2,3,274,Ted:,"Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.
"
2,3,275,Ted's father:,"I never told you how I met your mother?
"
2,3,276,Ted:,"No.
"
2,3,277,Ted's father:,"Oh, great story. At a bar.
"
2,3,278,Ted:,"That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.
"
2,3,279,Ted's father:,"I think it was an Irish bar.
"
2,3,280,Ted:,"I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?
"
2,3,281,Ted's father:,"We just realized we're very different people.
"
2,3,282,Ted's mother:,"Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.
"
2,3,283,Ted:,"So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.
"
2,3,284,Ted's father:,"I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.
"
2,3,285,Ted:,"Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.
"
2,3,286,Ted's mother:,"On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.
"
2,3,287,Ted's father:,"Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.
"
2,3,288,Ted's mother:,"But we love Robin.
"
2,3,289,Ted's father:,"Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.
"
2,3,290,Ted's mother:,"We'll see you inside.
"
2,3,291,Ted's father:,"Sorry.
"
2,3,292,Robin:,"Wow.
"
2,3,293,Ted:,"I know.
"
2,3,294,Robin:,"They love me!
"
2,3,295,"Back inside, later.Ted's mother:","So we are definitely going to try and communicate more.
"
2,3,296,Ted's father:,"From now on, full disclosure.
"
2,3,297,Ted:,"Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.
"
2,3,298,Ted's mother:,"I'm gonna get some juice.
"
2,3,299,Ted:,"No. No.
"
2,3,300,Ted's father:,"You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker.
"
2,7,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.
"
2,7,2,Lily:,"It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.
"
2,7,3,Ted from 2030:,"And she did find it.
"
2,7,4,Lily (coming in Robin's):,"I'm going to be a life coach.
"
2,7,5,Ted from 2030:,"In fact, she found it again and again.
"
2,7,6,Lily:,"I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.
"
2,7,7,Robin (on the phone):,"Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.
"
2,7,8,Ted:,"What is she doing for money through all this?
"
2,7,9,Robin:,"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.
"
2,7,10,Ted:,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?
"
2,7,11,Robin:,"No.
"
2,7,12,Marshall:,"Here she comes. Here she comes.
"
2,7,13,Lily:,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.
"
2,7,14,Robin:,"I'm sorry.
"
2,7,15,Barney:,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her).
"
2,7,16,Lily:,"What do you want?
"
2,7,17,Ted:,"I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.
"
2,7,18,Lily:,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.
"
2,7,19,Barney:,"I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
"
2,7,20,Ted:,"No.
"
2,7,21,Lily:,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.
"
2,7,22,Ted:,"Robin, nothing to add?
"
2,7,23,Robin:,"No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.
"
2,7,24,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
2,7,25,Robin:,"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.
"
2,7,26,Marshall:,"I've never need the beer more than I do right now.
"
2,7,27,Ted:,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""
"
2,7,28,Marshall:,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.
"
2,7,29,Barney:,"Really? Laid, you say?
"
2,7,30,Marshall:,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.
"
2,7,31,Barney:,"She hot?
"
2,7,32,Marshall:,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.
"
2,7,33,Barney:,"And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
"
2,7,34,Robin:,"A what?
"
2,7,35,Barney:,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.
"
2,7,36,Ted:,"What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
"
2,7,37,Barney:,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.
"
2,7,38,Marshall:,"I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...
"
2,7,39,Barney:,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.
"
2,7,40,Lily (arriving):,"So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...
"
2,7,41,Marshall:,"Classic.
"
2,7,42,Robin:,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?
"
2,7,43,Ted:,"Yeah. Somebody did just quit.
"
2,7,44,Ted:,"So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)
"
2,7,45,Marshall:,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.
"
2,7,46,Ted:,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
"
2,7,47,Robin:,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.
"
2,7,48,Ted:,"It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
"
2,7,49,Barney:,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.
"
2,7,50,Ted:,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?
"
2,7,51,Lily:,"What would I be doing?
"
2,7,52,Ted:,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.
"
2,7,53,Ted:,"You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
"
2,7,54,Lily:,"Oh, right, is that the...?
"
2,7,55,Ted:,"Yeah. Here's the model.
"
2,7,56,Lily:,"You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.
"
2,7,57,Ted:,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.
"
2,7,58,Lily:,"How can he not see it? I mean there's the...
"
2,7,59,Ted:,"I know.
"
2,7,60,Lily:,"And the way it...
"
2,7,61,Ted:,"I know.
"
2,7,62,Lily:,"And the two little...
"
2,7,63,Ted:,"I know.
"
2,7,64,Lily:,"It is just...
"
2,7,65,Mr Druthers (arriving):,"Spectacular? Why, thank you.
"
2,7,66,Ted:,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.
"
2,7,67,Mr Druthers:,"Ah.
"
2,7,68,Lily:,"Nice to meet you.
"
2,7,69,Mr Druthers:,"Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?
"
2,7,70,Ted:,"I, uh... I am an architect.
"
2,7,71,Mr Druthers:,"Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?
"
2,7,72,Ted:,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.
"
2,7,73,Mr Druthers:,"Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?
"
2,7,74,Ted:,"Absolutely.
"
2,7,75,Mr Druthers:,"So you're going to design the...
"
2,7,76,Ted:,"Styrofoam trees.
"
2,7,77,Mr Druthers:,"Once again, with feeling.
"
2,7,78,Ted:,"Styrofoam trees.
"
2,7,79,Mr Druthers:,"Styrofoam trees!
"
2,7,80,Ted:,"Styrofoam trees!
"
2,7,81,Mr Druthers:,"That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)
"
2,7,82,Lily:,"Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)
"
2,7,83,Marshall:,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.
"
2,7,84,Barney:,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.
"
2,7,85,Marshall:,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.
"
2,7,86,Barney:,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?
"
2,7,87,Marshall:,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.
"
2,7,88,"Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent):","Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...
"
2,7,89,Pr Lewis:,"Tell me what you want or get out.
"
2,7,90,Barney:,"Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.
"
2,7,91,Pr Lewis:,"Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.
"
2,7,92,Lily:,"I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.
"
2,7,93,Ted:,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.
"
2,7,94,Robin:,"Did you show lily your design?
"
2,7,95,Ted:,"No.
"
2,7,96,Lily:,"What design?
"
2,7,97,Ted:,"It's nothing.
"
2,7,98,Robin:,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.
"
2,7,99,Lily:,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.
"
2,7,100,Ted:,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!
"
2,7,101,Barney:,"Oh, my god. Incredible.
"
2,7,102,Pr Lewis:,"Hmm... C minus.
"
2,7,103,Barney:,"C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!
"
2,7,104,Pr Lewis:,"You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.
"
2,7,105,Lily:,"Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.
"
2,7,106,Ted:,"Okay, I'm done.
"
2,7,107,Lily:,"Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.
"
2,7,108,Ted:,"Great. Thanks.
"
2,7,109,Mr Druthers:,"Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
"
2,7,110,Ted:,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.
"
2,7,111,Mr Druthers:,"Too green.
"
2,7,112,Ted:,"Too green?
"
2,7,113,Mr Druthers:,"Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?
"
2,7,114,Ted:,"I can't un-picture it.
"
2,7,115,Mr Druthers:,"Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!
"
2,7,116,Ted:,"What? What's gone?
"
2,7,117,Mr Druthers:,"My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
"
2,7,118,Ted:,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.
"
2,7,119,Mr Druthers:,"What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.
"
2,7,120,Ted:,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.
"
2,7,121,Mr Druthers:,"Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.
"
2,7,122,Ted:,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)
"
2,7,123,Lily:,"Hey.
"
2,7,124,Ted:,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?
"
2,7,125,Lily:,"That's easy. I took it.
"
2,7,126,Ted:,"Why?
"
2,7,127,Lily:,"It's simple.
"
2,7,128,[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers:,"I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university
"
2,7,129,Mr Druthers:,"Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.
"
2,7,130,Mr Druthers (to a kid):,"What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!
"
2,7,131,Lily:,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.
"
2,7,132,Ted:,"What does his ball have to do with anything?
"
2,7,133,Lily:,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.
"
2,7,134,Robin:,"Hey, guys. What's going on?
"
2,7,135,Ted:,"Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
"
2,7,136,Robin:,"Why? Was he being mean?
"
2,7,137,Ted:,"You know about this?
"
2,7,138,Robin:,"Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?
"
2,7,139,Lily:,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.
"
2,7,140,Robin:,"I gave them to you for your birthday.
"
2,7,141,Ted:,"So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
"
2,7,142,Lily:,"I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""
"
2,7,143,Ted:,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.
"
2,7,144,Lily:,"So is being mean.
"
2,7,145,Ted:,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.
"
2,7,146,Lily:,"Well, that's why I left a note.
"
2,7,147,Ted:,"A note?
"
2,7,148,Lily:,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.
"
2,7,149,Ted:,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.
"
2,7,150,Lily:,"I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.
"
2,7,151,Marshall:,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.
"
2,7,152,Barney:,"I know, I know.
"
2,7,153,Marshall:,"You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.
"
2,7,154,Barney:,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.
"
2,7,155,Marshall:,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.
"
2,7,156,Barney:,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.
"
2,7,157,Barney:,"I think I'm falling in love with you.
"
2,7,158,Pr Lewis:,"Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.
"
2,7,159,Barney:,"What? No.We had s*x yesterday.
"
2,7,160,Pr Lewis:,"Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.
"
2,7,161,Ted:,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.
"
2,7,162,Lily:,"No.
"
2,7,163,Ted:,"What do you mean, no?
"
2,7,164,Lily:,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.
"
2,7,165,Ted:,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.
"
2,7,166,Mr Druthers:,"Everybody get in here now!
"
2,7,167,Lily:,"""Who wants espresso?""
"
2,7,168,Mr Druthers:,"Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.
"
2,7,169,Lily:,"Interesting.
"
2,7,170,Mr Druthers:,"Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!
"
2,7,171,Lily:,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.
"
2,7,172,Ted:,"Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.
"
2,7,173,Lily:,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.
"
2,7,174,Ted:,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.
"
2,7,175,Lily:,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.
"
2,7,176,Ted:,"No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
"
2,7,177,Lily:,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.
"
2,7,178,Ted:,"Then you're fired.
"
2,7,179,Lily:,"Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.
"
2,7,180,Marshall:,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.
"
2,7,181,Barney:,"Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.
"
2,7,182,Marshall:,"So you're going back over there?
"
2,7,183,Barney:,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.
"
2,7,184,Barney:,"I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.
"
2,7,185,Pr Lewis:,"Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.
"
2,7,186,Barney:,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.
"
2,7,187,Pr Lewis:,"Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.
"
2,7,188,Mr Druthers:,"Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.
"
2,7,189,Ted:,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.
"
2,7,190,Mr Druthers:,"Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.
"
2,7,191,Ted:,"Lily was mentally deranged.
"
2,7,192,Mr Druthers:,"You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.
"
2,7,193,Ted:,"Lily was mentally deranged!
"
2,7,194,Mr Druthers:,"Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?
"
2,7,195,Man:,"The clients are here.
"
2,7,196,Mr Druthers:,"Excellent. Bring them in.
"
2,7,197,Ted from 2030:,"Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.
"
2,7,198,Mr Druthers:,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.
"
2,7,199,Client:,"That's a pen1s!
"
2,7,200,Mr Druthers:,"That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.
"
2,7,201,Client:,"We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?
"
2,7,202,Mr Druthers:,"Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.
"
2,7,203,Client:,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.
"
2,7,204,Ted from 2030:,"The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.
"
2,7,205,Ted:,"Wait! We have one more idea for you.
"
2,7,206,Mr Druthers:,"Ted, what are you doing?
"
2,7,207,Ted:,"I have another design.
"
2,7,208,Mr Druthers:,"Sit down, shut up right now.
"
2,7,209,Ted:,"No.
"
2,7,210,Robin:,"To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!
"
2,7,211,All:,"Probably!
"
2,7,212,Lily:,"Congrats, ted.
"
2,7,213,Ted:,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.
"
2,7,214,Lily:,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.
"
2,7,215,Ted:,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...
"
2,7,216,Lily:,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.
"
2,7,217,Lily:,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.
"
2,7,218,Robin:,"Barney! Oh, my god!
"
2,7,219,Ted:,"What happened?
"
2,7,220,Pr Lewis:,"He broke his hip.
"
2,7,221,Barney:,"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.
"
2,7,222,Pr Lewis:,"No, he's not fine.
"
2,7,223,Marshall:,"Professor Lewis, hi.
"
2,7,224,Pr Lewis:,"Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.
"
2,7,225,Barney:,"Yeah, she was.
"
2,7,226,Pr Lewis:,"B plus.
"
2,7,227,Barney:,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!
"
2,7,228,Marshall:,"Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
"
2,7,229,Barney:,"It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!
"
2,13,1,Ted (voix off):,"Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.
"
2,13,2,Boy:,"That's stupid. (he destroys Ted's tower.)
"
2,13,3,Ted (voix off):,"There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.
"
2,13,4,Ted:,"Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.
"
2,13,5,Mr. Druthers:,"That's stupid. (he destroys his model)
"
2,13,6,Ted:,"I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.
"
2,13,7,Mr Druthers:,"Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?
"
2,13,8,Ted (voix off):,"I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it.
"
2,13,9,Mr Druthers:,"Stairs?
"
2,13,10,Ted (voix off):,"And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.
"
2,13,11,Ted:,"Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.
"
2,13,12,Co-worker:,"Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.
"
2,13,13,Ted (voix off):,"But suddenly I was a different guy.
"
2,13,14,Ted:,"Hey, guys. What's so funny?
"
2,13,15,Co-worker:,"Nothing. Um... nice shirt.
"
2,13,16,Ted:,"Thanks.
"
2,13,17,Ted (voix off):,"The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.
"
2,13,18,Ted:,"Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.
"
2,13,19,Robin:,"Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.
"
2,13,20,Ted (voix off):,"Before, I used to be this guy.
"
2,13,21,Ted:,"Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.
"
2,13,22,Ted (voix off):,"But now...I was this guy.
"
2,13,23,Ted:,"Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work.
"
2,13,24,Ted (voix off):,"But still, the worst part was Druthers.
"
2,13,25,Ted:,"Well, I was thinking...
"
2,13,26,Mr Druthers:,"Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.
"
2,13,27,Robin:,"Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.
"
2,13,28,Ted:,"Why would you say that?
"
2,13,29,Robin:,"Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.
"
2,13,30,Barney:,"I have found that to be true.
"
2,13,31,Marshall:,"It's a blessing and a curse really.
"
2,13,32,Lily:,"Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.
"
2,13,33,Marshall:,"Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?
"
2,13,34,Ted:,"Tony.
"
2,13,35,Robin:,"Angela.
"
2,13,36,Barney:,"Mona.
"
2,13,37,Robin:,"Mona?
"
2,13,38,Barney:,"Watch it more closely. Rock your world.
"
2,13,39,Robin:,"So, what are you gonna do?
"
2,13,40,Ted:,"Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.
"
2,13,41,MP:,"Fire him.
"
2,13,42,Ted:,"Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.
"
2,13,43,MP:,"Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.
"
2,13,44,Ted:,"Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.
"
2,13,45,MP:,"Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby.
"
2,13,46,Barney:,"You mind if I charge my phone?
"
2,13,47,Ted:,"Knock yourself out.
"
2,13,48,Robin:,"Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?
"
2,13,49,Robin:,"Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.
"
2,13,50,Ted:,"You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.
"
2,13,51,Barney:,"Oh, my God! (barney's holding a painting)
"
2,13,52,Ted:,"What?
"
2,13,53,Barney:,"Do you know about this?
"
2,13,54,Ted:,"No.
"
2,13,55,Robin:,"What is that?
"
2,13,56,Barney:,"Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.
"
2,13,57,Ted:,"Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.
"
2,13,58,Barney:,"I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.
"
2,13,59,Robin:,"Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.
"
2,13,60,Barney:,"Oh, come on, Robin.
"
2,13,61,Robin:,"No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.
"
2,13,62,Barney:,"I know! We're gonna have so much fun!
"
2,13,63,Mr Druthers:,"Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?
"
2,13,64,Ted:,"Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.
"
2,13,65,Mr Druthers:,"Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.
"
2,13,66,Ted:,"This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.
"
2,13,67,Employees:,"Happy birthday to you.
"
2,13,68,Mr Druthers:,"Oh, you had me. You so had me.
"
2,13,69,Robin:,"So, you didn't fire him?
"
2,13,70,Ted:,"I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.
"
2,13,71,Barney:,"Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.
"
2,13,72,Marshall:,"Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.
"
2,13,73,Robin:,"And, uh... I... got you a rose.
"
2,13,74,Marshall:,"Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.
"
2,13,75,Barney:,"Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.
"
2,13,76,Robin:,"Oh, wow, a new dart.
"
2,13,77,Ted:,"Hey, that new dart is great.
"
2,13,78,Robin:,"I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.
"
2,13,79,Barney:,"Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art.
"
2,13,80,Ted:," Nude art.
"
2,13,81,Robin:," Nude art.
"
2,13,82,Marshall:,"Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?
"
2,13,83,Lily:,"I knew this day would come.
"
2,13,84,Marshall:,"How did you know that?
"
2,13,85,Lily:,"Because I didn't hide it very well.
"
2,13,86,Ted (voix off):,"So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.
"
2,13,87,Marshall:,"Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.
"
2,13,88,Lily:,"It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.
"
2,13,89,Marshall:,"The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!
"
2,13,90,Lily:,"No, he's actually a little husky...
"
2,13,91,Marshall:,"Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.
"
2,13,92,Lily:,"Okay, just forget it.
"
2,13,93,Marshall:,"Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.
"
2,13,94,Lily:,"Well, then you'll have to do it.
"
2,13,95,Marshall:,"Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?
"
2,13,96,Lily:,"We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.
"
2,13,97,Barney:,"We totally saw your butt.
"
2,13,98,Marshall:,"This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.
"
2,13,99,Barney:,"Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?
"
2,13,100,Marshall:,"Where is it?
"
2,13,101,Barney:,"I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.
"
2,13,102,Marshall:,"You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?
"
2,13,103,Barney:,"Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?
"
2,13,104,Ted:,"Field trip!
"
2,13,105,Barney:,"Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.
"
2,13,106,Carl:,"Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?
"
2,13,107,Marshall:,"What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!
"
2,13,108,Carl:,"Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.
"
2,13,109,Marshall:,"I know that Barney gave you that painting.
"
2,13,110,Carl:,"I don't know what you're talking about.
"
2,13,111,Marshall:,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.
"
2,13,112,Carl:,"I doubt it.
"
2,13,113,Marshall:,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.
"
2,13,114,Carl:,"I doubt it.
"
2,13,115,Marshall:,"All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.
"
2,13,116,Carl:,"I doubt it.
"
2,13,117,Marshall:,"This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
"
2,13,118,Robin:,"Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?
"
2,13,119,Barney:,"Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...
"
2,13,120,Ted:,"One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.
"
2,13,121,Robin:,"Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.
"
2,13,122,Lily:,"You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.
"
2,13,123,Barney:,"Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.
"
2,13,124,Lily:,"Are you serious?
"
2,13,125,Barney:,"Yeah.
"
2,13,126,Lily:,"Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?
"
2,13,127,Barney:,"Paint me.
"
2,13,128,Lily:,"What?
"
2,13,129,Barney:,"Paint me.
"
2,13,130,Voice:,"Who's that? Who's out there?
"
2,13,131,Ted:,"Hammond, is that you?
"
2,13,132,Mr Druthers:,"Mosby?
"
2,13,133,Ted (voix off):,"Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.
"
2,13,134,Mr Druters:,"Uh, look, just a second, Ted.
"
2,13,135,Ted:,"Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?
"
2,13,136,Mr Druthers:,"What are you doing?
"
2,13,137,Ted:,"I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?
"
2,13,138,Mr Druthers:,"Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.
"
2,13,139,Ted:,"Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...
"
2,13,140,Mr Druthers:,"Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.
"
2,13,141,Ted:,"It's okay.
"
2,13,142,Mr Druthers:,"What did you want to say to me?
"
2,13,143,Ted:,"Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?
"
2,13,144,Mr Druthers:,"Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?
"
2,13,145,Ted:,"Yeah, I do.
"
2,13,146,Mr Druthers:,"Cause I design homes.
"
2,13,147,Ted:,"I see it.
"
2,13,148,Mr Druthers:,"But I don't have a home.
"
2,13,149,Ted:,"Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.
"
2,13,150,Mr Druthers:,"Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?
"
2,13,151,Ted:,"Uh, no, I don't.
"
2,13,152,Mr Druthers:,"If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.
"
2,13,153,Ted:,"Well, that's the dream.
"
2,13,154,Mr Druthers:,"I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.
"
2,13,155,Ted:,"Me too, Hammond.
"
2,13,156,Mr Druthers:,"Call me Ham.
"
2,13,157,Ted:,"No, thanks.
"
2,13,158,Mr Druthers:,"Hammy D?
"
2,13,159,Ted:,"No, I think just Hammond.
"
2,13,160,Robin:,"So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.
"
2,13,161,Ted:,"I was this close.
"
2,13,162,Ted (voix off):,"Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.
"
2,13,163,Lily:,"Oh honey, you're awake?
"
2,13,164,Marshall:,"I'm awake. Is everything okay?
"
2,13,165,Lily:,"Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?
"
2,13,166,Marshall:,"Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.
"
2,13,167,Lily:,"Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?
"
2,13,168,Marshall:,"It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.
"
2,13,169,Lily:,"Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?
"
2,13,170,Marshall:,"Loch Ness?
"
2,13,171,Lily:,"Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...
"
2,13,172,Marshall:,"Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.
"
2,13,173,Lily:,"Maybe we can.
"
2,13,174,Barney:,"Paint me.
"
2,13,175,Lily:,"Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?
"
2,13,176,Barney:,"We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.
"
2,13,177,Lily:,"Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.
"
2,13,178,Barney:,"Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.
"
2,13,179,Lily:,"Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.
"
2,13,180,Barney:,"I'll give you $5,000.
"
2,13,181,Marshall:,"We're going to Loch Ness!
"
2,13,182,Lily:,"Yeah!
"
2,13,183,Ted:,"That cabby would not shut up.
"
2,13,184,Mr Druthers:,"Yeah, we should call him a gabby.
"
2,13,185,Ted:,"I think it, you say it.
"
2,13,186,Mr Druthers:,"Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.
"
2,13,187,Ted:,"Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.
"
2,13,188,Mr Druthers:,"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it: Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez.
"
2,13,189,Ted:,"What?
"
2,13,190,Mr Druthers:,"You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...
"
2,13,191,Ted:,"Can I see you for one second?
"
2,13,192,Mr Druthers:,"Ooh, I'm in trouble now.
"
2,13,193,Ted:,"What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.
"
2,13,194,Mr Druthers:,"We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.
"
2,13,195,Ted:,"What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my
"
2,13,196,Mr Druthers:,"Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.
"
2,13,197,Lily:,"Okay, let's get this over with.
"
2,13,198,Barney:,"Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.
"
2,13,199,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
2,13,200,Barney:,"I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong.
"
2,13,201,Lily:,"I don't think your sword will fit.
"
2,13,202,Barney:,"I get that a lot.
"
2,13,203,Ted (voix off):,"And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.
"
2,13,204,Marshall:,"This isn't right. This isn't right at all.
"
2,13,205,Ted (voix off):,"Finally, he could take it no more.
"
2,13,206,Lily:,"Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!
"
2,13,207,Barney:,"Paint faster!
"
2,13,208,Lily:,"Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.
"
2,13,209,Barney:,"Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...
"
2,13,210,Lily:,"Oh, just drop them!
"
2,13,211,Barney:,"All right.
"
2,13,212,Marshall:,"No! No, this is not right!
"
2,13,213,Barney:,"We had a deal!
"
2,13,214,Marshall:,"Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!
"
2,13,215,Barney:,"You...!
"
2,13,216,Marshall:,"It's over! (he closes the door at Barney's face). (Yelling) Lily, I can't let you go through with this! (whispering) I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand. (Yelling) It's just not right! (whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.
"
2,13,217,Barney:,"Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.
"
2,13,218,Marshall:," We accept.
"
2,13,219,Barney:,"You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.
"
2,13,220,Ted (voix off):,"And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.
"
2,13,221,Mr Druthers:,"Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.
"
2,13,222,Ted:,"No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...
"
2,13,223,Man:,"Looking for Hammond Druthers.
"
2,13,224,Mr Druthers:,"Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.
"
2,13,225,Man:,"These are divorce papers. You've been served.
"
2,13,226,Ted:,"Oh, God.
"
2,13,227,Mr Druthers:,"She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.
"
2,13,228,Ted:,"There is no easy way to say this, but...
"
2,13,229,Mr Druthers:,"She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.
"
2,13,230,Ted:,"Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...
"
2,13,231,Men (singing):,"# Happy birthday to you... #
"
2,13,232,Ted:,"You've got to be kidding me!
"
2,13,233,Mr Druthers:,"Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.
"
2,13,234,Ted:,"Wait, his birthday was yesterday!
"
2,13,235,Man:,"Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought...
"
2,13,236,Ted:,"No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?
"
2,13,237,Mr Druthers:,"Oh, God...
"
2,13,238,Ted:,"Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.
"
2,13,239,Ted (voix off):,"And there it was, rock bottom: They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career.
"
2,13,240,Man:,"Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss.
"
2,13,241,Lily:,"Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.
"
2,13,242,Barney:,"Thank you very much, Lily.
"
2,13,243,Lily:,"Marshall, do you have the money?
"
2,13,244,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
2,13,245,Lily:,"Let's get out of here!
"
2,13,246,Barney:,"A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?! Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment. She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme.
"
2,12,1,Ted (V.O.):,"Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.
"
2,12,2,Ted:,"I think I'm in love with you.
"
2,12,3,Robin:,"What?!
"
2,12,4,Ted (voix off):,"Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages.
"
2,12,5,Robin:,"Spider! Spider!
"
2,12,6,Barney:,"I left something in the hallway.
"
2,12,7,Ted:,"Where?
"
2,12,8,Robin:,"Right there.
"
2,12,9,Ted:,"Got it.
"
2,12,10,Ted (voix off):,"First there's the moment when you think you think it.
"
2,12,11,Ted:,"Whoa, still alive.
"
2,12,12,Ted (voix off):,"There's the moment you think you know it.
"
2,12,13,Robin is sick and in bed:,"
"
2,12,14,Robin:,"Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.
"
2,12,15,Ted:,"Totally worth it.
"
2,12,16,Ted (voix off):,"There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.
"
2,12,17,Ted:,"All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?
"
2,12,18,Robin:,"Good night.
"
2,12,19,Ted:,"Good night.
"
2,12,20,Robin:,"Wait, Ted?
"
2,12,21,Ted:,"Yeah?
"
2,12,22,Robin:,"Good night.
"
2,12,23,Robin:,"Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.
"
2,12,24,Ted:,"That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.
"
2,12,25,Robin:,"Really? You'd do that?
"
2,12,26,Ted:,"Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.
"
2,12,27,Ted (voix off):,"And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.
"
2,12,28,Robin:,"Ted.
"
2,12,29,Ted:,"Yeah?
"
2,12,30,Robin:,"Falafel.
"
2,12,31,Lily:,"Falafel?
"
2,12,32,Robin:,"Falafel.
"
2,12,33,Lily:,"Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?
"
2,12,34,Robin:,"I totally choked.
"
2,12,35,Lily:,"I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?
"
2,12,36,Robin:,"Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.
"
2,12,37,Lily:,"Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.
"
2,12,38,Robin:,"Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.
"
2,12,39,Lily:,"Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.
"
2,12,40,Barney:,"Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.
"
2,12,41,Marshall:,"Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.
"
2,12,42,Barney:,"No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.
"
2,12,43,Robin:,"So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.
"
2,12,44,Barney:,"The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.
"
2,12,45,Ted:,"What?
"
2,12,46,Barney:,"Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""
"
2,12,47,Robin:,"So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.
"
2,12,48,Lily:,"Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.
"
2,12,49,Robin:,"It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.
"
2,12,50,Lily:,"Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.
"
2,12,51,Robin:,"Oh, here comes Katie.
"
2,12,52,Lily:,"Aw, your sister's so cute.
"
2,12,53,Robin:,"Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.
"
2,12,54,Lily:,"Hello, Kitty.
"
2,12,55,Robin:,"Oh, no. No. No. No.
"
2,12,56,Katie:,"Hey, Robin. How are you?
"
2,12,57,Robin:,"Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?
"
2,12,58,Katie:,"Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.
"
2,12,59,Kyle:,"Looks like hotness runs in the family.
"
2,12,60,Robin:,"Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?
"
2,12,61,Katie:,"Two whole months.
"
2,12,62,Kyle:,"Yeah.
"
2,12,63,Katie:,"He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?
"
2,12,64,Kyle:,"My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...
"
2,12,65,Robin:,"That's cool. This is my friend Lily.
"
2,12,66,Kyle:,"Hot.
"
2,12,67,Robin:,"You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.
"
2,12,68,Katie:,"Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.
"
2,12,69,Robin:,"Uh, no, you're not.
"
2,12,70,Katie:,"Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.
"
2,12,71,Robin:,"What? Oh. Oh...
"
2,12,72,Robin :,"I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.
"
2,12,73,Marshall:,"Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.
"
2,12,74,Ted:,"Yeah, I don't have any of those.
"
2,12,75,Barney:,"Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.
"
2,12,76,Robin:,"Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.
"
2,12,77,Lily:,"It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.
"
2,12,78,Robin:,"That's why I need your help.
"
2,12,79,Ted (voix off):,"Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.
"
2,12,80,Ted:,"You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun
"
2,12,81,fact number one:,"When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.
"
2,12,82,Robin:,"You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.
"
2,12,83,Katie:,"Oh, here we go.
"
2,12,84,Lily:,"Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.
"
2,12,85,Marshall:,"Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.
"
2,12,86,Katie:,"You told them?
"
2,12,87,Robin:,"Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?
"
2,12,88,All:,"Totally. You should wait.
"
2,12,89,Barney:,"s*x is fun.
"
2,12,90,Robin:,"See?
"
2,12,91,Katie:,"You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.
"
2,12,92,Robin:,"Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.
"
2,12,93,Barney:,"I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.
"
2,12,94,Katie:,"Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...
"
2,12,95,Robin:,"Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.
"
2,12,96,Marshall:,"Even Kyle gets to do that.
"
2,12,97,Katie:,"You have no right to tell me not to do it.
"
2,12,98,Robin:,"But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.
"
2,12,99,Katie:,"Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.
"
2,12,100,Robin:,"You smoke now, too?
"
2,12,101,Lily:,"Oh, remember cloves?
"
2,12,102,Marshall:,"No!
"
2,12,103,Robin:,"No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.
"
2,12,104,Ted:,"Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.
"
2,12,105,Marshall:,"We were 18.
"
2,12,106,Ted:,"Barney was probably 12.
"
2,12,107,Barney:,"Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?
"
2,12,108,Ted:,"17.
"
2,12,109,Barney:,"Dude, me, too.
"
2,12,110,Lily:,"Barney, you okay?
"
2,12,111,Barney:,"Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...
"
2,12,112,Marshall:,"What camp?
"
2,12,113,Barney:,"This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.
"
2,12,114,Robin:,"What did you teach?
"
2,12,115,Barney:,"Uh, dance.
"
2,12,116,Ted:,"Dance?
"
2,12,117,Barney:,"Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.
"
2,12,118,Barney:,"Sylvia
"
2,12,119,Sylvia:,"Yes, Mickey?
"
2,12,120,Barney:,"How you call your loverboy?
"
2,12,121,Sylvia:,"Come here, loverboy
"
2,12,122,Barney:,"And if he doesn't answer
"
2,12,123,Sylvia:,"Oh, loverboy
"
2,12,124,Barney:,"And if he still doesn't answer?
"
2,12,125,Sylvia:,"I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby
"
2,12,126,Lily:,"That's Dirty Dancing.
"
2,12,127,Ted:,"It was on last night.
"
2,12,128,Marshall:,"No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!
"
2,12,129,Lily:,"Do you remember our first time?
"
2,12,130,Marshall:,"Yeah. It was back in college.
"
2,12,131,Lily:,"Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.
"
2,12,132,Marshall:,"Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.
"
2,12,133,Lily:,"Yeah, New Year's Eve.
"
2,12,134,Marshall:,"Okay.
"
2,12,135,Lily:,"Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.
"
2,12,136,Marshall:,"That's not a good idea.
"
2,12,137,Lily:,"Why not?
"
2,12,138,Marshall:,"Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.
"
2,12,139,Lily:,"Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later): Oops. End of flashback.
"
2,12,140,Robin:,"Oh, that's adorable.
"
2,12,141,Ted:,"Yeah, tell her what happened next.
"
2,12,142,Marshall:,"That was amazing.
"
2,12,143,Lily:,"Yeah. Want to do it again?
"
2,12,144,Ted (on the bed of the top):,"Please don't. End of flashback.
"
2,12,145,Marshall:,"We said we were sorry.
"
2,12,146,Ted:,"Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?
"
2,12,147,Marshall:,"You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.
"
2,12,148,Lily:,"The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.
"
2,12,149,Robin:,"Well, mine was terrible.
"
2,12,150,Lily:,"Wait, I've never heard your story.
"
2,12,151,Robin:,"Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.
"
2,12,152,Brian:,"Ready?
"
2,12,153,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
2,12,154,Brian:,"This feels so right.
"
2,12,155,Robin:,"Oh, I know.
"
2,12,156,Brian:,"Oh, Robin.
"
2,12,157,Robin:,"Oh, Brian.
"
2,12,158,Brian:,"Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback.
"
2,12,159,Lily:,"I'm so sorry.
"
2,12,160,Robin:,"Eh, I should've known. There were signs.
"
2,12,161,Brian:,"Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.
"
2,12,162,Robin:,"What?! Oh, my God!
"
2,12,163,Robin:,"You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.
"
2,12,164,Lily:,"What do you mean just barely?
"
2,12,165,Robin:,"Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.
"
2,12,166,Lily:," Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.
"
2,12,167,Robin:,"Yes, it does.
"
2,12,168,Lily:,"No, it doesn't.
"
2,12,169,Marshall:,"Yes, it does.
"
2,12,170,Lily:,"No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.
"
2,12,171,Barney:,"Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?
"
2,12,172,Marshall:,"No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?
"
2,12,173,Barney:,"Who's Scooter?
"
2,12,174,Lily:,"My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.
"
2,12,175,Marshall:,"I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""
"
2,12,176,Barney:,"No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""
"
2,12,177,Marshall:,"But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.
"
2,12,178,Katie:,"Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.
"
2,12,179,Ted:,"It's not stupid.
"
2,12,180,Katie:,"I'm going to see Kyle.
"
2,12,181,Robin:,"Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.
"
2,12,182,Katie:,"Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys.
"
2,12,183,Robin:,"It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.
"
2,12,184,Katie:,"I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.
"
2,12,185,Robin:,"I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.
"
2,12,186,Katie:,"Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?
"
2,12,187,Robin:,"I, um...
"
2,12,188,Ted:,"Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?
"
2,12,189,Robin:,"Just let me explain.
"
2,12,190,Ted:,"You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.
"
2,12,191,Robin:,"Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...
"
2,12,192,Ted:,"Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.
"
2,12,193,Robin:,"It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.
"
2,12,194,Ted:,"What, you mean like I did?
"
2,12,195,Robin:,"No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.
"
2,12,196,Ted:,"Weird... or courageous?
"
2,12,197,Robin:,"Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?
"
2,12,198,Ted:,"Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.
"
2,12,199,Robin:,"No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.
"
2,12,200,Ted:,"Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.
"
2,12,201,Robin:,"You... What?
"
2,12,202,Ted:,"I take my ""I love you"" back.
"
2,12,203,Robin:,"You can't take it back.
"
2,12,204,Ted:,"Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.
"
2,12,205,Man:,"Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted)
"
2,12,206,Lily:,"Marshall, why is this such a big deal?
"
2,12,207,Marshall:,"Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: ""One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did...
"
2,12,208,Lily:,"Okay, Marshall, I get it.
"
2,12,209,Marshall:,"It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.
"
2,12,210,Lily:,"No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.
"
2,12,211,Marshall:,"Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?
"
2,12,212,Marshall:,"Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.
"
2,12,213,Man:,"You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!
"
2,12,214,Robin:,"Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.
"
2,12,215,Katie:,"Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.
"
2,12,216,Robin:,"That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.
"
2,12,217,Ted (V.O.) :,"But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have s*x until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.
"
2,12,218,His kids:,"Dad!
"
2,12,219,The girl:,"Come on, what really happened?
"
2,12,220,Ted (V.O.):,"All right, here's what really happened.
"
2,12,221,Robin:,"Hey.
"
2,12,222,Ted:,"Hey.
"
2,12,223,Robin:,"She didn't do it.
"
2,12,224,Ted:,"Hey, that's great! You got through to her.
"
2,12,225,Robin:,"No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.
"
2,12,226,Ted:,"Hey, Katie.
"
2,12,227,Katie:,"Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?
"
2,12,228,Ted:,"No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?
"
2,12,229,Katie:,"I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.
"
2,12,230,Ted:,"That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.
"
2,12,231,Katie:,"Oh, really?
"
2,12,232,Ted:,"Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.
"
2,12,233,Molly:,"I love you, Ted.
"
2,12,234,Ted:,"Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (Voix off ) But I didn't.
"
2,12,235,Molly:,"That was amazing.
"
2,12,236,Ted:,"Look, I got to go.
"
2,12,237,Molly:,"Where are you going?
"
2,12,238,Ted:,"My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.
"
2,12,239,Molly:,"Well, will you call me?
"
2,12,240,Ted:,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (Voix off) But I didn't. Molly?
"
2,12,241,Molly:,"Yeah?
"
2,12,242,Ted:,"Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(Voix off) But I didn't.
"
2,12,243,Ted:,"And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.
"
2,12,244,Katie:,"So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.
"
2,12,245,Robin:,"Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?
"
2,12,246,Katie:,"Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.
"
2,12,247,Robin:,"Don't tell Mom.
"
2,12,248,Robin:,"Thanks for doing that.
"
2,12,249,Ted:,"You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.
"
2,12,250,Robin:,"But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.
"
2,12,251,Ted:,"Yeah, well...
"
2,12,252,Ted:,"I love you, Molly.
"
2,12,253,Molly:,"Oh, I love you, too, Ted.
"
2,12,254,Ted:,"Wow. That was amazing.
"
2,12,255,Molly:," Look, I got to go.
"
2,12,256,Ted:,"Wh-Where are you going?
"
2,12,257,Molly:,"Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome.
"
2,12,258,Ted:,"Will you call me?
"
2,12,259,Molly:,"Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted?
"
2,12,260,Ted:,"Yeah?
"
2,12,261,Molly:,"Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.
"
2,12,262,Ted:,"But she didn't.
"
2,12,263,Robin:,"Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.
"
2,12,264,Ted:,"I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.
"
2,12,265,Robin:,"Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.
"
2,12,266,Ted (voix off):,"Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.
"
2,12,267,Ted:,"I am so glad we're finally doing this.
"
2,12,268,Barney:,"What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.
"
2,12,269,Marshall:,"Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.
"
2,12,270,Lily:,"Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.
"
2,12,271,Marshall:,"Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other.
"
2,12,272,Lily:,"We've only had s*x with each other.
"
2,12,273,Barney:,"They've only had s*x with each other.
"
2,12,274,Ted:,"Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on!
"
2,12,275,Ted:,"So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?
"
2,12,276,Marshall:,"Well, we're usually busy... drinking.
"
2,12,277,Lily:,"Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.
"
2,12,278,Marshall:,"That's right, I almost forgot.
"
2,12,279,Barney:,"Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...
"
2,12,280,Marshall:,"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
"
2,12,281,Barney:,"I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...
"
2,12,282,Ted:,"Risky Business.
"
2,12,283,Barney:,"I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...
"
2,12,284,Ted:,"That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.
"
2,12,285,Barney:,"All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?
"
2,12,286,Marshall:,"Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.
"
2,12,287,Barney:,"Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.
"
2,12,288,Ted:,"Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
"
2,12,289,Barney:,"Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.
"
2,6,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.
"
2,6,2,Lily:,"It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.
"
2,6,3,Ted from 2030:,"And she did find it.
"
2,6,4,Lily (coming in Robin's):,"I'm going to be a life coach.
"
2,6,5,Ted from 2030:,"In fact, she found it again and again.
"
2,6,6,Lily:,"I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.
"
2,6,7,Robin (on the phone):,"Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.
"
2,6,8,Ted:,"What is she doing for money through all this?
"
2,6,9,Robin:,"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.
"
2,6,10,Ted:,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?
"
2,6,11,Robin:,"No.
"
2,6,12,Marshall:,"Here she comes. Here she comes.
"
2,6,13,Lily:,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.
"
2,6,14,Robin:,"I'm sorry.
"
2,6,15,Barney:,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her).
"
2,6,16,Lily:,"What do you want?
"
2,6,17,Ted:,"I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.
"
2,6,18,Lily:,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.
"
2,6,19,Barney:,"I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
"
2,6,20,Ted:,"No.
"
2,6,21,Lily:,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.
"
2,6,22,Ted:,"Robin, nothing to add?
"
2,6,23,Robin:,"No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.
"
2,6,24,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
2,6,25,Robin:,"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.
"
2,6,26,Marshall:,"I've never need the beer more than I do right now.
"
2,6,27,Ted:,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""
"
2,6,28,Marshall:,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.
"
2,6,29,Barney:,"Really? Laid, you say?
"
2,6,30,Marshall:,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.
"
2,6,31,Barney:,"She hot?
"
2,6,32,Marshall:,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.
"
2,6,33,Barney:,"And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
"
2,6,34,Robin:,"A what?
"
2,6,35,Barney:,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.
"
2,6,36,Ted:,"What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
"
2,6,37,Barney:,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.
"
2,6,38,Marshall:,"I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...
"
2,6,39,Barney:,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.
"
2,6,40,Lily (arriving):,"So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...
"
2,6,41,Marshall:,"Classic.
"
2,6,42,Robin:,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?
"
2,6,43,Ted:,"Yeah. Somebody did just quit.
"
2,6,44,Ted:,"So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)
"
2,6,45,Marshall:,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.
"
2,6,46,Ted:,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
"
2,6,47,Robin:,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.
"
2,6,48,Ted:,"It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
"
2,6,49,Barney:,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.
"
2,6,50,Ted:,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?
"
2,6,51,Lily:,"What would I be doing?
"
2,6,52,Ted:,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.
"
2,6,53,Ted:,"You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
"
2,6,54,Lily:,"Oh, right, is that the...?
"
2,6,55,Ted:,"Yeah. Here's the model.
"
2,6,56,Lily:,"You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.
"
2,6,57,Ted:,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.
"
2,6,58,Lily:,"How can he not see it? I mean there's the...
"
2,6,59,Ted:,"I know.
"
2,6,60,Lily:,"And the way it...
"
2,6,61,Ted:,"I know.
"
2,6,62,Lily:,"And the two little...
"
2,6,63,Ted:,"I know.
"
2,6,64,Lily:,"It is just...
"
2,6,65,Mr Druthers (arriving):,"Spectacular? Why, thank you.
"
2,6,66,Ted:,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.
"
2,6,67,Mr Druthers:,"Ah.
"
2,6,68,Lily:,"Nice to meet you.
"
2,6,69,Mr Druthers:,"Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?
"
2,6,70,Ted:,"I, uh... I am an architect.
"
2,6,71,Mr Druthers:,"Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?
"
2,6,72,Ted:,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.
"
2,6,73,Mr Druthers:,"Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?
"
2,6,74,Ted:,"Absolutely.
"
2,6,75,Mr Druthers:,"So you're going to design the...
"
2,6,76,Ted:,"Styrofoam trees.
"
2,6,77,Mr Druthers:,"Once again, with feeling.
"
2,6,78,Ted:,"Styrofoam trees.
"
2,6,79,Mr Druthers:,"Styrofoam trees!
"
2,6,80,Ted:,"Styrofoam trees!
"
2,6,81,Mr Druthers:,"That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)
"
2,6,82,Lily:,"Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)
"
2,6,83,Marshall:,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.
"
2,6,84,Barney:,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.
"
2,6,85,Marshall:,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.
"
2,6,86,Barney:,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?
"
2,6,87,Marshall:,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.
"
2,6,88,"Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent):","Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...
"
2,6,89,Pr Lewis:,"Tell me what you want or get out.
"
2,6,90,Barney:,"Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.
"
2,6,91,Pr Lewis:,"Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.
"
2,6,92,Lily:,"I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.
"
2,6,93,Ted:,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.
"
2,6,94,Robin:,"Did you show lily your design?
"
2,6,95,Ted:,"No.
"
2,6,96,Lily:,"What design?
"
2,6,97,Ted:,"It's nothing.
"
2,6,98,Robin:,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.
"
2,6,99,Lily:,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.
"
2,6,100,Ted:,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!
"
2,6,101,Barney:,"Oh, my god. Incredible.
"
2,6,102,Pr Lewis:,"Hmm... C minus.
"
2,6,103,Barney:,"C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!
"
2,6,104,Pr Lewis:,"You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.
"
2,6,105,Lily:,"Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.
"
2,6,106,Ted:,"Okay, I'm done.
"
2,6,107,Lily:,"Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.
"
2,6,108,Ted:,"Great. Thanks.
"
2,6,109,Mr Druthers:,"Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
"
2,6,110,Ted:,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.
"
2,6,111,Mr Druthers:,"Too green.
"
2,6,112,Ted:,"Too green?
"
2,6,113,Mr Druthers:,"Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?
"
2,6,114,Ted:,"I can't un-picture it.
"
2,6,115,Mr Druthers:,"Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!
"
2,6,116,Ted:,"What? What's gone?
"
2,6,117,Mr Druthers:,"My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
"
2,6,118,Ted:,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.
"
2,6,119,Mr Druthers:,"What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.
"
2,6,120,Ted:,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.
"
2,6,121,Mr Druthers:,"Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.
"
2,6,122,Ted:,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)
"
2,6,123,Lily:,"Hey.
"
2,6,124,Ted:,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?
"
2,6,125,Lily:,"That's easy. I took it.
"
2,6,126,Ted:,"Why?
"
2,6,127,Lily:,"It's simple.
"
2,6,128,[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers:,"I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university
"
2,6,129,Mr Druthers:,"Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.
"
2,6,130,Mr Druthers (to a kid):,"What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!
"
2,6,131,Lily:,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.
"
2,6,132,Ted:,"What does his ball have to do with anything?
"
2,6,133,Lily:,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.
"
2,6,134,Robin:,"Hey, guys. What's going on?
"
2,6,135,Ted:,"Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
"
2,6,136,Robin:,"Why? Was he being mean?
"
2,6,137,Ted:,"You know about this?
"
2,6,138,Robin:,"Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?
"
2,6,139,Lily:,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.
"
2,6,140,Robin:,"I gave them to you for your birthday.
"
2,6,141,Ted:,"So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
"
2,6,142,Lily:,"I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""
"
2,6,143,Ted:,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.
"
2,6,144,Lily:,"So is being mean.
"
2,6,145,Ted:,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.
"
2,6,146,Lily:,"Well, that's why I left a note.
"
2,6,147,Ted:,"A note?
"
2,6,148,Lily:,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.
"
2,6,149,Ted:,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.
"
2,6,150,Lily:,"I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.
"
2,6,151,Marshall:,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.
"
2,6,152,Barney:,"I know, I know.
"
2,6,153,Marshall:,"You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.
"
2,6,154,Barney:,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.
"
2,6,155,Marshall:,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.
"
2,6,156,Barney:,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.
"
2,6,157,Barney:,"I think I'm falling in love with you.
"
2,6,158,Pr Lewis:,"Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.
"
2,6,159,Barney:,"What? No.We had s*x yesterday.
"
2,6,160,Pr Lewis:,"Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.
"
2,6,161,Ted:,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.
"
2,6,162,Lily:,"No.
"
2,6,163,Ted:,"What do you mean, no?
"
2,6,164,Lily:,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.
"
2,6,165,Ted:,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.
"
2,6,166,Mr Druthers:,"Everybody get in here now!
"
2,6,167,Lily:,"""Who wants espresso?""
"
2,6,168,Mr Druthers:,"Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.
"
2,6,169,Lily:,"Interesting.
"
2,6,170,Mr Druthers:,"Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!
"
2,6,171,Lily:,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.
"
2,6,172,Ted:,"Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.
"
2,6,173,Lily:,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.
"
2,6,174,Ted:,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.
"
2,6,175,Lily:,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.
"
2,6,176,Ted:,"No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
"
2,6,177,Lily:,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.
"
2,6,178,Ted:,"Then you're fired.
"
2,6,179,Lily:,"Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.
"
2,6,180,Marshall:,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.
"
2,6,181,Barney:,"Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.
"
2,6,182,Marshall:,"So you're going back over there?
"
2,6,183,Barney:,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.
"
2,6,184,Barney:,"I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.
"
2,6,185,Pr Lewis:,"Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.
"
2,6,186,Barney:,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.
"
2,6,187,Pr Lewis:,"Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.
"
2,6,188,Mr Druthers:,"Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.
"
2,6,189,Ted:,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.
"
2,6,190,Mr Druthers:,"Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.
"
2,6,191,Ted:,"Lily was mentally deranged.
"
2,6,192,Mr Druthers:,"You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.
"
2,6,193,Ted:,"Lily was mentally deranged!
"
2,6,194,Mr Druthers:,"Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?
"
2,6,195,Man:,"The clients are here.
"
2,6,196,Mr Druthers:,"Excellent. Bring them in.
"
2,6,197,Ted from 2030:,"Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.
"
2,6,198,Mr Druthers:,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.
"
2,6,199,Client:,"That's a pen1s!
"
2,6,200,Mr Druthers:,"That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.
"
2,6,201,Client:,"We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?
"
2,6,202,Mr Druthers:,"Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.
"
2,6,203,Client:,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.
"
2,6,204,Ted from 2030:,"The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.
"
2,6,205,Ted:,"Wait! We have one more idea for you.
"
2,6,206,Mr Druthers:,"Ted, what are you doing?
"
2,6,207,Ted:,"I have another design.
"
2,6,208,Mr Druthers:,"Sit down, shut up right now.
"
2,6,209,Ted:,"No.
"
2,6,210,Robin:,"To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!
"
2,6,211,All:,"Probably!
"
2,6,212,Lily:,"Congrats, ted.
"
2,6,213,Ted:,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.
"
2,6,214,Lily:,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.
"
2,6,215,Ted:,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...
"
2,6,216,Lily:,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.
"
2,6,217,Lily:,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.
"
2,6,218,Robin:,"Barney! Oh, my god!
"
2,6,219,Ted:,"What happened?
"
2,6,220,Pr Lewis:,"He broke his hip.
"
2,6,221,Barney:,"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.
"
2,6,222,Pr Lewis:,"No, he's not fine.
"
2,6,223,Marshall:,"Professor Lewis, hi.
"
2,6,224,Pr Lewis:,"Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.
"
2,6,225,Barney:,"Yeah, she was.
"
2,6,226,Pr Lewis:,"B plus.
"
2,6,227,Barney:,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!
"
2,6,228,Marshall:,"Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
"
2,6,229,Barney:,"It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!
"
2,10,1,Ted (V.O.):,"Kids, there's nothing more wonderful than New York City in the winter... except the view of New York City in the winter through your apartment window.In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I were all deep in couple hibernation mode. Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold.
"
2,10,2,Barney:,"Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?
"
2,10,3,Ted:,"- Nope.
"
2,10,4,Robin:,"- No.
"
2,10,5,Barney:,"Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?
"
2,10,6,Ted:,"- Nope.
"
2,10,7,"Marshall, lily, Robin:","- No, thanks.
"
2,10,8,Barney:,"One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?
"
2,10,9,Marshall:,"Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.
"
2,10,10,Ted (voix off):,"It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.
"
2,10,11,Barney:," Hi. Have you met me?
"
2,10,12,Ted (voix off):,"Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements.
"
2,10,13,Tous:,"- No.
"
2,10,14,Barney:,"Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.
"
2,10,15,Tous:,"- Hey!
"
2,10,16,Robin:,"- You have a brother?
"
2,10,17,Barney:,"- Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever.
"
2,10,18,Lily:,"He's exactly like Barney.
"
2,10,19,Barney:,"That's what I just said.
"
2,10,20,Ted:,"Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay.
"
2,10,21,Robin:,"Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome.
"
2,10,22,Ted:,"Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.
"
2,10,23,James:,"What up, New York.
"
2,10,24,Robin:,"Thanks for the heads up.
"
2,10,25,Robin:,"How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?
"
2,10,26,Ted:,"Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.
"
2,10,27,Marshall:,"Yeah, so now the wedding's back on.
"
2,10,28,Lily:,"Anyway, James, how have you been?
"
2,10,29,James:,"Awesome, as per ""yoozh."" I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.""Legendarier."" And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped dead, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five.
"
2,10,30,Barney:,"Is ""gimme five"" back?
"
2,10,31,James:,"Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.
"
2,10,32,Barney:,"Guys, ""gimme five"" is back!
"
2,10,33,Ted:,"Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.
"
2,10,34,Robin:,"- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.
"
2,10,35,James:,"- You, too.
"
2,10,36,Robin:,"So, I have to ask, there's a story here.
"
2,10,37,Barney and James:,"Please.
"
2,10,38,Ted (voix off):,"The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years.
"
2,10,39,Mere:,"Well, boys, you look different because when I was pregnant with you, I only ate vanilla ice cream. And when I was pregnant with you, can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate?
"
2,10,40,James:,"- Coffee?
"
2,10,41,Mere:,"- No, James, I ate chocolate ice cream. But I did drink tons of coffee when I was pregnant with both of you. Can't smoke without my coffee.
"
2,10,42,Mere:,"I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things.
"
2,10,43,Mere:,"Stop asking me! You know what you two are? You're little racists!
"
2,10,44,Ted:,"So what are you guys gonna do tonight?
"
2,10,45,Barney:,"I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.
"
2,10,46,Ted:,"Okay.
"
2,10,47,Marshall:,"Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?
"
2,10,48,James:,"Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement. But I will say this: way more back hair than any guy who can afford laser hair removal should have.
"
2,10,49,Lily:,"And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.
"
2,10,50,Barney:,"It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.
"
2,10,51,James:," He was a little bit way into black guys.
"
2,10,52,Tes (voix off):,"Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination. Since there was never any crossover in targets, James was always there for Barney with the assist.
"
2,10,53,James:,"Whoa. Your scarf... it is fierce!
"
2,10,54,Women:,"Thanks. H & M.
"
2,10,55,James:,"What? I would never know, 'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see. Hey! You know, speaking of things that would look good wrapped around you, have you met my straight brother, Barney? Oh, he is fab--don't you go nowhere-- ""ulous."" Okay?
"
2,10,56,Ted (voix off):,"And Barney always returned the favor.
"
2,10,57,Barney:,"Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?
"
2,10,58,Man:,"Oh, my God, I do!
"
2,10,59,Barney:," Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?
"
2,10,60,Barney:,"Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.
"
2,10,61,James:,"You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?
"
2,10,62,Ted:,"- No.
"
2,10,63,Lily:,"- Jammies.
"
2,10,64,Marshall:,"Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...I have warm soup belly.
"
2,10,65,James:,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys... you are young, attractive people here in the greatest city on earth. There are boys and girls in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here. But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement. You owe it to them to rise up and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot, and you go out there and you live their dream!- Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?
"
2,10,66,Tous:,"- Hell, yeah!
"
2,10,67,James:,"Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?
"
2,10,68,Tous:,"- Hell, yeah!
"
2,10,69,James:,"Can I get a ""woo-woo""?
"
2,10,70,Tous:,"- Woo-woo!
"
2,10,71,James:,"Go do it for Wyoming!
"
2,10,72,Tous:,"Yes!
"
2,10,73,James:,"Testify!
"
2,10,74,Ted (voix off):,"So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out.
"
2,10,75,Barney:,"Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?
"
2,10,76,James:,"Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man.
"
2,10,77,Barney:,"I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?
"
2,10,78,James:,"Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?
"
2,10,79,Barney:,"- Let's ride.
"
2,10,80,James:,"- Fo' 'sho. Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!
"
2,10,81,Women:,"- Get off me, you pig!
"
2,10,82,Barney:,"- Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.
"
2,10,83,James:,"- What? What?
"
2,10,84,Barney:,"- What? What?
"
2,10,85,James:,"Cool.
"
2,10,86,Barney:,"Let me know if he bothers you again.
"
2,10,87,Women:,"Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.
"
2,10,88,Barney:,"Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.
"
2,10,89,Ted (voix off):,"Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs.
"
2,10,90,James:,"- Break.
"
2,10,91,Barney:,"- Boiling hot.
"
2,10,92,Ted (voix off):,"Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.
"
2,10,93,James:,"- Hey! - Hi, how are ya?
"
2,10,94,James and Barney:,"Have you met my brother?
"
2,10,95,Barney:,"Oh, hello. Have a drink.
"
2,10,96,James:,"Nice to meet ya.
"
2,10,97,Ted (voix off):,"Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma.
"
2,10,98,James:,"I wish I would've worn sneakers. I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy who was periscoping out of his pleather pants. Permission to come aboard denied.
"
2,10,99,Lily:,"I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this.
"
2,10,100,Robin:,"Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.
"
2,10,101,Lily:,"Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo.
"
2,10,102,Man:,"Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe?
"
2,10,103,Lily:,"Oh, please go sweat on someone else.
"
2,10,104,Marshall:,"Poor guy.
"
2,10,105,Lily:,"Poor guy? Poor my boobs.
"
2,10,106,Marshall:,"Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him.
"
2,10,107,Lily:,"Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside.
"
2,10,108,Robin:,"Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end.
"
2,10,109,Ted:,"""Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have s*x with me."" Waa.
"
2,10,110,Marshall:,"""Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but can't order because they'll be made fun of.""
"
2,10,111,Ted:,"- Dude.
"
2,10,112,Marshall:,"- They're delicious!
"
2,10,113,Man:,"Excuse me. Join me in a shot?
"
2,10,114,James:,"Oh, no thanks. I've had enough. He's too in shape, we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it... because I can.
"
2,10,115,Lily:,"You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight.
"
2,10,116,Marshall:,"Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are.
"
2,10,117,Ted:,"He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?
"
2,10,118,Robin:,"No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.
"
2,10,119,Marshall:,"Look at that. He's texting!
"
2,10,120,Ted:,"Oh, my God! He is in a couple.
"
2,10,121,Lily:,"This is gonna kill Barney.
"
2,10,122,Barney:,"What's gonna kill me? What's going on?
"
2,10,123,Marshall:,"B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?
"
2,10,124,Barney:,"No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.
"
2,10,125,Ted:,"We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.
"
2,10,126,Barney:,"That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall.
"
2,10,127,Robin:,"And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.
"
2,10,128,Barney:,"No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex...
"
2,10,129,James:,"Hey, bro.
"
2,10,130,Barney:,"Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.
"
2,10,131,James:,"Why?
"
2,10,132,Barney:,"I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.
"
2,10,133,James:,"No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?
"
2,10,134,Barney:,"I got... Who is this? And the answer better be: ""I don't remember his name.""
"
2,10,135,James:,"That is Tom. And he's my fianc√©.
"
2,10,136,James:,"Hey.
"
2,10,137,Barney:,"I don't support this.
"
2,10,138,James:,"Gay marriage?
"
2,10,139,Barney:,"Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!
"
2,10,140,James:,"Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.
"
2,10,141,Barney:,"Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.
"
2,10,142,James:,"Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man.
"
2,10,143,Barney:,"What? No way.
"
2,10,144,James:,"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind.
"
2,10,145,Woman:,"Two beers, one shot.
"
2,10,146,Barney:,"Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.
"
2,10,147,Lily:,"Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?
"
2,10,148,Marshall:,"Yes.
"
2,10,149,Barney:,"Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.
"
2,10,150,Ted:,"I don't get manicures.
"
2,10,151,Barney:,"Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.
"
2,10,152,Lily:,"You get your chest waxed?
"
2,10,153,Barney:,"You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.
"
2,10,154,Marshall:,"Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.
"
2,10,155,Barney:,"No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom.
"
2,10,156,Marshall:,"Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.
"
2,10,157,Barney:,"Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.
"
2,10,158,Ted:,"Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.
"
2,10,159,Barney:,"You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make.
"
2,10,160,James:,"Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?
"
2,10,161,Barney:,"What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.
"
2,10,162,Marshall:,"Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.
"
2,10,163,Man:,"Hey. You work out?
"
2,10,164,Marshall:,"I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.
"
2,10,165,Man:,"Well, I try. So you want to dance?
"
2,10,166,Marshall:,"You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fianc√©e.
"
2,10,167,Man:,"I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...
"
2,10,168,Marshall:,"No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.
"
2,10,169,Lily:,"No, it isn't.
"
2,10,170,Man:,"Whatever. How 'bout you?
"
2,10,171,Ted:,"Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.
"
2,10,172,Marshall:,"You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.
"
2,10,173,Man:,"Hey, I really like your sweater.
"
2,10,174,Robin:,"Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything.
"
2,10,175,Man:,"My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?
"
2,10,176,Robin:,"I love this place! Let's dance!
"
2,10,177,Lily:," - And not be groped!
"
2,10,178,Robin:,"- Whoo! Thank you.
"
2,10,179,Ted:,"- Thank you!
"
2,10,180,Marshall:,"- We're hot.
"
2,10,181,Ted:,"- Totally.
"
2,10,182,James:," And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!
"
2,10,183,Barney:,"Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.
"
2,10,184,James:,"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.
"
2,10,185,Barney:,"And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?
"
2,10,186,James:,"Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.
"
2,10,187,Barney:,"Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?
"
2,10,188,James:,"Please.
"
2,10,189,Barney:,"He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!
"
2,10,190,Marshall:,"I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.
"
2,10,191,Ted:,"Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.
"
2,10,192,Man:,"Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!
"
2,10,193,Marshall:,"Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...
"
2,10,194,Man:,"Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?
"
2,10,195,Ted:,"God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?
"
2,10,196,Robin:,"How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?
"
2,10,197,Marshall:,"That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,
"
2,10,198,Ted:,"And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!
"
2,10,199,Lily:,"Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?
"
2,10,200,Robin:,"Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.
"
2,10,201,Barney:,"James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.
"
2,10,202,James:,"Barney.
"
2,10,203,Barney:,"So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...
"
2,10,204,James:,"Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married.
"
2,10,205,Charles:,"Wow.- Best of luck to you both.
"
2,10,206,James:,"- Thank you.
"
2,10,207,Charles:,"My number's in here. I'm very discreet.
"
2,10,208,James:,"Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...
"
2,10,209,Barney:,"Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?
"
2,10,210,James:,"To get laid.
"
2,10,211,Barney:,"To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!
"
2,10,212,James:,"- Yes, I do.
"
2,10,213,Barney:,"- Why?!
"
2,10,214,James:,"Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.
"
2,10,215,Barney:,"What? There's gonna be a baby?
"
2,10,216,James:,"Yes. We're adopting.
"
2,10,217,Barney:,"Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?
"
2,10,218,James:,"For the rest of your life.
"
2,10,219,Barney:,"To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.
"
2,10,220,Tous:,"- Cheers.
"
2,10,221,Barney:,"Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to
"
2,10,222,Lily:,"It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.
"
2,10,223,Marshall:,"Whoa. It's 9:00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?
"
2,10,224,Ted:,"Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.
"
2,10,225,Robin:,"Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.
"
2,10,226,Marshall:,"All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.
"
2,10,227,Lily:,"Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.
"
2,10,228,Barney:,"Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.
"
2,10,229,Barney:,"- May I?
"
2,10,230,James:,"- Yeah.
"
2,10,231,Barney:,"Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?
"
2,10,232,Rosa:,"I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?
"
2,10,233,Barney:,"Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...
"
2,4,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is.
"
2,4,2,Ted:,"Well, we just had our first fight.
"
2,4,3,Robin:,"We had our first fight.
"
2,4,4,Barney:,"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? (He puts his headphones on).
"
2,4,5,Ted:,"A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...
"
2,4,6,Robin:,"It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.
"
2,4,7,Ted:,"And if we don't get it, we could go under.
"
2,4,8,Robin:,"So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.
"
2,4,9,Both Marshall and Barney:,"No.
"
2,4,10,Ted:,"Yes.
"
2,4,11,Marshall:,"Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...
"
2,4,12,Ted:,"Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.
"
2,4,13,Marshall:,"Wow, so it's the whole package.
"
2,4,14,Barney:,"Yeah, you did.
"
2,4,15,Marshall:,"Had to.
"
2,4,16,Barney:,"Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.
"
2,4,17,Marshall:,"Yeah, you did.
"
2,4,18,Barney:,"Had to.
"
2,4,19,Ted:,"It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.
"
2,4,20,Marshall:,"Yeah, you did.
"
2,4,21,Ted:,"That wasn't one.
"
2,4,22,Lily:,"So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.
"
2,4,23,Robin:,"Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.
"
2,4,24,Lily:,"Ooh, two tragedies in one day.
"
2,4,25,Robin:,"The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.
"
2,4,26,Ted:,"Hey.
"
2,4,27,Robin:,"Hey.
"
2,4,28,Ted:,"How was your day?
"
2,4,29,Robin:,"Good.
"
2,4,30,Ted:,"Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?
"
2,4,31,Robin:,"No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?
"
2,4,32,Ted:,"You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.
"
2,4,33,Robin:,"Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.
"
2,4,34,Lily:,"Robin!
"
2,4,35,Robin:,"What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.
"
2,4,36,Lily:,"You should work at a suicide hotline.
"
2,4,37,Robin:,"And then it got ugly.
"
2,4,38,Robin:,"What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.
"
2,4,39,Ted:,"So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?
"
2,4,40,Robin:,"It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.
"
2,4,41,Robin:,"So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.
"
2,4,42,Lily:,"Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.
"
2,4,43,Ted:,"How do you not like Field of Dreams?!
"
2,4,44,Lily:,"Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.
"
2,4,45,Robin:,"I guess I don't know how to do that.
"
2,4,46,Lily:,"Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.
"
2,4,47,Robin:,"No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?
"
2,4,48,Lily:,"What the hell comes before ""Q""?
"
2,4,49,Ted:,"Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.
"
2,4,50,Barney (brokenly):,"Can we talk about something else?
"
2,4,51,Marshall:,"You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.
"
2,4,52,Barney:,"Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?
"
2,4,53,Marshall:,"That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.
"
2,4,54,Barney:,"Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.
"
2,4,55,Ted:,"I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.
"
2,4,56,Marshall:,"Your job's not boring.
"
2,4,57,Ted:,"Robin thinks so.
"
2,4,58,Barney:,"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.
"
2,4,59,Ted:,"I love it when you quote Scripture.
"
2,4,60,Barney:,"I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.
"
2,4,61,Ted:,"Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.
"
2,4,62,Barney:,"That's 'cause you're always like... (Dully) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like... (Confidently) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.
"
2,4,63,Marshall (suavely):,"Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..
"
2,4,64,Barney:,"Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me.
"
2,4,65,Ted:,"Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?
"
2,4,66,Girl:,"Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?
"
2,4,67,Ted:,"Solid point. She did have hair of gold.
"
2,4,68,Girl:,"Yes, she did.
"
2,4,69,Ted:,"Mm-hmm.
"
2,4,70,Robin:,"Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?
"
2,4,71,Carl:,"No. Hey, Lily. You still single?
"
2,4,72,Lily:,"Yes.
"
2,4,73,Carl:,"You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.
"
2,4,74,Lily:,"Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?
"
2,4,75,Carl:,"Only if you're into it. It's on me.
"
2,4,76,Lily:,"Thanks.
"
2,4,77,Robin:,"I wonder where Ted went.
"
2,4,78,A girl:,"Ted Mosby, the architect?
"
2,4,79,Robin:,"Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.
"
2,4,80,Girl 1:,"And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?
"
2,4,81,Ted:,"Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.
"
2,4,82,Girl 1:,"I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me.
"
2,4,83,Ted:,"Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?
"
2,4,84,Girls:,"Yeah.
"
2,4,85,Lily:,"He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?
"
2,4,86,Robin:,"Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.
"
2,4,87,Lily:,"What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.
"
2,4,88,Robin:,"I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.
"
2,4,89,Girl:,"She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.
"
2,4,90,Robin:,"All right, we'll swing by the party.
"
2,4,91,Ted from 2030:,"Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however...
"
2,4,92,Robin:,"Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.
"
2,4,93,Guy 1:,"Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!
"
2,4,94,Ted from 2030:,"That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.
"
2,4,95,Lily:,"Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?
"
2,4,96,Guy 2:,"Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!
"
2,4,97,Robin:,"Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.
"
2,4,98,Guy 2:,"You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here.
"
2,4,99,Ted:,"Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.
"
2,4,100,Girl:,"Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.
"
2,4,101,Ted:,"I know you would. It's the job.
"
2,4,102,Guy 2 (to guy 1):,"Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight.
"
2,4,103,Guy 1:,"No way.
"
2,4,104,Girl 2:,"Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?
"
2,4,105,Marshall:,"I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.
"
2,4,106,Guy 2:,"Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move.
"
2,4,107,Marshall:,"Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.
"
2,4,108,Girl 2:,"And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days.
"
2,4,109,Marshall:,"Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.
"
2,4,110,Girl 2:,"You should sue her.
"
2,4,111,Marshall:,"Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?
"
2,4,112,Kara:,"On the grounds of... shut up.
"
2,4,113,Ted from 2030:,"That's our Attorney General.
"
2,4,114,Lily:,"See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.
"
2,4,115,Robin:,"Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?
"
2,4,116,Guy 2:,"The girl with the smackable ass.
"
2,4,117,Robin:,"Yes, that's the young lady.
"
2,4,118,Girl:,"So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing?
"
2,4,119,Robin:,"Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.
"
2,4,120,Ted:,"Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.
"
2,4,121,Girl:,"Yay!
"
2,4,122,Ted:,"Wait, let me just check with my friend.
"
2,4,123,Girl:,"Okay.
"
2,4,124,Ted:,"Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?
"
2,4,125,Marshall:,"Um... only always.
"
2,4,126,Ted:,"Let's go.
"
2,4,127,Robin:,"Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.
"
2,4,128,Lily:,"Did you grow up in that Footloose town?
"
2,4,129,Robin:,"I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.
"
2,4,130,Lily:,"Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.
"
2,4,131,Robin:,"He's not answering. Calling Marshall.
"
2,4,132,Marshall:,"Hello.
"
2,4,133,Robin:,"Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?
"
2,4,134,Marshall:,"Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.
"
2,4,135,Robin:,"Uh, okay. Bye. (She hangs up) Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.
"
2,4,136,Robin:,"Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd.
"
2,4,137,Bouncer:,"You're going to need to refresh my memory.
"
2,4,138,Lily:,"Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?
"
2,4,139,Bouncer:,"Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory.
"
2,4,140,Lily:,"Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.
"
2,4,141,Robin:,"So these guys... One of them's an architect.
"
2,4,142,Bouncer:,"Ted Mosby, the architect?
"
2,4,143,Robin:,"That's the one.
"
2,4,144,Bouncer:,"Oh, yeah, he was here.
"
2,4,145,Ted:,"And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.
"
2,4,146,Girl:,"I live across the street.
"
2,4,147,Ted:,"That is one hell of a non sequitur.
"
2,4,148,Girl:,"You want to come over?
"
2,4,149,Ted:,"Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. (The girl jumps on Ted's back)
"
2,4,150,Girl (to the bouncer):,"I'll see you at book club, Vinny.
"
2,4,151,Bouncer:,"Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudit√©s.
"
2,4,152,Girl:,"Nice. Giddy up!
"
2,4,153,Marshall:,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?
"
2,4,154,Ted:,"Galloping.
"
2,4,155,Marshall:,"You proved it, all right? The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" things works.
"
2,4,156,Girl:,"Architects rule! Whoo-hee!
"
2,4,157,Marshall:,"Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.
"
2,4,158,Ted:,"It is tonight. Whoo!
"
2,4,159,Robin:,"You know this girl. Where does she live?
"
2,4,160,Bouncer:,"I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.
"
2,4,161,Lily:,"Well, I'm out of money.
"
2,4,162,Robin:,"I'm cashed, too.
"
2,4,163,Bouncer:,"I'll take your purse.
"
2,4,164,Robin:,"My purse?
"
2,4,165,Bouncer:,"Yeah, my girl likes clutches.
"
2,4,166,Robin:,"Okay, fine.
"
2,4,167,Lily:,"You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.
"
2,4,168,Robin:,"Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?
"
2,4,169,Bouncer:,"The building with the green light, apartment 3-C.
"
2,4,170,Lily:,"Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?
"
2,4,171,Robin:,"Yeah... And steal her purse.
"
2,4,172,Robin:,"I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.
"
2,4,173,Lily:,"3-C, let's do this. You ready?
"
2,4,174,Robin:,"Should I just kick the door in?
"
2,4,175,Lily:,"Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?
"
2,4,176,Robin:,"I'm the problem.
"
2,4,177,Lily:,"What?
"
2,4,178,Robin:,"You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.
"
2,4,179,Lily:,"Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.
"
2,4,180,Robin:,"Let's do this.
"
2,4,181,Lily:,"Bring it. (They come in)
"
2,4,182,Robin:,"What do you think you're...? Barney?
"
2,4,183,Barney (tied up to the bed):,"Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.
"
2,4,184,Robin:,"Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?
"
2,4,185,Barney:,"Ted? He's at work.
"
2,4,186,Robin:,"How did you get here?
"
2,4,187,Barney:,"Awesome story. As per usual.
"
2,4,188,Girl:,"How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?
"
2,4,189,Ted:,"Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.
"
2,4,190,Girl:,"Yes, she did.
"
2,4,191,Barney (coming back in the bar):,"Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.
"
2,4,192,Ted:,"Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.
"
2,4,193,Girl:,"Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.
"
2,4,194,Barney:,"Yeah, stay (mouthing ""go"")
"
2,4,195,Ted:,"Excuse us for one second. (To Barney) Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.
"
2,4,196,Barney:,"Yeah, you did.
"
2,4,197,Ted:,"Yeah, had to. See ya. (He leaves)
"
2,4,198,Barney (to the girl):,"Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.
"
2,4,199,Girl:,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.
"
2,4,200,Barney:,"Ted Mosby... Architect.
"
2,4,201,Barney:,"But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.
"
2,4,202,Anna:,"Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!
"
2,4,203,Marshall:,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?
"
2,4,204,Barney:,"Galloping.
"
2,4,205,Marshall:,"All right, you proved it. The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" thing works.
"
2,4,206,Anna:,"Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.
"
2,4,207,Marshall:,"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.
"
2,4,208,Barney:,"It is tonight.
"
2,4,209,Barney:,"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.
"
2,4,210,Robin:,"But why would you use Ted's name?
"
2,4,211,Barney:,"I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing.
"
2,4,212,Lily:,"Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.
"
2,4,213,Robin:,"Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.
"
2,4,214,Lily:,"This is how people act in relationships.
"
2,4,215,Robin:,"And that's why I avoid relationships.
"
2,4,216,Lily:,"Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.
"
2,4,217,Barney:,"And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.
"
2,4,218,Robin:,"You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?
"
2,4,219,Barney:,"I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a ""A."" A... A... I'll just put ""resident."" Go, go, go, go.
"
2,4,220,Ted from 2030:,"Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.
"
2,4,221,Robin:,"Hey.
"
2,4,222,Ted:,"Hey. What are you doing here?
"
2,4,223,Robin:,"I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.
"
2,4,224,Ted:,"Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?
"
2,4,225,Robin:,"It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?
"
2,4,226,Ted:,"You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?
"
2,4,227,Robin:,"Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through.
"
2,4,228,Ted:,"What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.
"
2,4,229,Robin:,"Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?
"
2,4,230,Ted:,"Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?
"
2,4,231,Robin:,"Obviously. Wow.
"
2,4,232,Ted:,"Yes.
"
2,4,233,Robin:,"You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.
"
2,4,234,Ted:,"You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?
"
2,4,235,Ted from 2030:,"You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it.
"
2,4,236,Robin:,"Wow. Ted, this is amazing.
"
2,4,237,Ted:,"Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.
"
2,4,238,Robin:,"I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. (They kiss)
"
2,4,239,Ted:,"Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. (They kiss again)
"
2,4,240,Anna's apartment. Anna's reading the letter Barney left.Barney's voice:,"""Dear Resident... The time we spent together, however long it was, meant the world to me. I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident. Perhaps we will meet again in another decade, provided you keep your figure. Until then, all my love from the beyond. Barney.""
"
2,4,241,Anna:,"Barney? Who the hell is Barney?
"
2,5,1,Ted (from 2030):,"Your Uncle Barney was always a bit of an enigma. In all the years we lived in new york, none of us had ever set foot in his apartment. Until one day, one of us did.
"
2,5,2,Barney:,"Aaaaaaah!
"
2,5,3,Lily:,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"
2,5,4,Ted (from 2030):,"It's a pretty good story. And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role. It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming.
"
2,5,5,Lily:,"Welcome to my new home.
"
2,5,6,Ted:,"Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it.
"
2,5,7,Lily:,"Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice.
"
2,5,8,Ted:,"Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?
"
2,5,9,Robin:,"Or a stove in your bathroom?
"
2,5,10,Lily:,"Oh, that's not just a stove. That's a stovenkerator: a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator. Stovenkerator. Isn't that futuristic?
"
2,5,11,Ted:,"God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.
"
2,5,12,Lily:,"It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...
"
2,5,13,Robin:,"Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason.
"
2,5,14,Ted:,"Hold on, I got it.
"
2,5,15,Lily:,"That was ""something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.
"
2,5,16,Robin:,"Uh. Other cultures!
"
2,5,17,Lily:,"Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...? (Mouse squeaking) Aaaaaah!
"
2,5,18,Ted:,"Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.
"
2,5,19,Robin:,"I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.
"
2,5,20,Ted:,"Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.
"
2,5,21,Robin:,"What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.
"
2,5,22,Barney:,"The fortress of barnitude? No way.
"
2,5,23,Robin:,"Come on. She's desperate.
"
2,5,24,Barney:,"Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.
"
2,5,25,Marshall (arriving):,"One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have... A boom! An extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?
"
2,5,26,Robin:,"Absolutely not.
"
2,5,27,Ted:,"No.
"
2,5,28,Marshall:,"Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch!
"
2,5,29,Ted:,"Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.
"
2,5,30,Marshall:,"Oh, you don't think I've tried?
"
2,5,31,Marshall:,"Table for one.
"
2,5,32,Head waiter:,"One... Couple?
"
2,5,33,Marshall:,"Um, no, just me.
"
2,5,34,Head waiter:,"Really? For brunch?
"
2,5,35,Marshall:,"You're right. Who am I kidding?
"
2,5,36,Robin:,"Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?
"
2,5,37,Ted:,"Of course, sweetie.
"
2,5,38,Marshall:,"Can I go with you guys?
"
2,5,39,Ted:,"Really? For brunch?
"
2,5,40,Marshall:,"God, I hate being single!
"
2,5,41,At Barney's apartment.Barney (on the phone):,"Okay,I'll take the over on the Pittsburgh game. Oh and P. to the S., I never got my payout from Seattle from two weeks ago. Yeah. Don't make me call the gaming commission on you. I'm sure they'd be very interested to know what's going on over there. All right? All right? Okay, I love you too Mom. Take care. (He hangs up) Hello Lily. You've somehow managed to circumvent my security. How did you do it?
"
2,5,42,Lily:,"Ted gave me your spare key.
"
2,5,43,Ted:,"Spare key! Brilliant!
"
2,5,44,Lily:,"I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...
"
2,5,45,[FLASHBACK. Lily tries to spread out her bed and the wall collapses]Lily (to her Lithuanian neighbor):,"Sveikas (=Hello)
"
2,5,46,Barney:,"That's terrible. Well, see ya.
"
2,5,47,Lily:,"Wait, can I stay here maybe?
"
2,5,48,Barney:,"I'd let you, but I don't have any room.
"
2,5,49,Lily:,"You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.
"
2,5,50,Barney:,"Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a s*x visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.
"
2,5,51,Lily:,"Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.
"
2,5,52,Barney:,"Wow, you really are desperate.
"
2,5,53,Lily:,"I really am.
"
2,5,54,Barney:,"Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.
"
2,5,55,Lily:,"Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.
"
2,5,56,Barney:,"See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.
"
2,5,57,Lily:,"It hurts my eyes.
"
2,5,58,Barney:,"Yeah. That doesn't go away.
"
2,5,59,Ted:,"Hey, where have you been?
"
2,5,60,Marshall:,"The Alanis Morissette concert.
"
2,5,61,Ted:,"By yourself?
"
2,5,62,Marshall:,"No,actually I went with a friend from law school.
"
2,5,63,Robin:,"Oh,really? Who's this friend?
"
2,5,64,Marshall:,"Brad.
"
2,5,65,Brad:,"Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!
"
2,5,66,Marshall:,"Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.
"
2,5,67,Brad:,"Let me guess: you bought the tickets for you and Lily right before she dumped you.
"
2,5,68,Marshall:,"Yeah, how'd you know?
"
2,5,69,Brad:,"I just got dumped myself.
"
2,5,70,Marshall:,"What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?
"
2,5,71,Ted:,"You invited him to brunch?
"
2,5,72,Marshall:,"Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?
"
2,5,73,Ted:,"Yes. That's why I was all ""you invited him to brunch?""
"
2,5,74,Marshall:,"Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?
"
2,5,75,Ted:,"Because brunch is kind of...
"
2,5,76,Robin:,"Girly.
"
2,5,77,Marshall:,"Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?
"
2,5,78,Ted:,"I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.
"
2,5,79,Marshall:,"I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.
"
2,5,80,Barney:,"Uhm, smells delicious.
"
2,5,81,Lily:,"Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up... (Barney puts the breakfast in the trash) What are you doing?
"
2,5,82,Barney:,"Lily, what was the first rule again?
"
2,5,83,Lily:,"""Don't change anything""?
"
2,5,84,Barney:,"And what was the second rule?
"
2,5,85,Lily:,"There was no second rule.
"
2,5,86,Barney:,"Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.
"
2,5,87,Lily:,"I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?
"
2,5,88,Barney:,"Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says ""our work here is done."" Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de gr&acirc;ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn...
"
2,5,89,Lily:,"Marshall doesn't have p0rn.
"
2,5,90,Barney:,"Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.
"
2,5,91,Lily:,"And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.
"
2,5,92,Barney:,"No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.
"
2,5,93,Marshall:,"God, I love brunch.
"
2,5,94,Brad:,"Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous.
"
2,5,95,Marshall:,"This isn't weird, right?
"
2,5,96,Brad:,"I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny.
"
2,5,97,Marshall:,"Right? Right?
"
2,5,98,Brad:,"I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?
"
2,5,99,Marshall:,"Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.
"
2,5,100,Brad:,"This must be destiny.
"
2,5,101,Marshall:,"What are you talking about?
"
2,5,102,Brad:,"I have two tickets for Mamma Mia! friday night. You like Abba, right? What am I saying?Who doesn't? Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me. We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say?
"
2,5,103,Marshall:,"Yeah!
"
2,5,104,Barney:,"Hey. Did the cold wake you?
"
2,5,105,Girl:,"No,I've just been watching you sleep.
"
2,5,106,Barney:,"Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.
"
2,5,107,Girl:,"I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.
"
2,5,108,Barney:,"Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...
"
2,5,109,Girl:,"I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day.
"
2,5,110,Barney:,"I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look (he shows her his p0rn) Oh, I'm disgusting.
"
2,5,111,Girl:,"Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you.
"
2,5,112,Barney:,"Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um...
"
2,5,113,Lily (walking in):,"Barney... Oh!
"
2,5,114,Girl:,"Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?
"
2,5,115,Barney:,"What? No. Yes!
"
2,5,116,Girl:,"Yes?
"
2,5,117,Barney:,"Yes.
"
2,5,118,Girl:,"You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.
"
2,5,119,Barney:,"Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...? (The girl is gone. To Lily) You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.
"
2,5,120,Lily:,"Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?
"
2,5,121,Barney:,"She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p0rn.
"
2,5,122,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
2,5,123,Barney:,"How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...
"
2,5,124,Lily:,"I'll do it.
"
2,5,125,Barney:,"Really?
"
2,5,126,Lily:,"Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.
"
2,5,127,Barney:,"I'll take it.
"
2,5,128,At MacLaren's:,
2,5,129,Ted:,"Mamma mia!?
"
2,5,130,Marshall:,"Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff.
"
2,5,131,Ted:,"No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.
"
2,5,132,Robin:,"Ooh, third date. You know what that means.
"
2,5,133,Marshall:,"It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.
"
2,5,134,Ted:,"You bros going to get dinner beforehand?
"
2,5,135,Marshall:,"We might grab a steak, yeah.
"
2,5,136,Ted:,"Where at?
"
2,5,137,Marshall:,"Caf√© l'amour. (Ted and Robin laugh) Brad says the food is really good there, okay?
"
2,5,138,Robin:,"Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your ""A"" game. That means no granny panties.
"
2,5,139,Marshall:,"All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.
"
2,5,140,Ted:,"What are you going to wear?
"
2,5,141,Marshall:,"I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin... (Ted and Robin laugh) Oh, you know what? Shut up.
"
2,5,142,Barney:,"Can you pass the arts and leisure? (The girl does it. More loudly) Can you pass the arts and leisure?
"
2,5,143,Girl:,"I just did.
"
2,5,144,Lily (walking in):,"Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?
"
2,5,145,Barney:,"Lily, I can explain...
"
2,5,146,Lily:,"How could you? In our own home? (She slaps him) You b*st*rd!
"
2,5,147,Girl:,"I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...
"
2,5,148,Lily:,"Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I... (The girl is gone) I was just about to turn on the tears.
"
2,5,149,Barney:,"Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.
"
2,5,150,Lily:,"Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.
"
2,5,151,Barney:,"Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.
"
2,5,152,Lily:,"You know... Oh nah, never mind.
"
2,5,153,Barney:,"What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.
"
2,5,154,Lily:,"Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.
"
2,5,155,Barney:,"What did you have in mind?
"
2,5,156,Ted:,"Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.
"
2,5,157,Marshall:,"Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.
"
2,5,158,Marshall:,"Oh, you really don't have to do that.
"
2,5,159,Brad:,"No, I insist. You're my guest.
"
2,5,160,Marshall:,"Thanks, Brad.
"
2,5,161,Brad:,"Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. (He licks his serviette and cleans Marshall's chin)
"
2,5,162,Ted:,"Woah!
"
2,5,163,Robin:,"Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.
"
2,5,164,Marshall:,"It gets worse.
"
2,5,165,Marshall:,"No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.
"
2,5,166,Brad:,"So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come?
"
2,5,167,Marshall:,"You want me to go to a wedding with you?
"
2,5,168,Ted:,"Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers"".
"
2,5,169,Robin:,"Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.
"
2,5,170,Marshall:,"It gets worse.
"
2,5,171,Brad:,"It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.
"
2,5,172,Marshall:,"Vermont?
"
2,5,173,Brad:,"Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro.
"
2,5,174,Ted:,"You said no, right?
"
2,5,175,Marshall:,"Of course.
"
2,5,176,Brad:,"I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much. (Brad starts sobbing)
"
2,5,177,Marshall:,"I'll go to Vermont with you.
"
2,5,178,Brad:,"That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat.
"
2,5,179,Ted:,"I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.
"
2,5,180,Marshall:,"Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?
"
2,5,181,Ted:,"Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.
"
2,5,182,Robin:,"And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up.
"
2,5,183,Marshall:,"You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.
"
2,5,184,Ted:,"Good man.
"
2,5,185,Lily:,"Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.
"
2,5,186,Barney:,"Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?
"
2,5,187,Lily (jumping on the bed):,"Oh. Ooooh!
"
2,5,188,Barney:,"All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?
"
2,5,189,Lily:,"Oh, I was just going to watch ""Letterman"" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here. (Barney turns on a another wall-size TV) Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?
"
2,5,190,Barney:,"Please. (He settles himself on the bed)
"
2,5,191,Lily:,"I thought you were going out.
"
2,5,192,Barney:,"Eh. After the monologue.
"
2,5,193,Ted (from 2030):,"The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there...
"
2,5,194,Marshall:,"No. No... No. No! No! (On the phone) Ted. Um, Brad got me flowers.
"
2,5,195,Ted:,"Hold on. (To Robin) Brad got him flowers. (They laugh) I'm sorry. It just got funny again. (Marshall hangs up)
"
2,5,196,Brad:,"Oh, hey...
"
2,5,197,Marshall:,"No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...
"
2,5,198,Girl:,"Hey,sweetie.
"
2,5,199,Brad:,"Hey. (They kiss and Brad give her the flowers)
"
2,5,200,Girl:,"Aww. Hey, Marshall.
"
2,5,201,Marshall:,"Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?
"
2,5,202,Brad:,"Yeah. Happened last night. Uh, I'm sorry, bro. I should have called you.
"
2,5,203,Marshall:,"Yeah, you should have.
"
2,5,204,Brad:,"Well, I didn't mean to hurt...
"
2,5,205,Marshall:,"Don't, Brad. Just don't. (He leaves)
"
2,5,206,Kara:,"Oh, what was with him?
"
2,5,207,Brad:,"I don't know. I think he's in love with me.
"
2,5,208,Barney:,"Aaaaaah!
"
2,5,209,Lily:,"Aaaaaaaaaaah!
"
2,5,210,Barney:,"I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?
"
2,5,211,Lily:,"Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.
"
2,5,212,Barney:,"""Just went to sleep""? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.
"
2,5,213,Lily:,"Hey,it takes two to cuddle.
"
2,5,214,Barney:,"We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!
"
2,5,215,Lily:,"That's what you think a relationship is?
"
2,5,216,Barney:,"You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.
"
2,5,217,Lily:,"Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.
"
2,5,218,Barney:,"Uh-uh. You gotta go.
"
2,5,219,Lily:,"Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.
"
2,5,220,Barney:,"""A certain standard of living""? You didn't pay a single...
"
2,5,221,Ted (from 2030):,"And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment.
"
2,5,222,Ted (from 2030):,"Marshall ran into Brad again some time later.
"
2,5,223,Marshall:,"Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. (Ted laughs)
"
2,5,224,Ted:,"That was great.
"
2,5,225,Marshall:,"Right? Right?
"
2,5,226,Brad:,"Hey, Marshall.
"
2,5,227,Marshall:,"Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?
"
2,5,228,Brad:,"It's good. (To ted) Hey, I'm uh...
"
2,5,229,Ted:,"Yeah, I know who you are.
"
2,5,230,Brad:,"Well,I got to go. I got this thing.
"
2,5,231,Marshall:,"Yeah, me too, but more important.
"
2,5,232,Brad:,"So, I guess I'll see you around.
"
2,5,233,Marshall:,"Sure. Sure. (Brad leaves) Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.
"
2,5,234,Ted:,"Totally looks fat.
"
2,11,1,Ted (V.O.):,"Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.
"
2,11,2,Marshall:,"Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.
"
2,11,3,Ted:,"Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.
"
2,11,4,Marshall:,"No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?
"
2,11,5,Lily:,"Yes.
"
2,11,6,Marshall:,"Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know!
"
2,11,7,Lily:,"Hey, look. Our old answering machine.
"
2,11,8,Ted:,"Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.
"
2,11,9,Lily:,"Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.
"
2,11,10,Ted's father:,"Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this
"
2,11,11,Ted:,"Yes, same Clint.
"
2,11,12,Ted (voix dans le r√©pondeur):,"Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch.
"
2,11,13,Ted (voix off):,"But I didn't say ""Grinch."" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word.
"
2,11,14,Ted:,"Oh, fudge.
"
2,11,15,Ted (voix off):,"But I didn't say fudge.
"
2,11,16,Lily:,"I'm... a what?
"
2,11,17,Ted:,"I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.
"
2,11,18,Lily:,"That was you, Ted.
"
2,11,19,Ted:,"That was Marshall.
"
2,11,20,Lily:,"Marshall left a message for Marshall?
"
2,11,21,Ted:,"You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...
"
2,11,22,Lily:,"Why would you call me that?
"
2,11,23,Ted (voix off):,"It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...
"
2,11,24,Marshall:,"She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.
"
2,11,25,Ted:,"Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.
"
2,11,26,Marshall:,"There's only one of her?
"
2,11,27,Ted:,"Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?
"
2,11,28,Marshall:,"Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.
"
2,11,29,Ted:,"There you go.
"
2,11,30,Ted (voix off):,"And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.
"
2,11,31,Marshall:,"Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.
"
2,11,32,Barney:,"She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.
"
2,11,33,Ted:,"Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?
"
2,11,34,Barney:,"And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret.
"
2,11,35,Marshall:,"Yeah, and if she's such a great ""artist,"" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?
"
2,11,36,Ted:,"Yeah!
"
2,11,37,Marshall:,"Another round!
"
2,11,38,Ted:,"I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.
"
2,11,39,Lily:,"The best friend's job is to call me that word?
"
2,11,40,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
2,11,41,Robin:,"Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.
"
2,11,42,Ted:,"Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.
"
2,11,43,Barney:,"Then why don't you say it now?
"
2,11,44,Ted:,"Grinch. You timed that didn't you?
"
2,11,45,Barney:,"Perfectly.
"
2,11,46,Robin:,"Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?
"
2,11,47,Ted:,"Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth.
"
2,11,48,Ted:,"I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.
"
2,11,49,Lily:,"Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?
"
2,11,50,Ted:,"No!
"
2,11,51,Lily:,"Why not?
"
2,11,52,Ted:,"Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.
"
2,11,53,Lily:,"Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.
"
2,11,54,Barney:,"Ted Vivian Mosby!
"
2,11,55,Ted:,"That's not my middle name.
"
2,11,56,Barney:,"Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
"
2,11,57,Ted:,"Like you've never said that word.
"
2,11,58,Barney:,"I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. (Barney sneezes)
"
2,11,59,Ted:,"Are you sick?
"
2,11,60,Barney:,"Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?
"
2,11,61,Ted:,"No, I meant do you have a cold?
"
2,11,62,Barney:,"I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.
"
2,11,63,Ted:,"I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.
"
2,11,64,Robin:,"Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.
"
2,11,65,Barney:,"I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her)
"
2,11,66,Woman:,"Oh! Oh, God!
"
2,11,67,Barney:,"Uh... ""Bless you"" would have been nice.
"
2,11,68,Robin:,"You're sick.
"
2,11,69,Barney:,"I'm not sick.
"
2,11,70,Robin:,"You're sick.
"
2,11,71,Barney:,"You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?
"
2,11,72,Ted:,"Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.
"
2,11,73,Robin:,"You sure this is gonna work?
"
2,11,74,Ted:,"Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?
"
2,11,75,Robin:,"Totally. Plus free mug.
"
2,11,76,Ted (voix off):,"Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.
"
2,11,77,Ted:,"She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!
"
2,11,78,Ted (voix off):,"That time I did say ""Grinch.""
"
2,11,79,Ted:,"All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.
"
2,11,80,Robin:,"Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?
"
2,11,81,Barney:,"Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive ""no cigars in the apartment rule."" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. (he sneezes on his hand). High five.
"
2,11,82,Robin:,"Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.
"
2,11,83,Barney:,"Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... (Barney falls asleep)
"
2,11,84,Ted:,"Lily!
"
2,11,85,Lily:,"Merry Christmas, assface.
"
2,11,86,Ted:,"Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?
"
2,11,87,Lily:,"At my apartment.
"
2,11,88,Ted:,"You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?
"
2,11,89,Lily:,"Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents.
"
2,11,90,Ted:,"Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.
"
2,11,91,Lily:,"Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.
"
2,11,92,Ted:,"Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...
"
2,11,93,Ted to Robin:,"She hung up.
"
2,11,94,Robin:,"She's just mad. She'll cool down.
"
2,11,95,Ted:,"Lily...
"
2,11,96,Lily:,"Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface!
"
2,11,97,Ted:,"Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.
"
2,11,98,Robin:,"Where are you going?
"
2,11,99,Ted:,"Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx.
"
2,11,100,Barney:,"..dary.
"
2,11,101,Ted:,"Hey, dude, how's the paper going?
"
2,11,102,Marshall:,"Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?
"
2,11,103,Ted:,"Oh... so magical.
"
2,11,104,Marshall:,"When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?
"
2,11,105,Ted:,"Sure does. Look, I gotta go.
"
2,11,106,Marshall:,"Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!
"
2,11,107,Ted:,"Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?
"
2,11,108,Marshall:,"Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?
"
2,11,109,Ted:,"Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means ""More Christ"" to our Spanish friends.
"
2,11,110,Marshall:,"Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait.
"
2,11,111,Ted:,"Right. I gotta go.
"
2,11,112,Marshall:,"Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious?
"
2,11,113,Ted:,"You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call.
"
2,11,114,Marshall:,"Well, tell Lily I love her.
"
2,11,115,Ted:," Right. (he hangs up end takes the other call)- Hello?
"
2,11,116,His mother:,"Ted Evelyn Mosby!
"
2,11,117,Ted:,"Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas.
"
2,11,118,His mother:,"I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word?
"
2,11,119,Ted:,"Oh, God, she called you?
"
2,11,120,His mother:,"Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?
"
2,11,121,Ted:,"No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?
"
2,11,122,Clint:,"Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?
"
2,11,123,Ted:,"Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...
"
2,11,124,Clint:,"Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual...
"
2,11,125,Barney:,"This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous.
"
2,11,126,Robin:,"You just look like a regular guy.
"
2,11,127,Barney:,"Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.
"
2,11,128,Robin:,"And isn't it more comfy?
"
2,11,129,Barney:,"Yes.
"
2,11,130,Robin:,"Come on, you need eat something.
"
2,11,131,Barney:,"Too weak... to hold... bowl.
"
2,11,132,Robin:,"Fine, I'll feed you.
"
2,11,133,Barney:,"Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.
"
2,11,134,Robin:,"No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick.
"
2,11,135,Barney:,"But my throat hurts.
"
2,11,136,Robin:,"No!
"
2,11,137,Barney:,"I hate you!
"
2,11,138,Barney:,"Don't leave me.
"
2,11,139,Lily:,"Who is this?
"
2,11,140,Ted:,"Pizza delivery.
"
2,11,141,Lily:,"Hey, you tricked me.
"
2,11,142,Ted:,"You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?
"
2,11,143,Lily:,"No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.
"
2,11,144,Ted:,"Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?
"
2,11,145,Lily:,"No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.
"
2,11,146,Ted:,"Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.
"
2,11,147,Lily:,"Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.
"
2,11,148,Ted:,"I'm not mad at you.
"
2,11,149,Lily:,"Yes, you are.
"
2,11,150,Ted:,"I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...
"
2,11,151,Lily:,"I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?
"
2,11,152,Ted:,"Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!
"
2,11,153,Lily:,"Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.
"
2,11,154,Ted:,"You were a Grinch!
"
2,11,155,Lily:,"How can you...
"
2,11,156,Ted:,"Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.
"
2,11,157,Lily:,"Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.
"
2,11,158,Ted:,"Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...
"
2,11,159,Voice:,"You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!
"
2,11,160,Lily:,"That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.
"
2,11,161,Ted:,"Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.
"
2,11,162,Robin (on the phone):,"You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.
"
2,11,163,Ted:,"Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.
"
2,11,164,Robin:,"Well, do you want me to go with you?
"
2,11,165,Ted:,"Was that a sincere offer?
"
2,11,166,Robin:,"First tell me your answer.
"
2,11,167,Ted:,"Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?
"
2,11,168,Robin:,"You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.
"
2,11,169,Ted:,"You're gonna be a great mom.
"
2,11,170,Marshall:,"Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.
"
2,11,171,Lily:,"Merry Christmas! What's in the box?
"
2,11,172,Marshall:,"Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.
"
2,11,173,Lily:,"I thought you were writing a paper.
"
2,11,174,Marshall:,"Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...
"
2,11,175,Marshall:,"It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.
"
2,11,176,Women:,"Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.
"
2,11,177,Marshall:,"What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.
"
2,11,178,Women:,"Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it...
"
2,11,179,Marshall:,"Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?
"
2,11,180,Truck driver:,"Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.
"
2,11,181,Truck driver:,"My bad.
"
2,11,182,Marshall:,"I'm okay. (out of the truck) Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.
"
2,11,183,Truck driver:,"No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.
"
2,11,184,Marshall:,"Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?
"
2,11,185,Truck driver:,"Sadly, no.
"
2,11,186,Marshall:,"We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.
"
2,11,187,Lily:,"Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?
"
2,11,188,Marshall:,"It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.
"
2,11,189,Ted:,"Wow, that's a great gift.
"
2,11,190,Marshall:,"Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.
"
2,11,191,Ted:,"Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...
"
2,11,192,Lily:,"When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.
"
2,11,193,Ted:,"Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.
"
2,11,194,Ted:,"Dude... how was the concert?
"
2,11,195,Marshall:,"I couldn't find the outside.
"
2,11,196,Lily:,"I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.
"
2,11,197,Marshall:,"Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?
"
2,11,198,Lily:,"Staten Island.
"
2,11,199,Marshall:,"Why?
"
2,11,200,Ted:,"Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.
"
2,11,201,A kid:,"Like the gift of God's love?
"
2,11,202,Ted:,"No, dude, real presents.
"
2,11,203,Kid:,"Uncle Ted got us presents!
"
2,11,204,Stacy:,"That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.
"
2,11,205,Charity:,"Yay!
"
2,11,206,Stacy:,"Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?
"
2,11,207,Ted:,"Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.
"
2,11,208,Charity:,"Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.
"
2,11,209,Ted:,"That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.
"
2,11,210,Charity:,"Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen.
"
2,11,211,Stacy:,"Who is it, Ted?
"
2,11,212,Ted:,"Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.
"
2,11,213,Lily:,"I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.
"
2,11,214,Ted:,"I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.
"
2,11,215,Lily:,"Are you coming home?
"
2,11,216,Ted:,"Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.
"
2,11,217,Lily:,"Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?
"
2,11,218,Ted:,"Yes
"
2,11,219,Lily:,"Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?
"
2,11,220,Ted:,"Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.
"
2,11,221,Lily:,"That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.
"
2,11,222,Ted:,"Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.
"
2,11,223,Kid:,"Mom, what's a Grinch?
"
2,11,224,Both kids:,"Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...
"
2,11,225,Ted ( to the family):,"Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves (to his friends) Run, run.
"
2,11,226,Marshall:,"Merry Christmas, Marshall.
"
