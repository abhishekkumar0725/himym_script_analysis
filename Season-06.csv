6,20,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, as you know, I was designing Goliath National Bank's new headquarters on the site of this old hotel, The Arcadian. Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey.
"
6,20,2,Crowd:,"G-N-B is the e-ne-my!
"
6,20,3,Zoey:,"(She sees Ted at the window) Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on! Hey, sweetie! Are we still on for dinner at 8:00 at Valenzisi's? That's great! I can't wait!
"
6,20,4,Crowd:,"That's great. I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait!
"
6,20,5,Ted from 2030:,"But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.
"
6,20,6,Barney:,"Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.
"
6,20,7,Robin:,"Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it.
"
6,20,8,Lily:,"Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?
"
6,20,9,Ted:,"Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.
"
6,20,10,Lily:,"You guys are in screaming matches all the time.
"
6,20,11,Ted:,"Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.
"
6,20,12,Ted from 2030:,"It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other.
"
6,20,13,Ted:,"The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!
"
6,20,14,Zoey:,"re you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant!
"
6,20,15,Ted:,"Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.
"
6,20,16,Ted:,"No, you hang up.
"
6,20,17,Zoey:,"No, you hang up.
"
6,20,18,Ted:,"No, you hang up.
"
6,20,19,Zoey:,"No, you hang up.
"
6,20,20,Ted:,"No, you hang up! (Later) No, you hang up.
"
6,20,21,Zoey:,"No, you hang up.
"
6,20,22,Ted:,"No, you... (His phone starts beeping) Hold on. (beep) Hello?
"
6,20,23,Robin:,"For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?
"
6,20,24,Ted:,"Why would you do that?!
"
6,20,25,Zoey:,"-I thought you'd like it.
"
6,20,26,Ted:,"Who likes that?
"
6,20,27,Zoey:," like it.
"
6,20,28,Lily:,"Your relationship sounds exhausting.
"
6,20,29,Ted:,"Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.
"
6,20,30,Lily:,"Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.
"
6,20,31,Ted from 2030:,"Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything.
"
6,20,32,Marshall:,"I have to quit.
"
6,20,33,Barney:,"Quit GNB?! Why?
"
6,20,34,Marshall:,"I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...
"
6,20,35,Barney:,"Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.
"
6,20,36,Lily:,"Baby, you have my full support.
"
6,20,37,Barney:,"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.
"
6,20,38,Robin:," don't think you know what Spain is.
"
6,20,39,Barney:,"Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.
"
6,20,40,Ted:,"It's dinero.
"
6,20,41,Barney:,"Where? I want his autograph!
"
6,20,42,Ted from 2030:,"So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.
"
6,20,43,Robin:,"It's graduation goggles.
"
6,20,44,Marshall:,"What?
"
6,20,45,Robin:,"raduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.
"
6,20,46,Lily:,"The guy who was basically a dog?
"
6,20,47,Robin:,"e was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog): He was a good boy.
"
6,20,48,Barney:,"Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.
"
6,20,49,Robin:,"he point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.
"
6,20,50,Marshall:,"You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.
"
6,20,51,Barney:,"No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!
"
6,20,52,Lily:,"Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. (Lily and Marshall kisses)
"
6,20,53,Ted:,"You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.
"
6,20,54,Lily:,"I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.
"
6,20,55,Barney:,"It starts with an... ""L?""
"
6,20,56,Girl:,"How can you not remember my name?
"
6,20,57,Ted:,"It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.
"
6,20,58,Zoey:,"Well, they don't do that all the time.
"
6,20,59,Ted:,"es, they do.
"
6,20,60,Zoey:,"No, they don't.
"
6,20,61,Ted:,"es, they do. It's like they...
"
6,20,62,Lily and Marshall:,".. don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally.
"
6,20,63,Girl:,"It rhymes with your name.
"
6,20,64,Barney:,"And I said my name was...?
"
6,20,65,Marshall:,"Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.
"
6,20,66,Lily:,"Oh, good for you, sweetie.
"
6,20,67,Marshall:,"Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?
"
6,20,68,Lily:,"Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?
"
6,20,69,Ted:,"Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?""
"
6,20,70,Barney:,"It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.
"
6,20,71,Ted:,"Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.
"
6,20,72,Man:,"Guys, everything's ruined.
"
6,20,73,Ted:,"What? Why?
"
6,20,74,Man:,"Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.
"
6,20,75,Robin:,"..so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.
"
6,20,76,Ted:,"I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.
"
6,20,77,Lily:,"Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?
"
6,20,78,Ted:,"Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?
"
6,20,79,Lily:,"It's not.
"
6,20,80,Ted:,"Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?""
"
6,20,81,Lily:,"Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, ""Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?""
"
6,20,82,Ted:,"We take turns! Sometimes.
"
6,20,83,Marshall:,"Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.
"
6,20,84,Barney:,"I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.
"
6,20,85,Robin:,"Hershel?
"
6,20,86,Barney:,"What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.
"
6,20,87,Lily:,"Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.
"
6,20,88,Barney:,"There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?
"
6,20,89,Marshall:,"Barney, I'm not playing...
"
6,20,90,Barney:,"Just come back to GNB already!
"
6,20,91,Marshall:,"I'm really loving my new job.
"
6,20,92,Lily:,"Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.
"
6,20,93,Marshall:,"I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?
"
6,20,94,Lily:,"Baby, you have my full support.
"
6,20,95,Marshall:,"Thanks, baby. (phone chirps) Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.
"
6,20,96,Barney:,"That's how I'm gonna use mine.
"
6,20,97,Robin:,"Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?
"
6,20,98,Barney:,"Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.
"
6,20,99,Robin:,"kay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?
"
6,20,100,Barney:,"Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. ""Barney, we have to talk about your father."" ""Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil."" ""Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session ""between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute."" I don't need this!
"
6,20,101,Ted:,"Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...
"
6,20,102,Lily:,"Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? (Ted says something in spanish) Perfect. Let's go.
"
6,20,103,Barney:,"Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?
"
6,20,104,Marshall:,"Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.
"
6,20,105,Barney:,"Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.
"
6,20,106,Robin:,"(Robin is standing at the door) Oh, my God!
"
6,20,107,Barney:,"How long have you been there?
"
6,20,108,Robin:,"You don't remember?
"
6,20,109,Robin:,"Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.
"
6,20,110,Barney:,"Oh, no, I'm fine.
"
6,20,111,Robin:,"Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?
"
6,20,112,Barney:,"ure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?
"
6,20,113,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
6,20,114,Barney:,"ight. So, um... Chinese?
"
6,20,115,Ted:,"You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.
"
6,20,116,Lily:,"You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.
"
6,20,117,Ted:,"Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.
"
6,20,118,Lily:,"But I thought you liked being challenged.
"
6,20,119,Ted:,"Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!
"
6,20,120,Lily:,"Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?
"
6,20,121,Ted:,"You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)
"
6,20,122,Man:,"I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.
"
6,20,123,Ted:,"Um, he speaks perfect English.
"
6,20,124,Lily:,"Yeah, I-I know.
"
6,20,125,Ted:,"Then why did you ask me to come?
"
6,20,126,Lily:,"So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.
"
6,20,127,Ted:,"W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?
"
6,20,128,Lily:,"You were right. If I hear myself say ""Baby, you have my full support"" one more time, I swear I'm gonna murder someone!
"
6,20,129,Ted:,"What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?
"
6,20,130,Lily:,"I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bomb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!
"
6,20,131,Ted:,"Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.
"
6,20,132,Lily:,"Marshall's been asking a lot lately.
"
6,20,133,Ted:,"But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.
"
6,20,134,Lily:,"I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.
"
6,20,135,Ted:,"Lil...
"
6,20,136,Lily:,"Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. (Lily leaves)
"
6,20,137,Man:,"My bag? Oh, no. I got it.
"
6,20,138,Barney:,"There's nothing to talk about.
"
6,20,139,Robin:,"You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.
"
6,20,140,Barney:,"I don't want to talk about it, okay?
"
6,20,141,Robin:,"Why not?
"
6,20,142,Barney:,"Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.
"
6,20,143,Robin:,"I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking.
"
6,20,144,Barney:,"That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?
"
6,20,145,Robin:,"No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.
"
6,20,146,Barney:,"Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.
"
6,20,147,Robin:,"Huh?
"
6,20,148,Barney:,"It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.
"
6,20,149,Barney:,"Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.
"
6,20,150,Marshall:,"Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.
"
6,20,151,Barney:,"I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...
"
6,20,152,Barney:,"..he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?
"
6,20,153,Robin:,"What is wrong with you?
"
6,20,154,Marshall:,"Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.
"
6,20,155,Prof. Rodriguez:,"Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations?
"
6,20,156,Marshall:,"Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.
"
6,20,157,Ted:,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...
"
6,20,158,Marshall:,"What?
"
6,20,159,Ted:,"Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(sighs) Lily...
"
6,20,160,Lily:,"Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.
"
6,20,161,Marshall:,"Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?
"
6,20,162,Lily:,"Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.
"
6,20,163,Marshall:,"No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?
"
6,20,164,Lily:,"Baby, you have my full support.
"
6,20,165,Zoey:,"Ted.
"
6,20,166,Ted:,"Hey! What are you doing here?
"
6,20,167,Zoey:,"This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.
"
6,20,168,Ted:,"This you can be supportive of?!
"
6,20,169,Zoey:,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
6,20,170,Ted:,"I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend!
"
6,20,171,Zoey:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?
"
6,20,172,Ted from 2030:,"And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.
"
6,20,173,Lily:,"You're too young. This isn't fair.
"
6,20,174,Marshall:,"We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.
"
6,20,175,"Barney, weakly:","Thank you, Marshall. (coughs weakly) Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?
"
6,20,176,Marshall:,"Yes, of course, of course... anything.
"
6,20,177,Barney:,"Eat this meatball sub.
"
6,20,178,Marshall:,"Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...
"
6,20,179,Barney:,"I don't have much time!
"
6,20,180,Marshall:,"Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?
"
6,20,181,"Barney, with a mean laugh:","I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!
"
6,20,182,Ted:,"Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.
"
6,8,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, one morning in 2010, I opened the newspaper only to discover an op-ed written by Zoey Pierson. You remember Zoey.
"
6,8,2,Zoey:,"Key Ted Mosby's car.
"
6,8,3,Ted from 2030:,"In those four column inches, she railed against me and my company, GNB, for wanting to tear down a beautiful old building: The Arcadian. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the piece ran on a Saturday, which as you both know, is Dad's crossword day.
"
6,8,4,Ted:,"She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a ""fat cat."" Me and my ""fat-cat friends."" We're not fat cats.
"
6,8,5,Barney:,"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?
"
6,8,6,Marshall:,"Impeccable, old bean. To industry!
"
6,8,7,Barney:,"Ah, bully!
"
6,8,8,Ted from 2030:,"Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us.
"
6,8,9,Marshall:,"Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?
"
6,8,10,Ted:,"They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.
"
6,8,11,Marshall:,"Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?
"
6,8,12,Marshall:,"Nice monkey suit, Russell.
"
6,8,13,Russel:,"Come on, guys.
"
6,8,14,Marshall:,"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.
"
6,8,15,Ted:,"Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.
"
6,8,16,Robin:,"I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.
"
6,8,17,Lily:,"Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?
"
6,8,18,Marshall:,"Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.
"
6,8,19,Lily:,"Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.
"
6,8,20,Ted:,"Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.
"
6,8,21,Lily:,"Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.
"
6,8,22,Everyone:,"Ooh.
"
6,8,23,Barney:,"Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.
"
6,8,24,Marshall:,"Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?
"
6,8,25,Barney:,"I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, ""Don't touch anything"". To a kid. That's like someone telling us ""Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.""
"
6,8,26,Everyone:,"Ooh.
"
6,8,27,Robin:,"Not bad.
"
6,8,28,Barney:,"So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.
"
6,8,29,Robin:,"Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.
"
6,8,30,Barney:,"It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?
"
6,8,31,Arthur:,"Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot.
"
6,8,32,George:,"But you can, and should, call me The Captain.
"
6,8,33,Marshall:,"The Captain?
"
6,8,34,Barney:,"The Captain?
"
6,8,35,Arthur:,"Back in school we met during a production of Guys and Dolls. The Captain was Nathan Detroit to my assistant stage manager. Marshall and Barney here, are the future of Goliath National Bank.
"
6,8,36,George:,"Well, ahoy.
"
6,8,37,Barney:,"Ahoy.
"
6,8,38,Marshall:,"Ahoy, The Captain.
"
6,8,39,Arthur:,"The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig.
"
6,8,40,George:,"Please, enjoy yourselves, have fun, but don't touch anything.
"
6,8,41,Marshall:,"Thank you, The Captain.
"
6,8,42,Barney:,"Challenge accepted.
"
6,8,43,Lily:,"Wow. ""The future of Goliath National Bank""?
"
6,8,44,Marshall:,"I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.
"
6,8,45,Lily:,"Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.
"
6,8,46,Lily:,"So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...
"
6,8,47,Marshall:,"I think I'm going to say yes.
"
6,8,48,Barney:,"Ah, that's the stuff.
"
6,8,49,Robin:,"I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.
"
6,8,50,Barney:,"Impressive. Try this on for size.
"
6,8,51,Robin:,"You want to dance? Let's dance.
"
6,8,52,Barney:,"I live for the dance.
"
6,8,53,Robin:,"Get... your other hand... off my ass.
"
6,8,54,Barney:,"Sorry, sorry.
"
6,8,55,Lily:,"What do you mean, you're going to say yes?
"
6,8,56,Marshall:,"I-I want to keep working at GNB.
"
6,8,57,Lily:,"But I thought that you...
"
6,8,58,Ted:,"Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact: If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. (whispers): Diarrhea. Right? Right?
"
6,8,59,Lily:,"But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.
"
6,8,60,Marshall:,"Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.
"
6,8,61,"Ted, whispering:","Poo-poo. Poo-poo platter.
"
6,8,62,Ted:,"Zoey? Well, well, well.
"
6,8,63,Zoey:,"You have got to be kidding me.
"
6,8,64,Ted:,"So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?
"
6,8,65,Zoey:,"And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first?
"
6,8,66,George:,"Darling, there you are.
"
6,8,67,Zoey:,"Ted, this is my husband.
"
6,8,68,Ted:,"Yeah, old stuff's great.
"
6,8,69,Robin:,"Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?
"
6,8,70,Barney:,"This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.
"
6,8,71,Robin:,"You're right.
"
6,8,72,Barney:,"Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?
"
6,8,73,Robin:,"Yeah, I do.
"
6,8,74,Ted:,"So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?
"
6,8,75,George:,"Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name.
"
6,8,76,Ted:,"Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.
"
6,8,77,Zoey:,"This is Ted.
"
6,8,78,George:,"Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat.
"
6,8,79,Ted:,"The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.
"
6,8,80,George:,"Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.
"
6,8,81,Ted:,"She!
"
6,8,82,George:,"Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me?
"
6,8,83,Ted:,"Yes. The sea is all like, ""Ted, come hang out.""
"
6,8,84,George:,"I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off.
"
6,8,85,Ted:,"Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.
"
6,8,86,Zoey:,"Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal.
"
6,8,87,Ted:,"No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.
"
6,8,88,Zoey:,"You're going down.
"
6,8,89,Ted:,"Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?
"
6,8,90,Lily:,"So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?
"
6,8,91,"Ted, whispering:","Wieners.
"
6,8,92,Marshall:,"That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.
"
6,8,93,Ted:,"Wieners and gonads.
"
6,8,94,Lily:,"What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?
"
6,8,95,Marshall:,"Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...
"
6,8,96,Ted:,"Boogers.
"
6,8,97,Marshall:,"We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell ""women"" with a ""Y"" anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.
"
6,8,98,Lily:,"So how long have you felt this way?
"
6,8,99,Marshall:,"Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.
"
6,8,100,Ted:,"Hershey squirts.
"
6,8,101,Robin:,"Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.
"
6,8,102,Ted:,"Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?
"
6,8,103,Zoey:,"Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk.
"
6,8,104,Ted:,"Good luck killing James Bond. (Zoey takes Ted away) Are we allowed in here?
"
6,8,105,Zoey:,"What do you want from me?
"
6,8,106,Ted:,"I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.
"
6,8,107,Zoey:,"My life isn't perfect.
"
6,8,108,Ted:,"Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.
"
6,8,109,Ted from 2030:,"It did.
"
6,8,110,Lily:,"You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.
"
6,8,111,Marshall:,"Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.
"
6,8,112,Lily:,"What?
"
6,8,113,Lily:,"So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?
"
6,8,114,Marshall:,"Affirmatootly.
"
6,8,115,Lily:,"And become an environmental lawyer?
"
6,8,116,Marshall:,"Yepskerdoodles.
"
6,8,117,Lily:,"Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf?
"
6,8,118,Marshall:,"Posititochadochmecochepopocha.
"
6,8,119,Marshall:,"Lawyered.
"
6,8,120,Lily:,"Okay, that's also a made-up word.
"
6,8,121,Marshall:,"Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.
"
6,8,122,Barney:,"Niled it.
"
6,8,123,Museum guard:,"Excuse me.
"
6,8,124,Barney:,"Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.
"
6,8,125,Zoey:,"I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.
"
6,8,126,Ted:,"He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.
"
6,8,127,Zoey:,"I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building.
"
6,8,128,Ted:,"It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.
"
6,8,129,Zoey:,"Ted, that was... really easy.
"
6,8,130,Ted:,"What?
"
6,8,131,Ted's voice (on a recording):,"They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.
"
6,8,132,Zoey:,"This should be useful.
"
6,8,133,Ted from 2030:,"And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes.
"
6,8,134,Ted:,"You tricked me.
"
6,8,135,Zoey:,"Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime.
"
6,8,136,Guard:,"Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it...
"
6,8,137,Robin:,"I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?
"
6,8,138,Guard:,"Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old.
"
6,8,139,Barney:,"Oh, yeah, that story is legend... (phone ringing) Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?
"
6,8,140,Guard:,"No. But I could, uh, check the files.
"
6,8,141,Barney:,"Thank you.
"
6,8,142,George:,"Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part from Guys and Dolls.
"
6,8,143,Arthur:,"Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche.
"
6,8,144,George:,"So I hear my wife got you pretty good.
"
6,8,145,Ted:,"She caught me on tape trashing GNB.
"
6,8,146,George:,"Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. ""But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend."" ""I said no such thing."" ""Oh, yeah?"" Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings.
"
6,8,147,Ted:,"Really? You'd do that to your own wife?
"
6,8,148,George:,"Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of troubles, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem.
"
6,8,149,Ted:,"No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.
"
6,8,150,George:,"Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking.
"
6,8,151,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, there's an amazing architectural phenomenon in the Natural History Museum. If you stand in the right spot, you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room.
"
6,8,152,Guard:,"July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson.
"
6,8,153,Barney:,"Who's the master, Leroy?
"
6,8,154,Guard:,"Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker.
"
6,8,155,Barney:,"Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.
"
6,8,156,Guard:,"Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.
"
6,8,157,Barney:,"Jerry's my uncle.
"
6,8,158,College Marshall:,"Lily? Honey, what's wrong? You okay? Do you want a hit of this sandwich?
"
6,8,159,Lily:,"I want you.
"
6,8,160,College Marshall:,"Awesome. Let me just put a sock on the doorknob.
"
6,8,161,Lily:,"o. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.
"
6,8,162,College Marshall:,"What? How have I changed? Did I cheat on you?
"
6,8,163,Lily:,"No.
"
6,8,164,College Marshall:,"Did I stop writing poems for you?
"
6,8,165,Lily:,"Yes, but I'm okay with that.
"
6,8,166,College Marshall:,"Am I not as good at making the sweet, sweet love to you?
"
6,8,167,Lily:,"Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.
"
6,8,168,College Marshall:,"You said that any longer would be too much.
"
6,8,169,Lily:,"It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.
"
6,8,170,College Marshall:,"Well, you can't have me. Look at the sign. I'm extinct. I've gone the way of Jane's Addiction.
"
6,8,171,Lily:,"Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.
"
6,8,172,College Marshall:,"They did?
"
6,8,173,Lily:,"Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.
"
6,8,174,College Marshall:,"Are you serious?! That is awesome! Are they just as good?
"
6,8,175,Lily:,"Sure.
"
6,8,176,College Marshall:,"Look, I know that Corporate Marshall wears a tie and everything, but it sounds like he hasn't changed where it counts.
"
6,8,177,Marshall:,"Hey.
"
6,8,178,Lily:,"Hi.
"
6,8,179,Marshall:,"Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?
"
6,8,180,Lily:,"We'll make it work.
"
6,8,181,College Marshall:,"There he goes. The Marathon Man. Mr. Stamina himself. I can kiss better than that old man.
"
6,8,182,Robin:,"So when was the last time you saw him?
"
6,8,183,Barney:,"It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.
"
6,8,184,Robin:,"Moms.
"
6,8,185,Barney:,"He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.
"
6,8,186,Robin:,"Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...
"
6,8,187,Barney:,"But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.
"
6,8,188,Robin:,"Barney, do you want...?
"
6,8,189,Barney:,"I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
"
6,8,190,Ted:,"I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?
"
6,8,191,Zoey:,"Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing?
"
6,8,192,Ted:,"Oh, I thought we were...
"
6,8,193,Zoey:,"Fine. I erased the tape.
"
6,8,194,Ted:,"What?
"
6,8,195,Zoey:,"I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square.
"
6,8,196,Ted:,"Thanks.
"
6,8,197,Zoey:,"But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman.
"
6,8,198,Ted:,"You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.
"
6,8,199,Zoey:,"Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs.
"
6,8,200,Ted:,"Bring it on, Princess.
"
6,8,201,Arthur:,"Eriksen... It's, uh, 3:00 a.m. You know what, you might as well not even go home.
"
6,8,202,Ted from 2030:,"And so Marshall stayed right on at Goliath National Bank. Of course, it wouldn't last forever. But that's another story.
"
6,9,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, it seemed like Aunt Lily could only talk about one thing: babies.
"
6,9,2,Robin:,"Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day.
"
6,9,3,Lily:,"Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.
"
6,9,4,Robin:,"Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.
"
6,9,5,Lily:,"Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.
"
6,9,6,Robin:,"They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.
"
6,9,7,Lily:,"Look at this crib.
"
6,9,8,Ted from 2030:,"But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere.
"
6,9,9,Marshall:,"Oh, you're wearing a flower.
"
6,9,10,Barney:,"Thank you.
"
6,9,11,Marshall:,"Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.
"
6,9,12,Barney:,"I know. Isn't it?
"
6,9,13,Robin:,"Why are you wearing that?
"
6,9,14,Ted:,"Why does Barney do anything ever?
"
6,9,15,Barney:,"Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The ""everyday boutonniere"" by Stinson.
"
6,9,16,Robin:,"And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.
"
6,9,17,Marshall:,"Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.
"
6,9,18,Barney:,"Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for ""bootie is near?"" True story. Une histoire vraie.
"
6,9,19,Robin:,"Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for ""sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid""""
"
6,9,20,Barney:,"Woman, you best check yourself.
"
6,9,21,Robin:,"Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...
"
6,9,22,Barney:,"Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!
"
6,9,23,Robin:,"What, are we gonna duel?
"
6,9,24,Barney:,"No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!
"
6,9,25,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now.
"
6,9,26,Barney:,"I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!
"
6,9,27,Marshall:,"Oh, you haven't watched it yet?
"
6,9,28,Barney:,"No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.
"
6,9,29,Marshall:,"Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.
"
6,9,30,Lily:,"Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?
"
6,9,31,Robin:,"Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.
"
6,9,32,Lily:,"Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.
"
6,9,33,Barney:,"Space Teens?! Is this a porno?
"
6,9,34,Robin:,"No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.
"
6,9,35,Ted:,"I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p0rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.
"
6,9,36,Barney:,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?
"
6,9,37,Robin:,"Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.
"
6,9,38,Barney:,"Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.
"
6,9,39,Robin:,"Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?
"
6,9,40,Lily:,"Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?
"
6,9,41,Robin:,"Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.
"
6,9,42,Marshall:,"That sounds ridiculous.
"
6,9,43,Robin Sparkles:,"So sue me. Like the producers of Milky Way Mathletes tried to.
"
6,9,44,Jessica Glitter:,"Great job using long division to catch that space burglar, eh?
"
6,9,45,Robin Sparkles:,"Well, what can I say? He'll be in galactic jail for the remainder of his life.
"
6,9,46,Robot:,"Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh.
"
6,9,47,Robin Sparkles:,"Brace for turbulence!
"
6,9,48,Lily:,"Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.
"
6,9,49,Robin:,"Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...
"
6,9,50,Marshall:,"You can't do that on television.
"
6,9,51,Robin:,"Exactly.
"
6,9,52,Marshall:,"No. You can't do that on television!
"
6,9,53,Ted:,"Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.
"
6,9,54,Robin:,"It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.
"
6,9,55,Marshall:,"I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.
"
6,9,56,Robin:,"You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?
"
6,9,57,Man:,"Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?
"
6,9,58,Robin Sparkles:,"Oh. 30.
"
6,9,59,Man:,"Yes! Oh! Seven times four?
"
6,9,60,Jessica Glitter:,"28!
"
6,9,61,Man:,"Keep going! Eight times nine?
"
6,9,62,Jessica Glitter:,"72!
"
6,9,63,Man:,"Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?
"
6,9,64,Barney:,"I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?
"
6,9,65,Lily:,"Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?
"
6,9,66,Robin:,"Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.
"
6,9,67,Lily:,"But BFFs are forever.
"
6,9,68,Marshall:,"Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.
"
6,9,69,Ted:,"I'm still friends with Punchy.
"
6,9,70,Marshall:,"Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.
"
6,9,71,Ted:,"Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.
"
6,9,72,Punchy:,"Schmosby!
"
6,9,73,Ted:,"Punchy!
"
6,9,74,Punchy:,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.
"
6,9,75,Ted:,"Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.
"
6,9,76,Punchy:,"Definitely.
"
6,9,77,Ted:,"We are just two peas.
"
6,9,78,Lily:,"I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.
"
6,9,79,Robin:,"Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.
"
6,9,80,Lily:,"Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?
"
6,9,81,Ted:,"Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?
"
6,9,82,Lily:,"Four years, three months.
"
6,9,83,Ted:,"Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.
"
6,9,84,Marshall:,"Of course. Robin hates kids.
"
6,9,85,Barney:,"The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.
"
6,9,86,Ted:,"Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, ""To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.
"
6,9,87,Marshall:,"That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?
"
6,9,88,Lily:,"Robin's gonna dump me!
"
6,9,89,Marshall:,"Oh, sweetheart.
"
6,9,90,Ted:,"When a second uterus plumped becomes...
"
6,9,91,Marshall:,"Dude. Feel the room.
"
6,9,92,Robin:,"No.
"
6,9,93,Ted:,"We've been waiting all day!
"
6,9,94,Robin:,"Just watch it without me.
"
6,9,95,Barney:,"Two dudes on the couch together watching p0rn? That's kind of weird.
"
6,9,96,Robin:,"Okay, it's not p0rn, it's a kids' show.
"
6,9,97,Ted:,"Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.
"
6,9,98,Robin:,"Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.
"
6,9,99,Barney:,"We...
"
6,9,100,Robin:,"I'm serious.
"
6,9,101,Robin Sparkles:,"Hey Jessica, how's your beaver?
"
6,9,102,Jessica Glitter:,"Great. How's your beaver?
"
6,9,103,Robin Sparkles:,"Busy as ever!
"
6,9,104,Robin:,"Our characters had pet beavers.
"
6,9,105,Ted:,"Sure.
"
6,9,106,Robin:,"The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.
"
6,9,107,Barney:,"It's a noble creature.
"
6,9,108,Man:,"Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?
"
6,9,109,Robin:,"Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!
"
6,9,110,Barney:,"No arguments here.
"
6,9,111,Punchy:,"'Sup Shmosby!
"
6,9,112,Ted:,"Punchy, what are you doing here?
"
6,9,113,Punchy:,"Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?
"
6,9,114,Ted:,"Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?
"
6,9,115,Punchy:,"n your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch.
"
6,9,116,Robin:,"Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?
"
6,9,117,Punchy:,"I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?
"
6,9,118,Punchy:,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!
"
6,9,119,Robin:,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!
"
6,9,120,Ted:,"Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.
"
6,9,121,Robin:,"Don't care.
"
6,9,122,Ted:,"He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.
"
6,9,123,Robin:,"Get a hotel.
"
6,9,124,Ted:,"Robin... LeBron.
"
6,9,125,Robin:,"Okay, one night. Got to go.
"
6,9,126,Lily:,"Where are you going? We just got here.
"
6,9,127,Robin:,"Oh, a Korean massage.
"
6,9,128,Lily:,"By yourself?
"
6,9,129,Robin:,"Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.
"
6,9,130,Lily:,"Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.
"
6,9,131,Marshall:,"Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.
"
6,9,132,Ted:,"Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?
"
6,9,133,Marshall:,"Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.
"
6,9,134,Lily:,"I don't.
"
6,9,135,Marshall:,"Lily, how old am I?
"
6,9,136,Lily:,"384 months.
"
6,9,137,Punchy:,"Busted!
"
6,9,138,Marshall:,"Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.
"
6,9,139,Ted from 2030:,"So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies.
"
6,9,140,Robin:,"Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?
"
6,9,141,Lily:,"Crib...
"
6,9,142,Robin:,"What's the matter? You look rattled.
"
6,9,143,Lily:,"Rattled? I want to talk about babies.
"
6,9,144,Robin:,"What?
"
6,9,145,Lily:,"Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...
"
6,9,146,Robin:,"Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.
"
6,9,147,Lily:,"What's that supposed to mean?
"
6,9,148,Robin:,"It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!
"
6,9,149,Lily:,"Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.
"
6,9,150,Robin:,"Great.
"
6,9,151,Lily:,"Great.
"
6,9,152,Marshall:,"For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?
"
6,9,153,Lily:,"I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.
"
6,9,154,Marshall:,"Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you ""accidentally"" shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.
"
6,9,155,Lily:,"No!
"
6,9,156,Marshall:,"Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.
"
6,9,157,Lily:,"I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?
"
6,9,158,Marshall:,"You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.
"
6,9,159,Lily:,"Okay.
"
6,9,160,Marshall:,"Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.
"
6,9,161,Punchy:,"Times Square's the bomb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.
"
6,9,162,Ted:,"Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...
"
6,9,163,Punchy:,"They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?
"
6,9,164,Ted:,"No.
"
6,9,165,Punchy:,"Times Square's the bomb!
"
6,9,166,Ted:,"Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?
"
6,9,167,Punchy:,"I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.
"
6,9,168,Barney:,"Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, ""You are the weakest link. Goodbye."" Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.
"
6,9,169,Ted:,"Okay, yeah. I know.
"
6,9,170,Barney:,"You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.
"
6,9,171,Punchy:,"Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.
"
6,9,172,Ted:,"That's your scrotum.
"
6,9,173,Punchy:,"You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that.
"
6,9,174,Ted:,"Yeah, he's gotta go.
"
6,9,175,Lily:,"What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?
"
6,9,176,Marshall:,"Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!
"
6,9,177,Lily:,"How did you find Glitter?
"
6,9,178,Marshall:,"Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...
"
6,9,179,Jessica Glitter:,"His friend Barney looked me up, hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.
"
6,9,180,Marshall:,"Yo, Glitter... Be cool.
"
6,9,181,Jessica Glitter:,"So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now?
"
6,9,182,Lily:,"More like ex-best friends. Just like you.
"
6,9,183,Jessica Glitter:,"I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin.
"
6,9,184,Lily:,"Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...
"
6,9,185,Jessica Glitter:,"Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her.
"
6,9,186,Lily:,"What? Why?
"
6,9,187,Jessica Glitter:,"Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to kill herself.
"
6,9,188,Marshall:,"Charge!
"
6,9,189,Lily:,"Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.
"
6,9,190,Jessica Glitter:,"Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby?
"
6,9,191,Lily:,"Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.
"
6,9,192,Jessica Glitter:,"Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually...(Marshall is playing the piano) Hey. Go ahead.
"
6,9,193,Punchy:,"Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here?
"
6,9,194,Ted:,"Punchy, it's time to go back.
"
6,9,195,Punchy:,"Back to Times Square?!
"
6,9,196,Ted:,"Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.
"
6,9,197,Punchy:,"I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.
"
6,9,198,Ted:,"You worry about me?
"
6,9,199,Punchy:,"Yeah. The other day, when you called...
"
6,9,200,Punchy:,"Schmosby!
"
6,9,201,Ted:,"Punchy!
"
6,9,202,Punchy:,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.
"
6,9,203,Ted:,"Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...
"
6,9,204,Punchy:,"Definitely.
"
6,9,205,Woman:,"Sweetie, who was that?
"
6,9,206,Punchy:,"It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed.
"
6,9,207,Woman:,"Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?
"
6,9,208,Punchy:,"Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.
"
6,9,209,Woman:,"Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.
"
6,9,210,Punchy:,"You think that would work?
"
6,9,211,Woman:,"Worked on me.
"
6,9,212,Ted:,"Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.
"
6,9,213,Punchy:,"She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married.
"
6,9,214,Ted:,"Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.
"
6,9,215,Punchy:,"Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.
"
6,9,216,Ted:,"Of course I will.
"
6,9,217,Punchy:,"Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Oh, that's it...
"
6,9,218,Ted from 2030:,"That night, Lily went to the one place she knew she could find Robin-- New York's premiere Canadian bar, the Hoser Hut.
"
6,9,219,Lily:,"Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.
"
6,9,220,Robin:,"No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...
"
6,9,221,Lily:,"I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.
"
6,9,222,Robin:,"Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.
"
6,9,223,Marshall:,"I'm so happy you guys made up.
"
6,9,224,Ted:,"Me, too.
"
6,9,225,Barney:,"Where do I know this song from?
"
6,9,226,Robin:,"Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?
"
6,9,227,"Jessica, singing:","* Hey, beaver, come on; When you feel alone; Just pick up that phone; And I'll be there to share my... *
"
6,9,228,Robin and Jessica:,"* Ice cream cone; We'll lick it side by side *
"
6,9,229,Barney:,"Wow. This is so dirty.
"
6,9,230,Marshall:,"Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.
"
6,9,231,Ted:,"Yeah, dude, come on.
"
6,9,232,Robin and Jessica:,"* Day is done; Two beavers are better than one; Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah; Two beavers are better than one; They're twice the fun; Ask anyone; A second beaver can be second to none; Two beavers are better than one. *
"
6,9,233,Robin:,"*Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...*
"
6,9,234,Jessica:,"*You're my favorite beaver...*
"
6,9,235,Robin and Jessica:,"*Two beavers are better than one. Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah; Two beavers are better than one; They're twice the fun; Ask anyone; A second beaver ; Can be second to none.*
"
6,9,236,Robot:,"Two beavers are better than one. *
"
6,21,1,Jerry:,"Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz kill of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.
"
6,21,2,Barney:,"What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?
"
6,21,3,Jerry:,"But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.
"
6,21,4,Barney:,"But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.
"
6,21,5,Jerry:,"Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?
"
6,21,6,Barney:,"A drunk audience.
"
6,21,7,"Jerry, laughing:","Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now... I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear... so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey... Never... stop... partying.
"
6,21,8,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly...
"
6,21,9,Jerry:,"I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.
"
6,21,10,Ted from 2030:,"This time it was Barney who did the walking.
"
6,21,11,Barney:,"Bye.
"
6,21,12,Ted from 2030:,"And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...
"
6,21,13,Barney:,"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.
"
6,21,14,Marshall:,"Mmm. Your dad?
"
6,21,15,Barney:,"My dad!
"
6,21,16,Barney:,"Barney Stinson.
"
6,21,17,Jerry:,"Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?
"
6,21,18,Barney:,"Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.
"
6,21,19,Jerry:,"Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... ""Crazy Jerry""? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?
"
6,21,20,Barney:,"You do not know how right you are.
"
6,21,21,Barney:,"Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.
"
6,21,22,Ted:,"You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.
"
6,21,23,Barney:,"I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.
"
6,21,24,Robin:,"Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.
"
6,21,25,Barney:,"ell, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?
"
6,21,26,Barney:,"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.
"
6,21,27,Lily:,"That's why you brought these guys.
"
6,21,28,Barney:,"o. That's why I brought these guys. (He gets several cards out of his inside pocket) I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.
"
6,21,29,Marshall:,"Improvements?!
"
6,21,30,Barney:,"eah.
"
6,21,31,Marshall:,"Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.
"
6,21,32,Barney:,"obin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.
"
6,21,33,Lily:,"Whoo-hoo!
"
6,21,34,Marshall:,"Gross!
"
6,21,35,Barney:,"lso, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. (chuckles) Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.
"
6,21,36,Ted:,"Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""
"
6,21,37,Barney:,"ed, card.
"
6,21,38,Ted:,"Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde.""
"
6,21,39,Barney:,"inally... Robin, you're dating Ted.
"
6,21,40,Robin:,"Aw, man! Why?
"
6,21,41,Barney:,"I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh... (chuckles) no, thanks.
"
6,21,42,Lily:,"Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?
"
6,21,43,Ted:,"How good was that movie?
"
6,21,44,Barney:,"And... hence new identities.
"
6,21,45,Ted from 2030:,"And so Barney's dad finally showed up.
"
6,21,46,Barney:,"Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.
"
6,21,47,Marshall:,"Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.
"
6,21,48,Barney:,"Lily, his wife.
"
6,21,49,Lily:,"Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.
"
6,21,50,Jerry:,"That's... a little depressing.
"
6,21,51,Ted:,"Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.
"
6,21,52,Robin:,"Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.
"
6,21,53,Barney:,"Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.
"
6,21,54,ROBIN:,"Two, three, four!
"
6,21,55,Jerry:,"So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?
"
6,21,56,Barney:,"Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...
"
6,21,57,Marshall:,"Um, those places shut down a long time ago.
"
6,21,58,Barney:,"Oh, no.
"
6,21,59,Marshall:,"Oh, No shut down, too.
"
6,21,60,Ted:,"There's Where?
"
6,21,61,Jerry:,"Where's Where?
"
6,21,62,Lily:,"Where's where Was was, isn't it?
"
6,21,63,Barney:,"No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?
"
6,21,64,Jerry:,"Okay.
"
6,21,65,Ted:,"Not Okay. That place is lame.
"
6,21,66,Robin:,"Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?
"
6,21,67,Marshall:,"That's wrong. That's not Wrong.
"
6,21,68,Barney:,"Guys, focus.
"
6,21,69,Robin:,"Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.
"
6,21,70,Ted:,"Where?
"
6,21,71,Robin:,"Not Where. Focus.
"
6,21,72,Lily:,"I thought Focus was closed.
"
6,21,73,Barney:,"No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.
"
6,21,74,Marshall:,"So Closed is open.
"
6,21,75,Robin:,"No, Closed is closed.
"
6,21,76,Jerry:,"I don't know. Third base! Right?
"
6,21,77,Robin:,"Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.
"
6,21,78,Jerry:,"I'll go anyplace, okay?
"
6,21,79,Ted:,"Not Okay. Okay is lame.
"
6,21,80,Robin:,"Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.
"
6,21,81,Lily:,"Guys, shut up.
"
6,21,82,Barney:,"No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.
"
6,21,83,Marshall:,"Guys, just pick a club, okay?
"
6,21,84,Ted:,"Not Okay!
"
6,21,85,All:,"Okay is Lame! Gay bar.
"
6,21,86,Marshall:,"For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lamé.
"
6,21,87,Barney:,"It's hopeless, isn't it?
"
6,21,88,Marshall:,"Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.
"
6,21,89,Barney:,"I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!
"
6,21,90,Jerry:,"I might be allergic to this stamp.
"
6,21,91,Robin:,"Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.
"
6,21,92,Lily:,"Mila Kunis?!
"
6,21,93,Robin:,"No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.
"
6,21,94,Man:,"Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?
"
6,21,95,Robin:,"Uh... no. (laughs) The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.
"
6,21,96,Man:,"I was trying on the pants.
"
6,21,97,Robin:,"Oh. (Laughs)
"
6,21,98,Robin:,"I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.
"
6,21,99,Man:,"Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?
"
6,21,100,Robin:,"Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.
"
6,21,101,Man:,"I should be so lucky.
"
6,21,102,Ted:,"Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.
"
6,21,103,Man:,"Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.
"
6,21,104,Robin:,"Mm-hmm. You, too.
"
6,21,105,Man:,"Yeah.
"
6,21,106,"Ted, whispering to Robin:","You owe me one.
"
6,21,107,Barney:,"Man, isn't this place great?
"
6,21,108,Jerry:,"Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!
"
6,21,109,Marshall:,"And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.
"
6,21,110,Barney:,"Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.
"
6,21,111,Lily:,"Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shoots and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.
"
6,21,112,Jerry:,"My goodness!
"
6,21,113,Marshall:,"I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even.
"
6,21,114,Lily:,"Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.
"
6,21,115,Marshall:,"Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!
"
6,21,116,Lily:,"I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your ""real job.""
"
6,21,117,Marshall:,"I won a Tony!
"
6,21,118,Lily:,"I brought French cooking to America!
"
6,21,119,Marshall:,"What?
"
6,21,120,Barney:,"Let's do shots.
"
6,21,121,Jerry:,"Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.
"
6,21,122,Barney:,"No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? ""Never stop partying.""
"
6,21,123,"Jerry, looking horrified:","I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.
"
6,21,124,Barney:,"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?
"
6,21,125,Jerry:,"But I want to hang out with you.
"
6,21,126,Barney:,"Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.
"
6,21,127,Jerry:,"Fine. You want Crazy Jerry? (He drinks four shots) There! You got him! I apologize... it might take a few minutes to kick in.
"
6,21,128,All:,"Oh...
"
6,21,129,Jerry:,"Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!
"
6,21,130,Barney:,"Can you believe it? This is awesome!
"
6,21,131,Robin:,"Barney, how is that awesome?
"
6,21,132,Barney:,"I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.
"
6,21,133,Marshall:,"So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?
"
6,21,134,Lily:,"Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.
"
6,21,135,Marhsall:,"Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have s*x in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have s*x in the bathroom.
"
6,21,136,Lily:,"So our usual wager. Deal.
"
6,21,137,Barney:,"Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?
"
6,21,138,Jerry:,"Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?
"
6,21,139,Barney:,"No, of course not. I... I just...
"
6,21,140,Jerry:,"Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!
"
6,21,141,Barney:,"Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!
"
6,21,142,Robin:,"Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.
"
6,21,143,Ted:,"Okay. ""I would have stolen you a whole orchestra."" There. What's the rush?
"
6,21,144,Robin:,"Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?
"
6,21,145,Ted:,"Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.
"
6,21,146,Robin:,"A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?
"
6,21,147,Ted:,"Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.
"
6,21,148,Robin:,"You're a doofus and a half.
"
6,21,149,Ted:,"Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?
"
6,21,150,Robin:,"At a close-out sale at Dawes.
"
6,21,151,Ted:,"Really? I remember that sale.
"
6,21,152,Ted:,"Hey, Robin.
"
6,21,153,Robin:,"Oh, Ted. Oh, no.
"
6,21,154,Ted:,"Look what I just bought. Right? Right? (He is wearing the Red Boots)
"
6,21,155,Ted:,"Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great s*x that night. Great s*x.
"
6,21,156,Ted:,"Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. (imitating gunshots)
"
6,21,157,Robin:,"Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.
"
6,21,158,Ted:,"All right.
"
6,21,159,Robin:,"All right. Whoa, stop.
"
6,21,160,Ted:,"What?
"
6,21,161,Robin:,"Stop. Perfect.
"
6,21,162,Ted:,"But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.
"
6,21,163,Robin:,"Yeah. Yeah, just like that.
"
6,21,164,Ted:,"You were picturing your crush!
"
6,21,165,Robin:,"Well, somebody had to.
"
6,21,166,Ted:,"Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?
"
6,21,167,Robin:,"Yes.
"
6,21,168,"Ted, loudly:","You hear that, everybody? She said ""yes""! We're getting married! (Ted chuckles) I love this girl. I'm never letting her go.
"
6,21,169,Jerry:,"Hey... Bottoms up, amigo!
"
6,21,170,Ted from 2030:,"After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy.
"
6,21,171,"Jerry, to a big tattoed biker:","You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!
"
6,21,172,Barney:,"(laughing): Hey, hey! There we go!
"
6,21,173,Jerry:,"Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!
"
6,21,174,Barney:,"Oh...!
"
6,21,175,Jerry:,"I just puked on the hood of that... police car! (Laughing)
"
6,21,176,Jerry:,"Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.
"
6,21,177,Barney:,"It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...
"
6,21,178,Jerry:,"Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!
"
6,21,179,Barney:,"What?
"
6,21,180,Jerry:,"I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise.
"
6,21,181,Jerry:,"Here you go.
"
6,21,182,"Barney, laughing:","Whoa!
"
6,21,183,Jerry:,"Bottoms up, amigo!
"
6,21,184,Barney:,"But all those crazy things you did.
"
6,21,185,Jerry:,"Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?
"
6,21,186,Barney:,"A drunk audience.
"
6,21,187,"Jerry, to a dummy wearing a biker outfit:","You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!
"
6,21,188,Barney:,"No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!
"
6,21,189,Jerry:,"Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!
"
6,21,190,Barney:,"Oh...!
"
6,21,191,Barney:,"What just happened?
"
6,21,192,Jerry:,"I... I just puked on the hood of that... (siren blares)...police car.
"
6,21,193,Barney:,"Well, why do all those things?
"
6,21,194,Jerry:,"I figured if I showed you what... ""never stop partying"" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever. (sighs heavily) Oh, well.
"
6,21,195,Barney:,"You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!
"
6,21,196,Jerry:,"I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.
"
6,21,197,Barney:,"Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.
"
6,21,198,Jerry:,"Perhaps.
"
6,21,199,Barney:,"Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too. (They escape and run away) Abracadabra!
"
6,21,200,Woman:,"Congratulations!
"
6,21,201,Robin:,"Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (laughs) Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?
"
6,21,202,"Ted, chuckling:","Wow. Wardrobe malfunction at the O.K. Corral! I mean, who in their right mind would ever...
"
6,21,203,Woman:,"You would look so totally hot in those.
"
6,21,204,Ted:,"Do you have these in a size 11?
"
6,21,205,Robin:,"So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint.
"
6,21,206,Marshall:,"Hello.
"
6,21,207,Robin:,"I, uh... Oh.
"
6,21,208,Marshall:,"Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?
"
6,21,209,Barney:,"We need someplace to hide.
"
6,21,210,Jerry:,"Where?
"
6,21,211,Barney:,"No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.
"
6,21,212,Jerry:,"Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.
"
6,21,213,Barney:,"Step on it! Jerry...
"
6,21,214,Jerry:,"Do not step on it.
"
6,21,215,Barney:,"Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.
"
6,21,216,Jerry:,"The laws are there to protect...
"
6,21,217,Barney:,"This is no time for laws!
"
6,21,218,Jerry:,"Buckle up, Barney.
"
6,21,219,Barney:,"I am not going to buckle up!
"
6,21,220,Jerry:,"I am your father! You will listen to me!
"
6,21,221,Ted:,"Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?
"
6,21,222,Lily:,"I won that race. My prize... s*x in the bathroom.
"
6,21,223,Marshall:,"And I won that race.
"
6,21,224,Lily:,"Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.
"
6,21,225,Robin:,"Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
"
6,21,226,Lily:,"Why are you smiling?
"
6,21,227,Robin:,"I don't know. Good night.
"
6,21,228,"Man, on the phone:","Saw that girl again. And guess what? She's engaged. So that's the end of that.
"
6,21,229,Ted from 2030:,"It wasn't the end of that. More on that later
"
6,21,230,Man:,"And her fiancé? The guy's like a two.
"
6,21,231,Barney:,"How did you do it?
"
6,21,232,Jerry:,"Do what?
"
6,21,233,Barney:,"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...
"
6,21,234,Jerry:,"You're drifting.
"
6,21,235,Barney:,"Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...
"
6,21,236,Jerry:,"No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.
"
6,21,237,Barney:,"When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.
"
6,21,238,Jerry:,"Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.
"
6,21,239,Barney:,"o how do you do it?
"
6,21,240,Jerry:,"A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.
"
6,21,241,Barney:,"aybe I've met her already.
"
6,21,242,Jerry:,"And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.
"
6,21,243,Barney:,"aybe some other time.
"
6,21,244,Jerry:,"Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.
"
6,21,245,Barney:,"'m going fishing with my dad.
"
6,21,246,Barney:,"This... sucks.
"
6,23,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, this is a story of landmarks. There are certain moments in life when you have to decide which things you can stand to see torn down, and which things you have to preserve, no matter what. Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where the fate of The Arcadian would be decided once and for all.
"
6,23,2,Marshall:,"A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember: if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well. Did you like that? All right, uh... We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size... If you want New York's history at your beck and call...
"
6,23,3,Chairman:,"All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.
"
6,23,4,Marshall:,"I just have...
"
6,23,5,Chairman:,"We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?...Okay, it's killing me. What rhymes with ""beck and call?""
"
6,23,6,Marshall:,"Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.
"
6,23,7,Audience:,"Ah...
"
6,23,8,Marshall:,"Thank you.
"
6,23,9,Chairman:,"Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question.
"
6,23,10,Ted from 2030:,"Actually, it a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said...
"
6,23,11,Ted:,"""Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."" And then the crowd gasps: ""Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!""
"
6,23,12,Zoey:,"So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?
"
6,23,13,Ted:,"Almost exclusively. But here's my point: If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say ""yes""?
"
6,23,14,Zoey:,"That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.
"
6,23,15,Marshall:,"I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.
"
6,23,16,Zoey:,"Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like...
"
6,23,17,Marshall:,"Nice.
"
6,23,18,Robin:,"I have a message from Barney.
"
6,23,19,Ted from 2030:,"Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened.
"
6,23,20,Zoey:,"Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.
"
6,23,21,Ted from 2030:,"And then this happened.
"
6,23,22,Zoey:,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!
"
6,23,23,Ted:,"Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.
"
6,23,24,Ted from 2030:,"Which led to this happening.
"
6,23,25,Zoey:,"Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you.
"
6,23,26,Ted:,"Mmm. Love you, too.
"
6,23,27,Lily:,"All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...
"
6,23,28,Robin:,"Yeah, I have that, too.
"
6,23,29,Lily:,"Damn it.
"
6,23,30,Robin:,"All right, here's the message. (clears throat, then reads Barney's note) ""Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and..."" Really? ""Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. (Barney licks his hot wings peace by peace then throws them down) Do evil laugh."" Oh, um... (makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh) So, what are you turds up to?
"
6,23,31,Marshall:,"Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.
"
6,23,32,Ted:,"Why does it need to rhyme?
"
6,23,33,Marshall:,"If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.
"
6,23,34,Lily:,"Yeah. It's why in our apartment: If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor.
"
6,23,35,Marshall:,"And she hasn't since.
"
6,23,36,Barney:,"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?
"
6,23,37,Marshall:,"Nailed it.
"
6,23,38,Barney:,"Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?
"
6,23,39,Ted:,"It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.
"
6,23,40,Barney:,"I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.
"
6,23,41,Ted:,"What?
"
6,23,42,Barney:,"Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...
"
6,23,43,Lily:,"I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.
"
6,23,44,Barney:,"I once knew such a girl.
"
6,23,45,Barney:,"It was last call. In this very bar.
"
6,23,46,Barney:,"What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!
"
6,23,47,Robin:,"Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.
"
6,23,48,Ted:,"Barney, this is about the building.
"
6,23,49,Barney:,"Come on. This is so about the girl.
"
6,23,50,Ted:,"Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.
"
6,23,51,Lily:,"Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?
"
6,23,52,Ted:,"Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.
"
6,23,53,Barney:,"Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be. (laughing harder and louder) That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.
"
6,23,54,Ted from 2030:,"Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard.
"
6,23,55,Barney:,"Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?
"
6,23,56,Arthur:,"No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.
"
6,23,57,Barney:,"Isn't that animal cruelty?
"
6,23,58,Arthur:,"I'm talking about my wife.
"
6,23,59,Barney:,"Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?
"
6,23,60,Arthur:,"Yeah, I know your friend Ted.
"
6,23,61,Barney:,"So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you? (laughing uncomfortably) Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...
"
6,23,62,Arthur:,"No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you.
"
6,23,63,Barney:,"Come again for Big Fudge?
"
6,23,64,Barney:,"Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.
"
6,23,65,Robin:,"I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?
"
6,23,66,Barney:,"I don't understand. Why would you fire me?
"
6,23,67,Arthur:,"Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?
"
6,23,68,Barney:,"By being the best architect available?
"
6,23,69,Arthur:,"No.
"
6,23,70,Barney:,"By... being Latino?
"
6,23,71,Arthur:,"No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.
"
6,23,72,Barney:,"Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.
"
6,23,73,Barney:,"Damn it! I was kidding?
"
6,23,74,Barney:,"I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?
"
6,23,75,Arthur:,"Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done.
"
6,23,76,Both:,"Damn it!
"
6,23,77,Arthur:,"No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.
"
6,23,78,Ted:,"They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.
"
6,23,79,Marshall:,"And he's been doing it for years.
"
6,23,80,Lily:,"Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?
"
6,23,81,Ted:,"No idea.
"
6,23,82,Marshall:,"He has a lot of keys.
"
6,23,83,Robin:,"Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...
"
6,23,84,Ted:,"There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.
"
6,23,85,Robin:,"Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.
"
6,23,86,Robin:,"The chairman asks you...
"
6,23,87,Chairman:,"Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?
"
6,23,88,Robin:,"You say...
"
6,23,89,Ted:,"No.
"
6,23,90,Robin:,"And Zoey dumps you on the spot.
"
6,23,91,Zoey:,"We're done here.
"
6,23,92,Robin:,"There's the second scenario.
"
6,23,93,Robin:,"The chairman asks you...
"
6,23,94,Chairman:,"Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?
"
6,23,95,Robin:,"You say...
"
6,23,96,Ted:,"Yes
"
6,23,97,Robin:,"And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.
"
6,23,98,Ted:,"We're done here.
"
6,23,99,Ted:,"You said there was a third scenario.
"
6,23,100,Robin:,"Right.
"
6,23,101,Robin:,"The chairman asks you...
"
6,23,102,Chairman:,"Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?
"
6,23,103,Robin:,"But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.
"
6,23,104,Robin:,"That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.
"
6,23,105,Ted:,"Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... (Robin slaps him by surprise)
"
6,23,106,Lily:,"Tree?
"
6,23,107,Ted:,"Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.
"
6,23,108,Lily:,"I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.
"
6,23,109,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
6,23,110,Lily:,"I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.
"
6,23,111,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
6,23,112,Ted from 2030:,"That night, as I slept soundly...
"
6,23,113,Ted:,"Barney, what are you doing?
"
6,23,114,Ghost:,"Who is this Barney? My name is John Clifford Larrabee, architect of The Arcadian. And I am visiting you in a dream...
"
6,23,115,Ted:,"Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.
"
6,23,116,Ghost:,"Look, it's a dream, it is. So just... okay? Theodore... heed my words: do not try to save The Arcadian.
"
6,23,117,Ted:,"Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.
"
6,23,118,"Ghost, shouting dramatically:","I am not... Barney...
"
6,23,119,Ted:,"Whoa! Lighting change!
"
6,23,120,Ghost:,"Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built, architecturally unimportant rat's nest designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs. This guy.
"
6,23,121,Ted:,"Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.
"
6,23,122,Ghost:,"New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn.
"
6,23,123,Ted:,"The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?
"
6,23,124,Ghost:,"Indeed.
"
6,23,125,Ted:,"You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.
"
6,23,126,Ghost:,"Mo' buildings, mo' problems.
"
6,23,127,Ted:,"This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...
"
6,23,128,Ghost:,"Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.
"
6,23,129,"Ted, panting:","Dream! Dream! It was just a dream. (He takes his breath again, then phones Zoey) Hey. I know it's late, but, uh... you want to meet up?
"
6,23,130,Zoey:,"Hello, Mr. Lion.
"
6,23,131,Ted:,"""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair""""
"
6,23,132,Zoey:,"Hey, I met you right...(laughs)...here.
"
6,23,133,Ted:,"Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.
"
6,23,134,Zoey:,"As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab.
"
6,23,135,Ted:,"Worth every penny.
"
6,23,136,Zoey:,"All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet...
"
6,23,137,Ted:,"No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.
"
6,23,138,Zoey:,"Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save.
"
6,23,139,Ted:,"Exactly.
"
6,23,140,Zoey:,"You okay?
"
6,23,141,Ted:,"Yeah. Good night.
"
6,23,142,Chairman:,"Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark?
"
6,23,143,Ted:,"No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.
"
6,23,144,Zoey:,"E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? (She plays a recorder)
"
6,23,145,"Ted, on recorder:","The Arcadian should be a landmark. It should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of... wieners and gonads.
"
6,23,146,Chairman:,"Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?
"
6,23,147,Ted:,"Yeah, that's me.
"
6,23,148,Ted:,"This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...
"
6,23,149,Robin:,"They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.
"
6,23,150,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
6,23,151,Barney:,"We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.
"
6,23,152,Marshall:,"Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.
"
6,23,153,Ted:,"What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.
"
6,23,154,Barney:,"We should totally buy a bar!
"
6,23,155,Marshall:,"We should absolutely totally buy a bar!
"
6,23,156,Robin:,"It's really the only sensible idea right now.
"
6,23,157,Marshall:,"Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.
"
6,23,158,Ted:,"Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.
"
6,23,159,Marshall:,"I'll allow it!
"
6,23,160,Barney:,"The only court where you show up, then get served.
"
6,23,161,Robin:,"Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.
"
6,23,162,Ted:,"That's not bad.
"
6,23,163,Lily:,"Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.
"
6,23,164,Ted:,"Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.
"
6,23,165,Marshall:,"I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen. (Lily starts to jiggle) And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?
"
6,23,166,Barney:,"Oh, this ought to be good.
"
6,23,167,Ted from 2030:,"And then Lily told us her plan.
"
6,23,168,Barney:,"Oh, this is good!
"
6,23,169,Ted:,"We have to find Arthur right now.
"
6,23,170,Arthur:,"What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!
"
6,23,171,Barney:,"Hey, Arthur!
"
6,23,172,Robin:,"Oh, cute dog!
"
6,23,173,Arthur:,"No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!
"
6,23,174,Barney:,"Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.
"
6,23,175,Arthur:,"Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!
"
6,23,176,Barney:,"Uh... Hey, Arthur?
"
6,23,177,Arthur:,"I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?
"
6,23,178,Lily:,"Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.
"
6,23,179,Barney and Ted:,"Dibs.
"
6,23,180,Arthur:,"Fine! What's the idea?
"
6,23,181,Lily:,"Well...
"
6,23,182,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict.
"
6,23,183,Chairman:,"Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore... Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it... a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework...disappeared. So... that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied.
"
6,23,184,Ted:,"Zoey... Zoey!
"
6,23,185,Zoey:,"All right, what do you have to say for yourself?
"
6,23,186,Ted:,"I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.
"
6,23,187,Zoey:,"We're done here.
"
6,23,188,Ted:,"Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.
"
6,23,189,Barney:,"I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet. (He takes out a normal size screw driver) I hope I used the right screws.
"
6,22,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, when your Uncle Marshall finally quit Goliath National Bank to do something better with his life, he left on great terms with his boss.
"
6,22,2,Arthur:,"Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference.
"
6,22,3,Ted from 2030:,"Which made Marshall's big interview with a respected environmental organization all the more confusing.
"
6,22,4,Head of the environmental Organization:,"I'm sorry. I don't think you're the kind of person we're looking for. I just got off the phone with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB.
"
6,22,5,Arthur:,"Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen... at least I did when he actually showed up.
"
6,22,6,Arthur:,"Marshall! Hey, it's, uh, it's 2:30. If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it if you'd try to get here at least before lunch.
"
6,22,7,Marshall:,"Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.
"
6,22,8,Assistant:,"Oh! Mr. Eriksen... You're not wearing any pants.
"
6,22,9,Marshall:,"Your move.
"
6,22,10,Assistant:,"But Marshall, wh... What about the environment?
"
6,22,11,Marshall:,"Screw the environment!
"
6,22,12,Head of the environmental Organization:,"""Screw the environment""?!
"
6,22,13,Arthur:,"Oh, yeah. We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent racist.
"
6,22,14,Marshall:,"Sir, none of that is...
"
6,22,15,Head of the environmental Organization:,"Sorry. Interview over.
"
6,22,16,Ted from 2030:,"And so Marshall stormed over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey.
"
6,22,17,Zoey:,"If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.
"
6,22,18,Barney:,"Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to ""Hot For Teacher."" Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.
"
6,22,19,Robin:,"Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.
"
6,22,20,Barney:,"Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...
"
6,22,21,Ted:,"Dude, that's my girlfriend.
"
6,22,22,Barney:,"Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?
"
6,22,23,Ted:,"You know it.
"
6,22,24,Lily:,"Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.
"
6,22,25,Barney:,"Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.
"
6,22,26,Lily:,"Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?
"
6,22,27,Ted:,"At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it: we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company.
"
6,22,28,Lily:,"So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?
"
6,22,29,Ted:,"Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.
"
6,22,30,Zoey:,"Hey, guys.
"
6,22,31,All:,"Hey!
"
6,22,32,Zoey:,"Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.
"
6,22,33,Ted:,"So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?
"
6,22,34,Robin:,"Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now.
"
6,22,35,Zoey:,"Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down.
"
6,22,36,Marshall:,"Yeah, totally.
"
6,22,37,Ted:,"So, they found water on Mars. What?
"
6,22,38,Marshall:,"Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?
"
6,22,39,Barney:,"Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?
"
6,22,40,Lily:,"That was on purpose!
"
6,22,41,Barney:,"I mean this is really like...
"
6,22,42,Marshall:,"Barney, please...
"
6,22,43,Ted from 2030:,"And thus began an all-out war between Barney and Marshall...
"
6,22,44,Delivery Guy:,"Delivery from Mr. Stinson.
"
6,22,45,Zoey:,"Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?!
"
6,22,46,Marshall:,"Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
6,22,47,Ted from 2030:,"Later, back at the bar... another war was just beginning.
"
6,22,48,Lily:,"Babe, can I get you a drink?
"
6,22,49,Marshall:,"No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet.
"
6,22,50,Lily:,"I know.
"
6,22,51,Marshall:,"You know what? Screw this. Game on.
"
6,22,52,Lily:,"Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by.
"
6,22,53,Robin:,"That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.
"
6,22,54,Lily:,"The walk-by with the stink eye.
"
6,22,55,"Robin, in a high-pitched voice:","A stink-eye-walk-by?! Aw, hell no! I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed.
"
6,22,56,Marshall:,"Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!
"
6,22,57,Barney:,"No. I' was... I was...
"
6,22,58,Ted from 2030:,"This went on for days.
"
6,22,59,"Marshall, to the girl Barney is talking to:","Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.
"
6,22,60,Barney:,"Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. (The girl leaves)
"
6,22,61,Marshall:,"Oh, bye-bye.
"
6,22,62,Marshall:,"Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. (The girl leaves in a hurry)
"
6,22,63,Lily:,"Oh, boy. Look who's back.
"
6,22,64,Robin:,"Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style ""All Night Long""?
"
6,22,65,Lily:,"Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho.
"
6,22,66,Marshall:,"Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.
"
6,22,67,Barney:,"Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?
"
6,22,68,Marshall:,"That's it!
"
6,22,69,Barney:,"Kent! Kent!
"
6,22,70,Marshall:,"Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!
"
6,22,71,Barney:,"That's what you get, you traitor!
"
6,22,72,Marshall:,"Oh, really? Really?
"
6,22,73,Barney:,"Yeah. Really.
"
6,22,74,Marshall:,"Really. That... what...
"
6,22,75,Carl:,"Okay, enough! You guys are out of here.
"
6,22,76,Robin:,"Ejected!
"
6,22,77,Carl:,"I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out!
"
6,22,78,Robin:,"Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. (The girls stand up and leave the booth; the other girl sits down at their booth) Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on.
"
6,22,79,Lily:,"This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.
"
6,22,80,Robin:,"Man, what are we going to do without her?
"
6,22,81,Lily:,"Oh...
"
6,22,82,Robin:,"Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.
"
6,22,83,Lily:,"Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?
"
6,22,84,Robin:,"Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.
"
6,22,85,All:,"Ten, nine, eight...
"
6,22,86,Barney:,"I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.
"
6,22,87,All:,"Happy New Year!
"
6,22,88,Robin:,"If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.
"
6,22,89,Lily:,"Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.
"
6,22,90,Marshall:,"Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.
"
6,22,91,Lily:,"How about martinis?
"
6,22,92,Robin:,"Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.
"
6,22,93,Lily:,"Why not?
"
6,22,94,Lily:,"Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.
"
6,22,95,Robin:,"Every time.
"
6,22,96,Lily:,"I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...
"
6,22,97,Robin:,"Uh-huh.
"
6,22,98,Lily:,"Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?
"
6,22,99,Marshall:,"I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...
"
6,22,100,Robin:,"We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.
"
6,22,101,Lily:,"I keep telling you, that didn't happen.
"
6,22,102,Robin:,"It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?
"
6,22,103,Lily:,"Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.
"
6,22,104,"Marshall, talking to a mirror:","Hey. I dare you guys to dare us to make out.
"
6,22,105,Ted:,"Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?
"
6,22,106,Lily:,"Peppermint schnapps?
"
6,22,107,Robin:,"No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.
"
6,22,108,Lily:,"Who?
"
6,22,109,Robin:,"The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.
"
6,22,110,Barney:,"Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...
"
6,22,111,Ted:,"Hey, where are our chicken wings?
"
6,22,112,Barney:,"Show me chicken wings!
"
6,22,113,All:,"Good order, Ted! Good order!
"
6,22,114,Ted:,"Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.
"
6,22,115,Lily:,"Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?
"
6,22,116,Ted:,"Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing.
"
6,22,117,Ted:,"Peace, I'm out.
"
6,22,118,Lily:,"Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.
"
6,22,119,Ted:,"Peace. I'm out.
"
6,22,120,Ted:,"You had to take that away from me, didn't you? (He takes a bottle of Bourbon out of his bag and put it on the table)
"
6,22,121,Robin:,"Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.
"
6,22,122,Ted:,"What do you mean?
"
6,22,123,Lily:,"Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.
"
6,22,124,Robin:,"Stop.
"
6,22,125,Ted:,"Man, how did things get so screwed up?
"
6,22,126,Ted from 2030:,"Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits.
"
6,22,127,Ted:,"You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?
"
6,22,128,Zoey:,"I thought we weren't talking about...
"
6,22,129,Ted:,"We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?
"
6,22,130,Zoey:,"Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?
"
6,22,131,Ted:,"Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.
"
6,22,132,Zoey:,"You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel.
"
6,22,133,Ted:,"Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.
"
6,22,134,Zoey:,"Okay.
"
6,22,135,Lily:,"We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?
"
6,22,136,Robin:,"Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?
"
6,22,137,Lily:,"I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.
"
6,22,138,Barney:,"Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?
"
6,22,139,Marshall:,"Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?
"
6,22,140,Barney:,"What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?
"
6,22,141,Marshall:,"I showed up with wet hair once! Once!
"
6,22,142,Barney:,"Oh, my God.
"
6,22,143,Ted:,"Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.
"
6,22,144,Zoey:,"You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow.
"
6,22,145,Ted:,"That's not a chocolate.
"
6,22,146,Robin:,"Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.
"
6,22,147,Lily:,"Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.
"
6,22,148,Marshall:,"See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.
"
6,22,149,Barney:,"Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...
"
6,22,150,Marshall:,"Oh God, I didn't even think of that...
"
6,22,151,Barney:,"It made me wonder, ""What could I have done to make him stay?""
"
6,22,152,Marshall:,"Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.
"
6,22,153,Barney:,"That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.
"
6,22,154,Robin:,"Wow. That got real o'clock.
"
6,22,155,Lily:,"Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.
"
6,22,156,Robin:,"Dance, my puppets, dance!
"
6,22,157,Lily:,"Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?
"
6,22,158,Robin:,"Oh, God, totally!
"
6,22,159,Zoey:,"Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me?
"
6,22,160,Ted:,"Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?
"
6,22,161,Ted:,"What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?
"
6,22,162,Woman:,"This bathroom for entire floor!
"
6,22,163,Lily:,"Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?
"
6,22,164,Robin:,"Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?
"
6,22,165,Lily:,"Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.
"
6,22,166,Robin:,"What? What is it?
"
6,22,167,Lily:,"What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?
"
6,22,168,Barney:,"Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.
"
6,22,169,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, don't drink tequila.
"
6,22,170,Ted:,"Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man.
"
6,22,171,Zoey:,"I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty.
"
6,22,172,Ted:,"Okay. What is it? And don't give me, ""It's beautiful."" Don't give me, ""It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?
"
6,22,173,Zoey:,"Well... When I was a little girl... my family used to live here.
"
6,22,174,Ted:,"Why, why have you never told me that?
"
6,22,175,Zoey:,"I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too.
"
6,22,176,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, you never forget the first time or place you tell a girl:
"
6,22,177,Ted:,"I love you.
"
6,22,178,Zoey:,"I love you, too.
"
6,22,179,Carl:,"Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up.
"
6,22,180,Robin:,"Well, what drink finally did the trick?
"
6,22,181,Robin & Lily:,"Of course, beer.
"
6,22,182,Marshall:,"I love you.
"
6,22,183,Barney:,"I love you.
"
6,22,184,Barney:,"Uh, no. N-Not right...
"
6,22,185,Ted:,"You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.
"
6,22,186,Zoey:,"See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former... What was that?
"
6,22,187,Ted:,"What was what?
"
6,22,188,Zoey:,"I think it went under the bed.
"
6,22,189,Ted:,"I don't see anything.
"
6,22,190,Zoey:,"That, that was... that!
"
6,22,191,Ted:,"Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!
"
6,22,192,Zoey:,"The what?
"
6,22,193,Ted:,"Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.
"
6,22,194,Zoey:,"Ew.... I give up. You win. Let's go!
"
6,22,195,Lily:,"Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.
"
6,22,196,Robin:,"Morning. Who wants breakfast?
"
6,22,197,Barney:,"You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?
"
6,22,198,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!
"
6,22,199,Lily:,"I thought they made up last night.
"
6,22,200,Robin:,"Damn it, I know what happened.
"
6,22,201,Marshall:,"I love you.
"
6,22,202,Barney:,"I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...
"
6,22,203,Lily:,"Carl, a round of champagne.
"
6,22,204,Lily:,"Ooh! The champagne.
"
6,22,205,Robin:,"We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.
"
6,22,206,Barney:,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?
"
6,22,207,Ted:,"Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.
"
6,22,208,Barney:,"Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...
"
6,22,209,Robin:,"Okay, what drink can fix this?
"
6,22,210,Lily:,"Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?
"
6,22,211,Robin:,"I got it.
"
6,22,212,Robin:,"Right?
"
6,22,213,Lily:,"Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make...
"
6,22,214,Woman:,"What is that?
"
6,19,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, I bought the house we live in now way back before I ever met your mother. It needed a lot of work, but I had a vision for it.
"
6,19,2,Ted:,"Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.
"
6,19,3,Barney:,"Ted. This is your seduction lounge. s*x swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...
"
6,19,4,Marshall:,"Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.
"
6,19,5,Lily:," We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.
"
6,19,6,Barney:,"Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.
"
6,19,7,Ted:,"Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you
"
6,19,8,Ted from 2030:,"Why did Barney need an intervention? It all started a few nights earlier.
"
6,19,9,Marshall:,"Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.
"
6,19,10,Ted:,"Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?
"
6,19,11,Barney:,"Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.
"
6,19,12,Lily:," You call the super for a screwdriver?
"
6,19,13,Barney:,"Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.
"
6,19,14,Ted:,"Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.
"
6,19,15,Barney:,"Well, here's our screwdriver now. (Barney opens the door, then whispers loudly:) Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.
"
6,19,16,Jerry:,"Barney, I... I got your letter.
"
6,19,17,Barney:,"Dad?
"
6,19,18,Marshall:,"I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.
"
6,19,19,Robin:,"Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?
"
6,19,20,Lily:," ""So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls""?
"
6,19,21,Ted:,"Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.
"
6,19,22,Robin:,"Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.
"
6,19,23,Ted:,"Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.
"
6,19,24,Robin:,"Really? I seem to recall...
"
6,19,25,Ted:,"Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.
"
6,19,26,Student:,"Um, Professor? Uh, do you mean ""chameleon""?
"
6,19,27,Ted:,"Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced ""chamma-leeon,"" so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.
"
6,19,28,Ted:,"Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.
"
6,19,29,Robin:,"Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ""ch-aracter"" to admit that.
"
6,19,30,Ted:,"Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.
"
6,19,31,Robin:,"You want to tussle? Let's tussle.
"
6,19,32,Ted:,"Marine biologist.
"
6,19,33,Robin:,"Please, no.
"
6,19,34,Scott:,"So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months.
"
6,19,35,Robin:,"Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.
"
6,19,36,Scott:,"Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of...
"
6,19,37,Robin:,"Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!
"
6,19,38,Scott:,"Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right?
"
6,19,39,Robin:,"So... you want to get pizza later? Or...
"
6,19,40,Scott:,"I think we should break up.
"
6,19,41,Robin:,"I still think about him in the shower.
"
6,19,42,Ted:,"Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?
"
6,19,43,Barney:,"Where do I begin?
"
6,19,44,Jerry (Barney's dad):,"So, I'm not sure how to start this.
"
6,19,45,Barney:,"Yeah. I think I need a drink.
"
6,19,46,Jerry:,"Me, too.
"
6,19,47,Both:,"Glen McKenna, neat.
"
6,19,48,Jerry:,"Nice order. Up top.
"
6,19,49,Barney:,"Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.
"
6,19,50,Jerry:,"Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?
"
6,19,51,Barney:,"I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.
"
6,19,52,Barney:,"Make a muscle.
"
6,19,53,Jerry:,"There you go.
"
6,19,54,Barney:,"Ah!
"
6,19,55,Barney:,"Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.
"
6,19,56,Barney:,"Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?
"
6,19,57,Jerry:,"Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.
"
6,19,58,"Barney, laughing:","You're funny. My dad's funny.
"
6,19,59,Barney:,"So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.
"
6,19,60,Lily:," Why did you abandon me?
"
6,19,61,Marshall:,"Why'd you wait so long to contact me?
"
6,19,62,Robin:,"You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?
"
6,19,63,Barney:,"Do you... get laid a lot?
"
6,19,64,Jerry:,"Big-time. Observe.
"
6,19,65,Barney:,"Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.
"
6,19,66,Jerry:,"Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.
"
6,19,67,Barney:,"You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...
"
6,19,68,Barney:,"..daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.
"
6,19,69,Jerry:,"So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.
"
6,19,70,Barney:,"Oh, that's cool.
"
6,19,71,Jerry:,"Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?
"
6,19,72,Barney:,"This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. (both laughing)
"
6,19,73,Lily:," Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.
"
6,19,74,Barney:,"What do you mean?
"
6,19,75,Ted:,"Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.
"
6,19,76,Robin:,"Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.
"
6,19,77,Barney:,"First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.
"
6,19,78,Ted:,"I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?
"
6,19,79,Lily:," Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.
"
6,19,80,Ted:,"You have gaps, too, Lily.
"
6,19,81,Lily:," You got nothing on me.
"
6,19,82,Marshall:,"Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?
"
6,19,83,Lily:," Sure, honey. (She throws the key toward the wall besides Marshall)
"
6,19,84,Ted:,"You have terrible aim.
"
6,19,85,Lily:," That's not true.
"
6,19,86,Marshall:,"Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.
"
6,19,87,Robin:,"Oh, my God. Barney's dad.
"
6,19,88,Jerry:,"Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right?
"
6,19,89,Marshall:,"Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?
"
6,19,90,Jerry:,"What? No, I... I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help... Barney won't return my calls.
"
6,19,91,Lily:," What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.
"
6,19,92,Jerry:,"That's not what happened.
"
6,19,93,Barney:,"I'm not sure how to start this.
"
6,19,94,Jerry:,"Yeah.
"
6,19,95,Barney:,"I think I need a drink.
"
6,19,96,Jerry:,"Me, too.
"
6,19,97,Barney:,"Glen McKenna, neat.
"
6,19,98,Jerry:,"Milk, skim.
"
6,19,99,Barney:,"Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?
"
6,19,100,Jerry:,"I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.
"
6,19,101,Barney:,"Wow.
"
6,19,102,Jerry:,"I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30.
"
6,19,103,Barney:,"Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?
"
6,19,104,Jerry:,"No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right
"
6,19,105,Barney:,"Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.
"
6,19,106,Jerry:,"Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.
"
6,19,107,Barney:,"Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.
"
6,19,108,Jerry:,"The drugs, the alcohol, the women...
"
6,19,109,Barney:,"Yes, yes, yes.
"
6,19,110,Jerry:,"I was out of control.
"
6,19,111,Barney:,"*Out of control.*
"
6,19,112,Jerry:,"So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.
"
6,19,113,Barney:,"You ever bang Stevie Nicks?
"
6,19,114,Jerry:,"Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.
"
6,19,115,Jerry:,"I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word ""furgling."" It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, ""More quiche! More quiche!"" I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.
"
6,19,116,Jerry:,"I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...
"
6,19,117,Jerry:,"What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.
"
6,19,118,Barney:,"Big-time.
"
6,19,119,Jerry:,"Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.
"
6,19,120,Barney:,"Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son.""
"
6,19,121,Jerry:,"Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.
"
6,19,122,Barney:,"Why?
"
6,19,123,Jerry:,"I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.
"
6,19,124,Barney:,"You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.
"
6,19,125,Jerry:,"I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.
"
6,19,126,Lily:," We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.
"
6,19,127,Barney:,"What?
"
6,19,128,Marshall:,"You're having dinner with him tonight.
"
6,19,129,Barney:,"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.
"
6,19,130,Robin:,"Are you sure it's not more than that?
"
6,19,131,Barney:,"Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.
"
6,19,132,Marshall:,"No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.
"
6,19,133,Barney:,"Fine, I'll go.
"
6,19,134,Marshall:,"Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. (She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees) I'm literally 11 inches from you.
"
6,19,135,Ted from 2030:,"And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance.
"
6,19,136,Cherryl:,"Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.
"
6,19,137,Barney:,"Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.
"
6,19,138,Cherryl:,"Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you.
"
6,19,139,Barney:,"Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.
"
6,19,140,Lily:," Guess now we wait.
"
6,19,141,Marshall:,"Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer: real or fake?
"
6,19,142,Robin:,"Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?
"
6,19,143,Marshall:,"Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.
"
6,19,144,Lily:," What, baby?
"
6,19,145,Marshall:,"You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.
"
6,19,146,Robin:,"That's not true.
"
6,19,147,Lily:," Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.
"
6,19,148,Robin:,"I'm sorry.
"
6,19,149,Marshall:,"I first noticed it at the bar.
"
6,19,150,Marshall:,"Hey, Lily, (his voice cracks) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.
"
6,19,151,Barney:,"It ages well, that's the thing.
"
6,19,152,Marshall:,"You guys like my new soul patch?
"
6,19,153,Robin:,"Righteous hair tab, brotha.
"
6,19,154,Marshall:,"And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. [...]Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.
"
6,19,155,Lily:," I love him.
"
6,19,156,Marshall:,"Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.
"
6,19,157,Lily:," But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.
"
6,19,158,Marshall:,"Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.
"
6,19,159,Jerry:,"J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.
"
6,19,160,Barney:,"I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.
"
6,19,161,Jerry:,"Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid.
"
6,19,162,JJ:,"Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.
"
6,19,163,Barney:,"J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.
"
6,19,164,Marshall:,"Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?
"
6,19,165,Ted:,"Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.
"
6,19,166,Marshall:,"Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, ""do the laundry""
"
6,19,167,Lily:," You can't swallow pills.
"
6,19,168,Robin:,"Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person. (laughs) Right? What?
"
6,19,169,Cherryl:,"So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.
"
6,19,170,Barney:,"Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?
"
6,19,171,JJ:,"I'm 11.
"
6,19,172,Barney:,"Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.
"
6,19,173,Cherryl:,"Actually, J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J.
"
6,19,174,JJ:,"I got a paper route.
"
6,19,175,Barney:,"Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?
"
6,19,176,Jerry:,"Good slam, Barney.
"
6,19,177,Cherryl:,"Jerry.
"
6,19,178,Jerry:,"It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers.
"
6,19,179,Cherryl:,"J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.
"
6,19,180,Barney:,"Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?
"
6,19,181,JJ:,"Fourth period?
"
6,19,182,Barney:,"Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!
"
6,19,183,Jerry:,"Got him again.
"
6,19,184,Cherryl:,"Jerry!
"
6,19,185,Jerry:,"Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.
"
6,19,186,Barney:,"Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?
"
6,19,187,Jerry:,"J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.
"
6,19,188,Barney:,"Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.
"
6,19,189,JJ:,"I like having a brother.
"
6,19,190,Ted:,"You always add too much water to oatmeal.
"
6,19,191,Marshall:,"Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.
"
6,19,192,Robin:,"You consistently miss at least one belt loop.
"
6,19,193,Marshall:,"It's like I'm blind.
"
6,19,194,Lily:," You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.
"
6,19,195,Marshall:,"Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died.
"
6,19,196,Lily:," Aw, honey.
"
6,19,197,Marshall:,"No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.
"
6,19,198,Jerry:,"Barney, what is going on?
"
6,19,199,Barney:,"This is mine.
"
6,19,200,Jerry:,"I don't understand.
"
6,19,201,Barney:,"J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.
"
6,19,202,Jerry:,"Please, just come down and talk to me.
"
6,19,203,Barney:,"Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.
"
6,19,204,Jerry:,"Why does that make you so mad?
"
6,19,205,Barney:,"Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!
"
6,19,206,Jerry:,"Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...
"
6,19,207,Barney:,"Oh, ""screwed up"" doesn't even begin to describe...
"
6,19,208,Jerry:,"I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.
"
6,19,209,Barney:,"Can you help me with this?
"
6,19,210,Jerry:,"Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.
"
6,19,211,Barney:,"Bye.
"
6,19,212,Lily:," Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?
"
6,19,213,Barney:,"I'm fine. Hey, Ted.
"
6,19,214,Ted:,"Yeah, buddy.
"
6,19,215,Barney:,"You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?
"
6,19,216,Ted:,"Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.
"
6,19,217,Barney:,"No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.
"
6,24,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in the spring of 2011, Zoey and I broke up. But the good news: Goliath National Bank was finally ready to demolish The Arcadian and build the new headquarters I'd designed for them. (A committee, including Ted holding a big pair of scissors, is standing behind a red ruban. Ted is going to cut it, when a very happy Barney arrives with a bigger pair of scissors and cut the ruban before Ted can) The only problem was... I kept butting heads with my project supervisor on one very important issue.
"
6,24,2,Ted:,"I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!
"
6,24,3,Barney:,"I want to press it!
"
6,24,4,Ted:,"I want to press it!
"
6,24,5,Barney:,"I want to press it!
"
6,24,6,Robin:,"Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, ""Baby, that was great"""" and go to sleep.
"
6,24,7,"Both Ted and Barney, at the same time:","She means you. I want to press it! I'm gonna press it!
"
6,24,8,Robin:,"It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?
"
6,24,9,Ted:,"Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.
"
6,24,10,Robin:,"That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?
"
6,24,11,Zoey:,"I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates.
"
6,24,12,Ted:,"Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.
"
6,24,13,Zoey:,"They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win.
"
6,24,14,Ted:,"Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.
"
6,24,15,Zoey:,"Hey. You want to get coffee sometime?
"
6,24,16,Robin:,"You know that ""coffee"" is code for ""I want to get back together"" right?
"
6,24,17,Ted:,"Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.
"
6,24,18,Zoey:,"I want to get back together.
"
6,24,19,Ted:,"Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.
"
6,24,20,Barney:,"You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?
"
6,24,21,Ted:,"I'm not letting you press the button.
"
6,24,22,Barney:,"I want to press the button!
"
6,24,23,Ted:,"You're not pressing the button! It's my button!
"
6,24,24,Ted from 2030:,"Sadly, that's all you need to know about my summer. Now, around this time, Uncle Marshall was still having a tough time finding a job.
"
6,24,25,Lily:,"He's out printing out a whole new batch of résumés because he misspelled the phrase ""detail-oriented."" And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him.
"
6,24,26,Robin:,"Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?
"
6,24,27,Lily:,"Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, ""Get sick, get a free gallon of soup"".
"
6,24,28,Ted from 2030:,"And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's surprise soup and headed back to work to introduce the new class pet.
"
6,24,29,Lily:,"This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with... (Lily throws up onto Mr. Buttons 2. She leaves the shool, running to her apartment in order to stop Marshall from eating the soup) Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God.
"
6,24,30,Marshall:,"This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?
"
6,24,31,Robin:,"Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?
"
6,24,32,Barney:,"Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!
"
6,24,33,Robin:,"You okay?
"
6,24,34,Ted:,"Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.
"
6,24,35,Foreman:,"Hey, hotshot.
"
6,24,36,Ted:,"You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.
"
6,24,37,Rod:,"Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be 50,000 of these in your big, hotshot building, hotshot.
"
6,24,38,Ted:,"50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?
"
6,24,39,Barney:,"Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?
"
6,24,40,Ted:,"There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?
"
6,24,41,Barney:,"Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better.
"
6,24,42,Ted:,"You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.
"
6,24,43,Barney:,"Ah, but ""new is always better"" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.
"
6,24,44,Ted:,"Hi, Marsh.
"
6,24,45,Barney:,"Oh, hey, buddy.
"
6,24,46,Robin:,"Hey. Everything okay?
"
6,24,47,Marshall:,"Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.
"
6,24,48,Lily:,"Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?
"
6,24,49,Marshall:,"Of course, baby. (He hesitates, then put one finger onto her back)
"
6,24,50,Marshall:,"But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...
"
6,24,51,Marshall:,"Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.
"
6,24,52,Lily:,"Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?
"
6,24,53,Marshall:,"Um, I...
"
6,24,54,Lily:,"Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather,"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.
"
6,24,55,Marshall:,"I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.
"
6,24,56,Barney:,"I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.
"
6,24,57,Robin:,"I bet it's her tushie.
"
6,24,58,Barney:,"I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!
"
6,24,59,"Ted, while texting on his phone:","Yeah, fine, okay.
"
6,24,60,Barney:,"I got you this job, so I... Say what?
"
6,24,61,Ted:,"Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. (Ted leaves the Bar)
"
6,24,62,Barney:,"You...
"
6,24,63,"Marshall, picking up his phone:","Hello?... Yes, it is. (To Lily) It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates. They want me to come interview. (Lily throws up) I know it's risky to go, but this is the best environmental law firm in New York. It's my dream job. (Lily throws up) That's a great idea, babe. I'll ask them. (In his phone) Hey, is it at all possible, could I come in on Monday?... Okay, I'll, I'll see you at 5:00. (Marshall hangs up) Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby.
"
6,24,64,Robin:,"Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. ""See you in an hour.""
"
6,24,65,Barney:,"Who's that from?
"
6,24,66,Robin:,"Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!
"
6,24,67,Barney:,"Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.
"
6,24,68,Robin:,"After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.
"
6,24,69,Barney:,"No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.
"
6,24,70,Robin:,"Uh, Ted's gone back for less.
"
6,24,71,Ted:,"Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?
"
6,24,72,Ted:,"Bro.
"
6,24,73,Barney:,"Ted, I only have one rule.
"
6,24,74,Ted:,"But I can't reach the worst part. (He picks his phone and calls someone) Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?
"
6,24,75,announcer:,"Coming up next, our two local pandas, Ming Ming and Bao Bao, are expecting a baby.
"
6,24,76,Ted:,"Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?
"
6,24,77,Robin:,"Get it together, bro.
"
6,24,78,Marshall:,"According to my calculations, at 6:00 p.m., my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time.
"
6,24,79,Lily:,"Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?
"
6,24,80,Marshall:,"Don't worry. I'll be prepared.
"
6,24,81,Neighbor:,"I'm talking your ear off, sorry. Is there anything I can do for you, sweetie?
"
6,24,82,Marshall:,"Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?
"
6,24,83,Barney:,"We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?
"
6,24,84,Robin:,"Okay, Zoey wrote, ""Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.""
"
6,24,85,Barney:,"Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.
"
6,24,86,Ted:,"Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... (The rest is unintelligible)
"
6,24,87,Robin:,"Aw, that's sweet.
"
6,24,88,Barney:,"You weren't listening either?
"
6,24,89,Robin:,"I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?
"
6,24,90,Barney and Robin:,"Lily!
"
6,24,91,Lily:,"Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.
"
6,24,92,Robin:,"Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.
"
6,24,93,Lily:,"Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.
"
6,24,94,Ted's voice:,"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us you're exploding from both ends like a busted fire hydrant.
"
6,24,95,Lily:,"Damn it, Marshall.
"
6,24,96,Ted's voice:,"Anyway, listen, I was going to get back together with Zoey today, but I came to my senses on the way out here, so... False alarm... Oh, crap. Just stepped in some gum. I'm getting back together with Zoey!
"
6,24,97,Robin:,"Okay, we're never gonna find him.
"
6,24,98,Lily:,"Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor.
"
6,24,99,voice:,"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us...
"
6,24,100,Lily:,"Got it. Ted's at... (Lily runs to the bathroom and throws up) Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.
"
6,24,101,Barney:,"That's the intersection.
"
6,24,102,Robin:,"That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?
"
6,24,103,Barney:,"Way ahead of ya.
"
6,24,104,Ranjit:,"Hello!
"
6,24,105,Man:,"Marshall. Jake Bloom. Great to meet you.
"
6,24,106,Marshall:,"Hello, hi.
"
6,24,107,Jake:,"Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train.
"
6,24,108,Robin:,"I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.
"
6,24,109,Barney:,"I know. They're a total train wreck.
"
6,24,110,Robin:,"Unmitigated disaster.
"
6,24,111,Ranjit:,"Worst couple ever.
"
6,24,112,Barney:,"Yeah, almost as bad as us.
"
6,24,113,Robin:,"We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.
"
6,24,114,Barney:,"What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.
"
6,24,115,Robin:,"You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.
"
6,24,116,Barney:,"Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?
"
6,24,117,Robin:,"I guess I get it.
"
6,24,118,Barney:,"What do you mean?
"
6,24,119,Robin:,"Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?
"
6,24,120,Barney:,"Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?
"
6,24,121,Robin:,"Yeah, she did.
"
6,24,122,Ranjit:,"Smith and Ninth Street.
"
6,24,123,Jake:,"So, let me show you some of the gut-wrenching environmental atrocities that we were working to stop, okay? Here, pop quiz. What is that?
"
6,24,124,Marshall:,"That's a seal.
"
6,24,125,Jake:,"Bingo! Yes, a bloated seal corpse rotting in industrial waste.
"
6,24,126,Marshall:,"Mm-hmm.
"
6,24,127,Jake:,"Now, wait till you see what we found when we cut him open.
"
6,24,128,Robin:,"Okay, where the hell are they?
"
6,24,129,Barney:,"Maybe this isn't the intersection.
"
6,24,130,Robin:,"Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.
"
6,24,131,Man:,"I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so... whatever.
"
6,24,132,Robin:,"Wait. Where'd you get that? (The guy is holding a cup, on which is printed ""The Intersection"")
"
6,24,133,Man:,"Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?
"
6,24,134,Barney:,"She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?
"
6,24,135,Robin:,"Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?
"
6,24,136,Barney:,"Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.
"
6,24,137,"Ted, leaving the florist's shop:","Thanks, Julia! You know what? Let me see the pink lady slipper again. (He goes back inside)
"
6,24,138,Jake:,"Now, do you know what that is?
"
6,24,139,Marshall:,"A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge.
"
6,24,140,Jake:,"Being eaten by rats. Exactly. Now this next slide... Oh, I'm sorry. That's my wife's water birth. I don't know how that got in there. Anyway, that's all my questions.
"
6,24,141,"Marshall, thinking:","Oh, my God, I made it! Now just shake his hand, clench your very soul and run like hell!
"
6,24,142,Jake:,"Now, I like to set aside 20 minutes at the end of every interview for your questions. So don't hold back. Whatever you got inside there, you just let 'er rip.
"
6,24,143,"Marshall, thinking:","I can't do this anymore. I'm just gonna tell him the truth.
"
6,24,144,Lily:,"When it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.
"
6,24,145,Marshall:,"I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends! (Marshall leaves in a hurry)
"
6,24,146,Lily:,"Nailed it.
"
6,24,147,Ted:,"Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. (Barney and Robin jumps on him, all three fall down)Ooh! Come on. What the hell?!
"
6,24,148,Robin:,"You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb.
"
6,24,149,Ted:,"I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!
"
6,24,150,Robin:,"Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.
"
6,24,151,Barney:,"But... it's a mistake.
"
6,24,152,Ted:,"You're right. (Ted stops an elderly woman who was about to enter the Intersection) Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough. (The elderly woman enters and gives theflowers to a blonde sitting alone, but not the right one) No. Hi.
"
6,24,153,Ted from 2030:,"And kids... that's how I met your mother. Psych. It was just some chick.
"
6,24,154,Lily:,"Hey, baby, how'd it go?
"
6,24,155,Marshall:,"Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job. The good news is, in a few seconds, I'm gonna start heaving my guts out because that's what life is for me now: just losing what's inside until I'm just empty.
"
6,24,156,Lily:,"Baby, come here.
"
6,24,157,Marshall:,"I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. (He lyes down onto the bed and falls asleep)
"
6,24,158,Ted from 2030:,"And Marshall slept...all night.
"
6,24,159,Rod:,"Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors?
"
6,24,160,Barney:,"He is.
"
6,24,161,Ted:,"You sure?
"
6,24,162,Barney:,"Yeah. You earned it.
"
6,24,163,Rod:,"All clear!
"
6,24,164,Ted:,"Hey, new is always better, right?
"
6,24,165,Barney:,"Always.
"
6,24,166,Rod:,"Ten, nine, eight...
"
6,24,167,Marshall:,"Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick.
"
6,24,168,Lily:,"I know, baby. I'm pregnant.
"
6,24,169,Rod:,"..one!
"
6,24,170,Robin:,"I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.
"
6,24,171,Barney:,"It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please? (Barney sees Norah, Robin says something to him that we can""t hear, then Barney walks up to Norah) Norah.
"
6,24,172,Norah:,"Hi.
"
6,24,173,Barney:,"How you been?
"
6,24,174,Norah:,"Fine.
"
6,24,175,Barney:,"Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.
"
6,24,176,Norah:,"I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.
"
6,24,177,Barney:,"I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.
"
6,24,178,Norah:,"It's never too late, Barney.
"
6,24,179,Barney:,"Challenge accepted.
"
6,24,180,Lily:,"Best man? You're being summoned.
"
6,24,181,Ted:,"Geez, what now? (He goes inside, enters a room) I heard the groom needed me.
"
6,24,182,Barney:,"What do you think of this tie?
"
6,18,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout.
"
6,18,2,Barney:,"I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.
"
6,18,3,Ted:,"Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.
"
6,18,4,Robin:," Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.
"
6,18,5,Lily:,"Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?
"
6,18,6,Ted:,"No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.
"
6,18,7,Robin:," You wouldn't have to take care of it.
"
6,18,8,Ted:,"Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?
"
6,18,9,Robin:," Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.
"
6,18,10,Marshall:,"Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.
"
6,18,11,Robin:," Here we go.
"
6,18,12,Marshall:,"You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.
"
6,18,13,Barney:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. ""With""? I am not ""with"" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.
"
6,18,14,Robin:," I don't know. This will be your second date.
"
6,18,15,Lily:,"Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.
"
6,18,16,Barney:,"Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...
"
6,18,17,Ted from 2030:,"Barney said this a lot.
"
6,18,18,Barney:,"If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]
"
6,18,19,Barney:,"Never go out with the same girl more than once.
"
6,18,20,Lily:,"Then why are you going out with Nora again?
"
6,18,21,Barney:,"There is an exception.
"
6,18,22,Ted from 2030:,"And it was always the same exception.
"
6,18,23,Barney:,"..unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.
"
6,18,24,Barney:,"And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. (He sneezes)
"
6,18,25,Barney:,"Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.
"
6,18,26,Nora:,"Oh, no. How long have you been sick?
"
6,18,27,Barney:,"About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.
"
6,18,28,Nora:,"Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...
"
6,18,29,Barney:,"Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?
"
6,18,30,Nora:,"Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.
"
6,18,31,Barney:,"The bed... that's where all the...happens.
"
6,18,32,Nora:,"Come on, let's get you sorted out.
"
6,18,33,Ted from 2030:,"That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.
"
6,18,34,Barney:,"Ah. Thank you.
"
6,18,35,Nora:,"Good night, Barney.
"
6,18,36,Barney:,"Good night, Mommy.
"
6,18,37,Lily:,"Wow, she nursed you back to health?
"
6,18,38,Barney:,"No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.
"
6,18,39,Robin:," Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.
"
6,18,40,Nate:,"What's up. guys? Nate Scooberman. But everyone calls me Scooby. I'd love to hang out, but I really gotta hit the john.
"
6,18,41,Ted:,"Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.
"
6,18,42,Nate:,"Thanks, brah. I like you guys.
"
6,18,43,Marshall:,"Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.
"
6,18,44,Robin:," What? You told me to meet someone.
"
6,18,45,Marshall:,"I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.
"
6,18,46,Robin:," Actually, I met him in the park.
"
6,18,47,Ted:,"Should have just let you get a dog.
"
6,18,48,Barney:,"Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.
"
6,18,49,Lily:,"Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?
"
6,18,50,Barney:,"No.
"
6,18,51,Lily:,"Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?
"
6,18,52,Barney:,"Yes!
"
6,18,53,Lily:,"Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.
"
6,18,54,Barney:,"Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *
"
6,18,55,Barney:,"* Bang, bang, bangity bang... *
"
6,18,56,The cardiologist:,"Are we done?
"
6,18,57,Barney:,"* A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *
"
6,18,58,The cardiologist:,"Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.
"
6,18,59,Barney:,"See, Lily? She was worried.
"
6,18,60,The cardiologist:,"Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia.
"
6,18,61,Lily:,"Ow! Nails, nails!
"
6,18,62,The cardiologist:,"It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.
"
6,18,63,Barney:,"Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.
"
6,18,64,The cardiologist:,"Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.
"
6,18,65,Barney:,"Well, now it doesn't.
"
6,18,66,Ted from 2030:,"And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.
"
6,18,67,The cardiologist:,"Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.
"
6,18,68,Barney:,"Go on, Doctor.
"
6,18,69,The cardiologist:,"What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?
"
6,18,70,Barney:,"Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.
"
6,18,71,Nora:,"This might be a little forward, but do you have a bomb strapped to your chest?
"
6,18,72,Barney:,"This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.
"
6,18,73,Nora:,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.
"
6,18,74,Barney:,"What's that like?
"
6,18,75,Nora:,"So is everything okay?
"
6,18,76,Barney:,"My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.
"
6,18,77,Nora:,"Oh, I am so sorry.
"
6,18,78,Barney:,"Thanks.
"
6,18,79,Nora:,"Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.
"
6,18,80,Barney:,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?
"
6,18,81,Nora:,"I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that.
"
6,18,82,Lily:,"You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!
"
6,18,83,Barney:,"That's exactly what I want, too.
"
6,18,84,Nate:,"I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, ""get out of here!"" And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, ""get out of here!"" So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back.
"
6,18,85,Robin:," Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.
"
6,18,86,Marshall:,"Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.
"
6,18,87,Robin:," And what is he?
"
6,18,88,Marshall:,"He's a dog.
"
6,18,89,Ted:,"He's totally a dog.
"
6,18,90,Robin:," What? You saw him hitting on someone?
"
6,18,91,Marshall:,"No, I didn't say, ""He a dawg."" I said, ""He's a dog."" As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.
"
6,18,92,Ted:,"Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.
"
6,18,93,Nate:,"Where?
"
6,18,94,Marshall:,"Okay, Scooby, you ready?
"
6,18,95,Ted:,"Good boy!
"
6,18,96,Robin:," That last one did not happen.
"
6,18,97,Marshall:,"Okay, you're right. He dropped it.
"
6,18,98,Robin:," He's not a dog.
"
6,18,99,Ted:,"Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.
"
6,18,100,Nate:,"Hey, guys, got my shots.
"
6,18,101,Marshall:,"You are so playful.
"
6,18,102,Ted:,"Nice job fetching those.
"
6,18,103,Lily:,"Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.
"
6,18,104,Marshall:,"So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.
"
6,18,105,Ted:,"Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you ""paws.""
"
6,18,106,Lily:,"How did you meet?
"
6,18,107,Marshall:,"Tell us the ""tail""
"
6,18,108,Ted:,"es, how did you ""whisker"" off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.
"
6,18,109,Lily:,"Did you send her an e-mail, or did you ""collar""?
"
6,18,110,Robin:," Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.
"
6,18,111,Marshall:,"No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to ""flea.""
"
6,18,112,Lily:,"We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel.
"
6,18,113,Ted:,"So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ""ruff.""
"
6,18,114,Nate:,"Sure was. My part of Canada's pretty different from New York.
"
6,18,115,Lily:,"Oh, I bet it was an ""Incredible Journey""""
"
6,18,116,Marshall:,"What part of Canada is that? Speak.
"
6,18,117,Nate:,"Labrador.
"
6,18,118,Lily:,"This isn't happening.
"
6,18,119,Robin:," Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox.
"
6,18,120,Nate:,"No, I'm good.
"
6,18,121,Robin:," Oh, shoot, dropped my keys.
"
6,18,122,Nate:,"I'll get 'em.
"
6,18,123,Barney:,"Hey, guys, this is Nora.
"
6,18,124,Nora:,"We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman.
"
6,18,125,Robin:," Well, it's still early.
"
6,18,126,Nora:,"I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic.
"
6,18,127,Lily:,"I had no idea he had a deep down.
"
6,18,128,Nora:,"Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.
"
6,18,129,Barney:,"I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.
"
6,18,130,Nora:,"How many do you want?
"
6,18,131,Barney:,"Three... one of each. You?
"
6,18,132,Nora:,"Three. All in an old stone house.
"
6,18,133,Barney:,"Yeah, with ivy growing on it.
"
6,18,134,Barney:,"And we must have a pool.
"
6,18,135,Nora:,"We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?
"
6,18,136,Barney:,"I really am.
"
6,18,137,Robin:,"Unbelievable.
"
6,18,138,Nora:,"I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.
"
6,18,139,Barney:,"I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...
"
6,18,140,The cardiologist:,"And that explains your 14-second cardiac arrest.
"
6,18,141,Lily:,"Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.
"
6,18,142,Barney:,"I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.
"
6,18,143,Lily:,"I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle.
"
6,18,144,Marshall:,"Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.
"
6,18,145,Barney:,"Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.
"
6,18,146,Lily:,"Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.
"
6,18,147,Barney:,"Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?
"
6,18,148,Lily:,"Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.
"
6,18,149,Barney:,"Marshall?
"
6,18,150,Marshall:,"You got nothing on me.
"
6,18,151,Barney:,"The calzone?
"
6,18,152,Marshall:,"Checkmate.
"
6,18,153,Barney:,"Robin.
"
6,18,154,Robin:," Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...
"
6,18,155,Barney:,"The Mr. T dream...
"
6,18,156,Robin:,"I'm lost.
"
6,18,157,Barney:,"Ted?
"
6,18,158,Ted:,"Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.
"
6,18,159,Barney:,"The ballet class.
"
6,18,160,Ted:,"I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.
"
6,18,161,Barney:,"The 'N Sync concert.
"
6,18,162,Ted:,"1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?
"
6,18,163,Barney:,"Okay, Ted. The thermos.
"
6,18,164,Ted:,"I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.
"
6,18,165,Barney:,"I do! So be cool!
"
6,18,166,Nora:,"There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.
"
6,18,167,Robin:," Sorry, toots. He's taken.
"
6,18,168,Nora:,"So. How do you all know Barney?
"
6,18,169,Lily:,"Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me.
"
6,18,170,Marshall:,"We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because... Barney don't go to no strip clubs.
"
6,18,171,Nora:,"Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once.
"
6,18,172,Ted:,"Once?
"
6,18,173,Barney:,"Thermos.
"
6,18,174,Ted:,"Nope. Not even once.
"
6,18,175,Nora:,"Really? So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy.
"
6,18,176,Lily:,"I don't recall.
"
6,18,177,Marshall:,"Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?
"
6,18,178,Nora:,"It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?
"
6,18,179,Ted from 2030:,"This was a big deal for Barney.
"
6,18,180,Barney:,"I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.
"
6,18,181,Ted:,"Not even if she's hot?
"
6,18,182,Barney:,"Not even if her mom's hot.
"
6,18,183,Barney:,"I'd love to meet your parents.
"
6,18,184,Nora:,"It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home?
"
6,18,185,Nate:,"Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.
"
6,18,186,Barney:,"No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!
"
6,18,187,Robin:," Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.
"
6,18,188,Ted:,"I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.
"
6,18,189,Robin:," He's not a... Good night.
"
6,18,190,Nate:,"What do we do now? Oh! I got an idea. I was in the park today, and this guy sold me a big bag of...
"
6,18,191,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, it was a big bag of sandwiches.
"
6,18,192,Marshall:,"Whoa. Put that away.
"
6,18,193,Nate:,"You guys want to fire these up?
"
6,18,194,Lily:,"Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.
"
6,18,195,Ted:,"Sandwich brownies?
"
6,18,196,Nate:,"Okay.
"
6,18,197,Marshall:,"Sandwiches make me hungry.
"
6,18,198,Ted:,"Truth. Hey. I have a question.
"
6,18,199,Marshall:,"Yeah?
"
6,18,200,Ted:,"What did Barney mean when he said ""calzone""?
"
6,18,201,Marshall:,"Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...
"
6,18,202,Ted:,"Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.
"
6,18,203,Lily:,"Guys, I found this on the floor.
"
6,18,204,Ted:,"Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?
"
6,18,205,Lily:,"Scooby got out!
"
6,18,206,Nora:,"Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.
"
6,18,207,Barney:,"Yeah, me, too.
"
6,18,208,Nora:,"Do you want to come upstairs?
"
6,18,209,Barney:,"I'd love to. (He kisses her) There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.
"
6,18,210,Barney:,"Can you believe...
"
6,18,211,Lily:,"Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.
"
6,18,212,Marshall:,"Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.
"
6,18,213,"Ted, on the phone with Robin:","obin! Hey. Hey, um, remember Scooby? Uh, well, he got out.
"
6,18,214,Robin:," ""Got out""? What do you mean?
"
6,18,215,Ted:,"He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.
"
6,18,216,Marshall:,"It wasn't me.
"
6,18,217,Lily:,"Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.
"
6,18,218,Ted:,"He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.
"
6,18,219,Marshall:,"I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.
"
6,18,220,Robin:," Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.
"
6,18,221,Ted:,"Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?
"
6,18,222,Barney:,"Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.
"
6,18,223,Nora:,"Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!
"
6,18,224,Barney:,"I was on the spot. This is your fault.
"
6,18,225,Nora:,"My fault?
"
6,18,226,Barney:,"Yeah, with the whole ""I want to get married"" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.
"
6,18,227,Nora:,"Good-bye, Barney.
"
6,18,228,Ted:,"Great idea.
"
6,18,229,Marshall:,"No, great idea!
"
6,18,230,Lily:,"Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?
"
6,18,231,Marshall:,"Of course. Back to the pizza place!
"
6,18,232,Ted:,"Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.
"
6,18,233,Marshall:,"Who's Scooby?
"
6,18,234,Robin:," Hey, have you seen Scooby?
"
6,18,235,Barney:,"Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?
"
6,18,236,Marshall:,"Scooby!
"
6,18,237,Nate:,"Oh, hey! It's my friends!
"
6,18,238,The cardiologist:,"And that explains 12:51 a.m. Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue. Your heart's fine. With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life. If nobody stabs you.
"
6,18,239,Lily:,"Day's not over.
"
6,18,240,Barney:,"Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.
"
6,18,241,Lily:,"No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.
"
6,18,242,Barney:,"Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...
"
6,18,243,Lily:,"What time was your dinner reservation?
"
6,18,244,Barney:,"Last night? 8:30.
"
6,18,245,The cardiologist:,"What did his heart do at 8:30? It... literally skipped a beat.
"
6,18,246,Lily:,"Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.
"
6,18,247,Barney:,"I lied.
"
6,18,248,Nora:,"Barney.
"
6,18,249,Barney:,"When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.
"
6,18,250,Nora:,"I'm confused.
"
6,18,251,Barney:,"So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.
"
6,18,252,Nora:,"Mom, Dad... this is Barney.
"
6,18,253,Barney:,"Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
"
6,15,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to stay home a while to take care of his mother. (phone ringing) But the longer he stayed there, the more it was like he had never left Minnesota.
"
6,15,2,Marshall:,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.
"
6,15,3,"Robin, laughing:","Oh, that is too cute. Say it again.
"
6,15,4,Marshall:,"No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something.
"
6,15,5,Robin:,"There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.
"
6,15,6,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, remember. Zoey had tried to save an old building from being torn down and replaced by a new building that I'd been hired to design. And yet somehow, despite this, we had all managed to become friends. Which brings us to the night Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner.
"
6,15,7,Robin:,"I thought the oven was Celsius.
"
6,15,8,Ted:,"It's okay. We got hot dogs.
"
6,15,9,Lily:,"Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.
"
6,15,10,Zoey:,"Could someone pass the ketchup?
"
6,15,11,Barney:,"I hope I can pass this hot dog.
"
6,15,12,Zoey:,"Oh.Oops.
"
6,15,13,Ted:,"Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup.
"
6,15,14,Zoey:,"Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine.
"
6,15,15,Ted:,"Which is all gone.
"
6,15,16,Zoey:,"All right, I tell you what... you get this one bottle, I'll get the next three.
"
6,15,17,Ted:,"Hmm, tell you what... no dice.
"
6,15,18,Zoey:,"I'll get the next hundred.
"
6,15,19,Ted:,"You're not getting out of this.
"
6,15,20,Zoey:,"You want to go on a date with my hot cousin?
"
6,15,21,Ted:,"I'll get the ketchup.
"
6,15,22,Marshall:,"Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good.
"
6,15,23,Robin:,"Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.
"
6,15,24,Robin:,"Finally, Ted called her up.
"
6,15,25,Zoey:,"Hello.
"
6,15,26,Ted:,"So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.
"
6,15,27,Zoey:,"You still want to do that?
"
6,15,28,Ted:,"Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.
"
6,15,29,Zoey:,"Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.
"
6,15,30,"Barney, coughing:","""Cute"" means ""fat""""
"
6,15,31,Zoey:,"She's not fat.
"
6,15,32,"Barney, coughing:","""Not fat"" means ""ugly""""
"
6,15,33,Zoey:,"Oh, here she is.
"
6,15,34,"Barney, coughing:","I take back everything I said. That girl is extremely attractive.
"
6,15,35,Honey:,"Hey, Zoey.
"
6,15,36,Zoey:,"Hey. Ted, this is my cousin...
"
6,15,37,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, to be honest, I don't quite remember this girl's name. None of us do, because as this story has been told and retold, we've always just referred to her as...
"
6,15,38,Honey:,"Honey.
"
6,15,39,Ted:,"Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.
"
6,15,40,Ted from 2030:,"And here's why...
"
6,15,41,Robin:,"She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, ""Oh, honey.""
"
6,15,42,Marshall:,"Interesting. Show your work.
"
6,15,43,Honey:,"My apartment building is so safe. My landlord... he even installed a security camera in my shower.
"
6,15,44,Marshall:,"Oh, honey.
"
6,15,45,Honey:,"Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince.
"
6,15,46,Marshall:,"Oh, honey.
"
6,15,47,Honey:,"I just had a great TV audition. Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends.
"
6,15,48,Marshall:,"Oh, honey.
"
6,15,49,Honey:,"Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.
"
6,15,50,Marshall:,"Oh, honey.
"
6,15,51,Robin:,"I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom...
"
6,15,52,Honey:,"Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself.
"
6,15,53,Barney:,"Oh, honey.
"
6,15,54,Robin:,"So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.
"
6,15,55,Honey:,"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.
"
6,15,56,Barney:,"Why do they call 'em coasters?
"
6,15,57,Robin:,"And Barney.
"
6,15,58,Honey:,"Okay, time to go home.
"
6,15,59,Barney:,"Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?
"
6,15,60,Ted:,"What are you talking about?
"
6,15,61,Barney:,"Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.
"
6,15,62,Ted:,"What?
"
6,15,63,Barney:,"It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?
"
6,15,64,Ted:,"Mm-hmm.
"
6,15,65,Barney:,"Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man.
"
6,15,66,Ted:,"You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.
"
6,15,67,Robin:,"Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.
"
6,15,68,Ted:,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.
"
6,15,69,Robin:,"Hmm?
"
6,15,70,Judy:,"He's gay!
"
6,15,71,Marshall:,"Mom, hang up!
"
6,15,72,Judy:,"I'm sorry.
"
6,15,73,Marshall:,"Go on.
"
6,15,74,Ted:,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.
"
6,15,75,Robin:,"Hmm?
"
6,15,76,Ted:,"I'm in love with Zoey.
"
6,15,77,Marshall:,"Oh, my God.
"
6,15,78,Judy:,"Oh, my God!
"
6,15,79,Marshall:,"Mom!
"
6,15,80,Judy:,"Sorry.
"
6,15,81,Marshall:,"Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention.
"
6,15,82,Robin:,"Funny you should say that.
"
6,15,83,Barney:,"Does anyone know why we're here?
"
6,15,84,Lily:,"Yeah, who called this intervention?
"
6,15,85,Ted:,"I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath.
"
6,15,86,Lily:,"Finally.
"
6,15,87,Robin:,"Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.
"
6,15,88,Barney:,"Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch.
"
6,15,89,Ted:,"It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene.
"
6,15,90,Lily:,"Are you sure it's love?
"
6,15,91,Ted:,"Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and...(glass shatters) I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love.
"
6,15,92,Marshall:,"Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next?
"
6,15,93,Ted:,"This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey.
"
6,15,94,Robin:,"Isn't that a little harsh?
"
6,15,95,Lily:,"Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.
"
6,15,96,Robin:,"Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.
"
6,15,97,Ted:,"Then what am I supposed to do?
"
6,15,98,Robin:,"Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.
"
6,15,99,Ted:,"Fine. I'll shut 'em down.
"
6,15,100,Lily:,"And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.
"
6,15,101,Marshall:,"Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize.
"
6,15,102,Robin:,"So don't answer it.
"
6,15,103,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
6,15,104,"Robin, with a Minnesotan accent:","Oh, my God, you are so Minnesota. You can't not answer the phone because it would be rude.
"
6,15,105,Marshall:,"Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.
"
6,15,106,Barney:,"Hey, Marshall.
"
6,15,107,Marshall:,"Barney. W- What number is this?
"
6,15,108,Barney:,"I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.
"
6,15,109,Marshall:,"Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.
"
6,15,110,Barney:,"Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.
"
6,15,111,Honey:,"Hey, Zoey.
"
6,15,112,Zoey:,"Ted, this is my cousin...
"
6,15,113,Honey:,"Honey.
"
6,15,114,Marshall:,"Uh... Robin's version was...
"
6,15,115,Barney:,"That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.
"
6,15,116,Ted:,"Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
"
6,15,117,Honey:,"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.
"
6,15,118,Ted:,"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah...
"
6,15,119,"Honey, whispering:","Straw.
"
6,15,120,"Barney, whispering:","Coaster.
"
6,15,121,Honey:,"Okay, time to go home.
"
6,15,122,Barney:,"Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.
"
6,15,123,Barney:,"Who's your daddy?
"
6,15,124,Marshall:,"Okay, can we skip this part, please?
"
6,15,125,Barney:,"Sure, I'll just summarize it. (imitating squeaky bedsprings)
"
6,15,126,Marshall:,"Okay, that's been going on a while.
"
6,15,127,Barney:,"Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.
"
6,15,128,Barney:,"Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.
"
6,15,129,Zoey:,"Thanks.
"
6,15,130,Barney:,"Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...
"
6,15,131,Zoey:,"Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?
"
6,15,132,Barney:,"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (imitating squeaky bedsprings)
"
6,15,133,Barney:,"She hugged me. What was that all about?
"
6,15,134,Marcus:,"Zoey's in love with Ted.
"
6,15,135,Marshall:,"Marcus!
"
6,15,136,Marcus:,"Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.
"
6,15,137,Marshall:,"Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.
"
6,15,138,Marcus:,"Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut?
"
6,15,139,Marshall:,"Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah!
"
6,15,140,Marcus:,"Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro.
"
6,15,141,Marshall:,"So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted.
"
6,15,142,Ted:,"Hello.
"
6,15,143,Marshall:,"Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.
"
6,15,144,Ted:,"Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.
"
6,15,145,Zoey:,"Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me.
"
6,15,146,Ted:,"Can I get you a beer?
"
6,15,147,Zoey:,"Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way.
"
6,15,148,"Ted, laughing:","Oh, my God.
"
6,15,149,Zoey:,"What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? What?
"
6,15,150,Ted:,"isten, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...
"
6,15,151,Judy:,"Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything?
"
6,15,152,Marshall:,"Mom! Get off the phone!
"
6,15,153,Marcus:,"Could you get some more Bugles, please?
"
6,15,154,Judy:,"Of course, dear.
"
6,15,155,Marshall:,"Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on.
"
6,15,156,Ted:,"I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.
"
6,15,157,Zoey:,"Wow. Okay.
"
6,15,158,Ted:,"And that was it. No more Zoey.
"
6,15,159,Marshall:,"Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby.
"
6,15,160,Lily:,"We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.
"
6,15,161,Marshall:,"Ted's a son of a bitch! (cell phone chirps) Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.
"
6,15,162,Lily:,"Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story?
"
6,15,163,Ted:,"I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.
"
6,15,164,Zoey:,"Why?
"
6,15,165,Ted:,"Lily hates you.
"
6,15,166,Zoey:,"You hate me?
"
6,15,167,Lily:,"That's crazy. I don't hate you.
"
6,15,168,Zoey:,"Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything.
"
6,15,169,Lily:,"He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly?
"
6,15,170,Ted:,"Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.
"
6,15,171,Lily:,"Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch.
"
6,15,172,Zoey:,"I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff.
"
6,15,173,Marshall:,"Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?
"
6,15,174,Lily:,"I don't know.
"
6,15,175,Marshall:,"Well, you did the right thing, baby.
"
6,15,176,Lily:,"Not entirely.
"
6,15,177,Lily:,"Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you.
"
6,15,178,Marshall:,"And that's Robin on the other line.
"
6,15,179,Lily:,"Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!
"
6,15,180,Marshall:,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...
"
6,15,181,Robin:,"Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.
"
6,15,182,Marshall:,"Me? You dragged me into this?!
"
6,15,183,Robin:,"You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...
"
6,15,184,Marshall:,"Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!
"
6,15,185,Robin:,"Just don't answer it.
"
6,15,186,Marshall:,"I can't not answer. It's impolite.
"
6,15,187,Robin:,"Marshall, you can beat this.
"
6,15,188,Marshall:,"I can't turn my back on politeness.
"
6,15,189,Robin:,"You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.
"
6,15,190,Marshall:,"Good manners are what separate us from those ""elbows on the table"" Wisconsinites.
"
6,15,191,Robin:,"You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!
"
6,15,192,Marshall:,"I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.
"
6,15,193,Honey:,"Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh... I was his first.
"
6,15,194,Marshall:,"Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.
"
6,15,195,Honey:,"Hi.
"
6,15,196,Marshall:,"Listen, um, about Barney...
"
6,15,197,Honey:,"Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.
"
6,15,198,Barney:,"Who's your daddy?
"
6,15,199,"Honey, giggling:","Oh... Who's your daddy?
"
6,15,200,"Barney, sobbing:","I don't know.
"
6,15,201,Honey:,"I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.
"
6,15,202,Barney:,"So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.
"
6,15,203,Honey:,"Oh, honey.
"
6,15,204,Barney:,"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.
"
6,15,205,Honey:,"Oh, honey.
"
6,15,206,Barney:,"I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.
"
6,15,207,Honey:,"Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.
"
6,15,208,Barney:,"Four. Four Nobel Prizes.
"
6,15,209,Honey:,"Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?
"
6,15,210,Barney:,"Only three.
"
6,15,211,Honey:,"Well, there you go.
"
6,15,212,Marshall:,"Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?
"
6,15,213,Honey:,"Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.
"
6,15,214,Marshall:,"I am her therapist.
"
6,15,215,Honey:,"Oh! Well, in that case...
"
6,15,216,Marshall:,"Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!
"
6,15,217,Zoey:,"What's this really about?
"
6,15,218,Ted:,"I told you. Lily hates you.
"
6,15,219,Zoey:,"I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it.
"
6,15,220,Ted:,"All right. Yes. I... hate you.
"
6,15,221,Zoey:,"Great. See? Was that so hard?
"
6,15,222,Ted:,"Zoey.
"
6,15,223,Zoey:,"Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why.
"
6,15,224,Marshall:,"So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?
"
6,15,225,Marcus:,"Zoey's in love with...
"
6,15,226,Marshall:,"Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...
"
6,15,227,Ted:,"And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.
"
6,15,228,Zoey:,"Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it.
"
6,15,229,Marshall:,"Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?
"
6,15,230,Marcus:,"So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.
"
6,15,231,Marshall:,"Give me that phone.
"
6,15,232,Ted:,"Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? (cell phone ringing) Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.
"
6,15,233,Zoey:,"Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall...Yes, I am...Yes, I am...He is?...Bye.
"
6,15,234,Ted:,"Why was Marshall calling?
"
6,15,235,Zoey:,"Don't worry about it. Go on.
"
6,15,236,Ted:,"You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.
"
6,15,237,Zoey:,"Well, actually... (speaking Portuguese)
"
6,15,238,Ted:,"You're a show-off.
"
6,15,239,Zoey:,"You better take that.
"
6,15,240,Ted:,"Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go.
"
6,15,241,Neighbour:,"They're kissing.
"
6,15,242,Marshall:,"They're kissing?! Yeah! (screams) They're kissing!
"
6,1,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, there are two big days in any love story: the day you meet the girl of your dreams, and the day you marry her.
"
6,1,2,Ted:,"Nice! Where'd you get this?
"
6,1,3,Marshall:,"Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you.
"
6,1,4,Ted:,"And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church.
"
6,1,5,Marshall:,"Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous?
"
6,1,6,Ted:,"What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous?
"
6,1,7,Marshall:,"Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous.
"
6,1,8,Ted:,"Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers.
"
6,1,9,Barney:,"I'm sorry. I'll let you work. But first, a riddle: What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire?
"
6,1,10,Ted:,"A sun dress.
"
6,1,11,Barney:,"Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?
"
6,1,12,Ted:,"I really have to get this done.
"
6,1,13,Barney:,"Of course, of course.
"
6,1,14,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
6,1,15,Barney:,"""Sun dress,"" by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock...
"
6,1,16,Ted:,"Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!
"
6,1,17,Barney:,"I want to see a pretty girl.
"
6,1,18,Ted:,"Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.
"
6,1,19,Barney:,"I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word.
"
6,1,20,Ted:,"And what's that word?
"
6,1,21,Barney:,"Dibs!
"
6,1,22,Ted:,"What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.
"
6,1,23,Barney:,"You never called dibs.
"
6,1,24,Ted:,"Dibs were implied.
"
6,1,25,Barney:,"Implied dibs?
"
6,1,26,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
6,1,27,Barney:,"Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...
"
6,1,28,Ted:,"Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.
"
6,1,29,Barney:,"And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!
"
6,1,30,Ted:,"Damn it!
"
6,1,31,Barney:,"Where is Marshall anyway?
"
6,1,32,Ted from 2030:,"Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family. Tonight was their first at-bat.
"
6,1,33,Marshall:,"Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles?
"
6,1,34,Lily:,"Check.
"
6,1,35,Marshall:,"Music to set the mood?
"
6,1,36,Lily:,"Check.
"
6,1,37,Marshall:,"Music for when we're actually doing it?
"
6,1,38,Lily:,"Check.
"
6,1,39,Ted:,"You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.
"
6,1,40,Barney:,"Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. Just know this: When I step up to make my toast as your best man...
"
6,1,41,Ted:,"Actually, Marshall would probably be...
"
6,1,42,Barney:,"As your best man...
"
6,1,43,Barney:,"Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs.
"
6,1,44,Ted:,"No!
"
6,1,45,Barney:,"What?
"
6,1,46,Ted's wife:,"Tell me this isn't true.
"
6,1,47,Ted:,"I had implied dibs.
"
6,1,48,Ted's wife:,"(she slaps him in the face) You know, you've humiliated me! (turning towards Barney) I had no idea. You have to know that.
"
6,1,49,Barney:,"Shhh, shh. You're the victim here. We both are. Let's get out of here.
"
6,1,50,Ted's wife:,"Or, you know, we could just do it right here.
"
6,1,51,Barney:,"We could just do it right here.
"
6,1,52,Ted:,"Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.
"
6,1,53,Barney:,"Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, ""Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny."" That is not what ""shields up"" looks like. (He points to Robin who is entering the bar, with greasy hair and dirty clothes) That is what ""shields up"" looks like.
"
6,1,54,Robin:,"Move. God! (She come over Ted and Barney's table) Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?
"
6,1,55,Barney:,"Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace.
"
6,1,56,Robin:,"No fries for this guy.
"
6,1,57,Barney:,"Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.
"
6,1,58,Ted:,"You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.
"
6,1,59,Barney:,"With hygiene?
"
6,1,60,Ted from 2030:,"No, with Don. A few months earlier...
"
6,1,61,Ted:,"Here, have some tea.
"
6,1,62,Robin:,"Thanks.
"
6,1,63,Ted:,"Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need.
"
6,1,64,Robin:,"Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no.
"
6,1,65,Ted:,"Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.
"
6,1,66,Robin:,"Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle: careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out.
"
6,1,67,Robin:,"Okay, I'm ready to have s*x now.
"
6,1,68,Ted:,"It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto?
"
6,1,69,Robin:,"No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.
"
6,1,70,Barney:,"Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you.
"
6,1,71,Ted:,"Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?
"
6,1,72,Robin:,"Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? (She gets a giant hamburger out of a paper bag)
"
6,1,73,Barney:,"This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a ""de-rection.""
"
6,1,74,Ted:,"Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?
"
6,1,75,Marshall:,"Nope!
"
6,1,76,Lily:,"Okay, so, here's what happened. I was at home, waiting for Marshall.
"
6,1,77,Marshall:,"Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall!
"
6,1,78,Lily:,"Marshall, whoa! Wait. A big package just arrived.
"
6,1,79,Marshall:,"Yeah, it did.
"
6,1,80,Lily:,"No, no. It's a real package from your dad.
"
6,1,81,Marshall:,"Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is.
"
6,1,82,Lily:,"Marshall, look!
"
6,1,83,Marshall:,"A bassinet? Oh, my... He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily?
"
6,1,84,Lily:,"You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?
"
6,1,85,Marshall:,"Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.
"
6,1,86,Ted & Barney:,"Ohhh
"
6,1,87,Marshall:,"We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you.
"
6,1,88,Lily:,"I have read 11 books on conception. I have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar. I take my temperature every hour. But good for you for not playing with yourself.
"
6,1,89,Ted:,"I feel you, buddy.
"
6,1,90,Marshall:,"Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously. (He looks at Robin, picking her teeth) Okay, I'm better now.
"
6,1,91,Ted:,"Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?
"
6,1,92,Barney:,"Excuse me?
"
6,1,93,Ted:,"Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.
"
6,1,94,Barney:,"Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.
"
6,1,95,Ted:,"20 bucks.
"
6,1,96,Barney:,"But I... Can I go smell her first?
"
6,1,97,Ted:,"No. (He takes $20 out of his wallet)
"
6,1,98,Barney:,"Fine. (He takes the money)
"
6,1,99,Ted:,"All right. Wish me luck.
"
6,1,100,Ted from 2030:,"Now kids, remember how I told you about a girl named Cindy? [FLASHBACK - Cindy's appartment] How I went on one date with her and it ended...
"
6,1,101,Cindy:,"Get out.
"
6,1,102,Ted from 2030:,"badly? Well... [END OF FLASHACK]
"
6,1,103,The Girl who was reading:,"How are you? (to cindy)
"
6,1,104,Cindy:,"Good.
"
6,1,105,Barney:,"What the hell are you doing?
"
6,1,106,Ted:,"That girl she's talking to? I dated her.
"
6,1,107,Barney:,"Oh, that sucks! And dibs.
"
6,1,108,Robin:,"So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?
"
6,1,109,Robin:,"Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?
"
6,1,110,Ted from 2030:,"Then I remembered. Cindy had a roommate. A roommate I only caught a glimpse of... But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special. Was it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle?
"
6,1,111,Ted:,"I got to see her ankles.
"
6,1,112,Robin:,"You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...
"
6,1,113,Marshall:,"Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo?
"
6,1,114,Lily:,"Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office?
"
6,1,115,Marshall:,"Shannon? Start the music...
"
6,1,116,Marshall:,"I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.
"
6,1,117,Lily:,"Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings...
"
6,1,118,Lily:,"Hello.
"
6,1,119,Marshall's dad:,"Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I noticed you hadn't changed your last name yet.
"
6,1,120,Lilly:,"No, I'm gonna...
"
6,1,121,Marshall's dad:,"So, don't worry. I called the DMV, I called your Amex, I got that process started for you.
"
6,1,122,Lily:,"Hello.
"
6,1,123,Marshall's dad:,"Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I understand you and Marshall have been fighting. Well, let me tell you what works for me and the missus. Frilly French undies and a box of wine.
"
6,1,124,Lily:,"Hello.
"
6,1,125,Marshall's dad:,"You might want to try pickles on that sandwich.
"
6,1,126,Marshall:,"Pickles would have helped that sandwich!
"
6,1,127,Lily:,"The man has no boundaries. And I just can't procreate under these conditions!
"
6,1,128,Marshall:,"Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done.
"
6,1,129,Lily:,"So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.
"
6,1,130,Marshall:,"Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke?
"
6,1,131,Lily:,"Only if you want to give this a stroke.
"
6,1,132,Marshall:,"That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think!
"
6,1,133,Robin:,"They're talking to a guy now.
"
6,1,134,Ted:,"What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy?
"
6,1,135,Robin:,"Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.
"
6,1,136,Ted:,"Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.
"
6,1,137,Robin:,"Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?
"
6,1,138,Barney:,"Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.
"
6,1,139,Robin:,"Jealous?
"
6,1,140,Barney:,"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.
"
6,1,141,Robin:,"I have not lost it.
"
6,1,142,Barney:,"You lost it.
"
6,1,143,Robin:,"I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.
"
6,1,144,Barney:,"Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.
"
6,1,145,Robin:,"I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.
"
6,1,146,Marshall:,"Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?
"
6,1,147,Lilly:,"That's about the size of it.
"
6,1,148,Marshall:,"Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?
"
6,1,149,Lily:,"We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.
"
6,1,150,Marshall:,"So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, ""I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.""
"
6,1,151,Lily:,"Out for three months?
"
6,1,152,Marshall:,"Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.
"
6,1,153,Lily:,"No, we didn't.
"
6,1,154,Marshall:,"I meant, me and my dad.
"
6,1,155,Lily:,"You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?
"
6,1,156,Marshall:,"Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?
"
6,1,157,Lily:,"What?
"
6,1,158,Marshall:,"I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!
"
6,1,159,Cindy:,"Ted?
"
6,1,160,Ted:,"Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?
"
6,1,161,Cindy:,"Hi, Ted!
"
6,1,162,Barney:,"Yeah, she definitely saw you.
"
6,1,163,Cindy:,"Can I see you for a minute... in private?
"
6,1,164,Ted:,"Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.
"
6,1,165,Barney:,"Okay, will do. And dibs.
"
6,1,166,Lily:,"Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?
"
6,1,167,Barney:,"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.
"
6,1,168,Lily:,"Why not?
"
6,1,169,Barney:,"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.
"
6,1,170,Lily:,"That was really...
"
6,1,171,Barney:,"Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!
"
6,1,172,Lily:,"Brief.
"
6,1,173,Barney:,"No. Lily, look. (looking at Robin standing at the bar) You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.
"
6,1,174,The man:,"Hi.
"
6,1,175,Robin:,"14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.
"
6,1,176,Barney:,"Robin, you do look super hot.
"
6,1,177,Robin:,"Oh, do I?
"
6,1,178,Barney:,"Yeah, you do.
"
6,1,179,Robin:,"Thanks.
"
6,1,180,Ted from 2030:,"I braced myself for what was next: rage, fury, a possible shanking.
"
6,1,181,Cindy:,"Thank you, Ted. After things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while. But then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. I feel like I should make it up to you somehow. You know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or...
"
6,1,182,Ted:,"Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.
"
6,1,183,Cindy:,"No, it wouldn't.
"
6,1,184,Ted:,"It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.
"
6,1,185,Cindy:,"I should get back.
"
6,1,186,Ted:,"Totally.
"
6,1,187,Cindy:,"Come say good-bye before you leave.
"
6,1,188,Robin:,"Say good-bye before you leave?
"
6,1,189,Ted:,"Her words exactly.
"
6,1,190,Barney:,"Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!
"
6,1,191,Ted:,"She didn't see us high-six, did she?
"
6,1,192,Barney:,"No. Good. That was pretty lame.
"
6,1,193,Ted:,"Yeah, let's never do that again.
"
6,1,194,Lily:,"Marshall?
"
6,1,195,Marshall:,"What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?
"
6,1,196,Lily:,"Here's the thing.
"
6,1,197,Marshall:,"I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.
"
6,1,198,Marvin:,"Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go?
"
6,1,199,Marshall:,"Dad, this is...
"
6,1,200,Marvin:,"Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back?
"
6,1,201,Marshall:,"Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.
"
6,1,202,Marvin:,"Did it feel like a boy? You can tell.
"
6,1,203,Marshall:,"He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?
"
6,1,204,Lily:,"You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.
"
6,1,205,Marshall:,"Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.
"
6,1,206,Lily:,"What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?
"
6,1,207,Marshall:,"Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.
"
6,1,208,Ted:,"I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.
"
6,1,209,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it. And that night, by golly, Cindy went for it. So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother. She ended up being someone else's mother. In fact, they both did.
"
6,1,210,Robin:,"Like I said, she's here on a date.
"
6,1,211,Ted from 2030:,"So that was not the day I met your mother. The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding.
"
6,1,212,Ted:,"Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.
"
6,1,213,Marshall:,"Dude, it's just a wedding toast.
"
6,1,214,Ted:,"I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.
"
6,1,215,Marshall:,"It will be.
"
6,1,216,Lily:,"Best man? You're being summoned.
"
6,1,217,Ted:,"Geez, what now?
"
6,1,218,Marshall:,"Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.
"
6,1,219,Ted:,"Yeah. You were saying?
"
6,1,220,Marshall:,"You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?
"
6,1,221,Ted:,"No. I didn't bring an umbrella.
"
6,1,222,Marshall:,"I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?
"
6,1,223,Ted:,"No! Of course! Absolutely!
"
6,14,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, when your best friend loses someone...
"
6,14,2,Marshall:,"My dad's dead?
"
6,14,3,Ted from 2030:,"..you drop everything and rush to his side only to find yourself standing there with no idea what to do or say.
"
6,14,4,Ted:,"This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?
"
6,14,5,Lily:,"Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, ""I have to pee."" And I, ""Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you."" Halfway through the pee, I'm, like, ""This doesn't even make sense!""
"
6,14,6,Robin:,"Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.
"
6,14,7,Ted:,"Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.
"
6,14,8,"Robin, hushing:","Be cool, nerds!
"
6,14,9,Lily:,"Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Wait! That can be my role! I'll take care of Judy!
"
6,14,10,Robin:,"Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?
"
6,14,11,"Ted, whispering:","Sweet save.
"
6,14,12,Lily:,"Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty.
"
6,14,13,Ted:,"""Judy duty.""
"
6,14,14,Barney:,"She said ""doody.""
"
6,14,15,Robin:,"Really, guys? At a funeral?
"
6,14,16,Ted:,"Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.
"
6,14,17,Barney:,"Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh.
"
6,14,18,Robin:,"How?
"
6,14,19,Barney:,"Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?
"
6,14,20,Ted:,"Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.
"
6,14,21,Barney:,"Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.
"
6,14,22,Ted:,"What about animals?
"
6,14,23,Barney:,"Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!
"
6,14,24,Marshall:,"Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...?
"
6,14,25,Robin:,"Outlet or USB?
"
6,14,26,Marshall:,"Uh, outlet. Thank you. Oh...
"
6,14,27,Lily:,"Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you?
"
6,14,28,Ted:,"You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.
"
6,14,29,Robin:,"""If""? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. ""Spoonful of sugar...""? Grow up.
"
6,14,30,Reverend:,"I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.
"
6,14,31,Judy:,"Thank you, Reverend.
"
6,14,32,Reverend:,"Unfortunately, I can't. My daughter in Chicago just went into labor. But I'm leaving you in the capable hands of my second-in-command: my son.
"
6,14,33,Marshall:,"Your son?
"
6,14,34,Reverend:,"Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him.
"
6,14,35,Marshall:,"Guys... Trey Platt terrorized me growing up. He was, he was the toughest bully in school.
"
6,14,36,Trey:,"'Sup Marshall.
"
6,14,37,Marshall:,"Hello, Trey. Long time. Mm-hmm. I was not aware that you had become a reverend.
"
6,14,38,Trey:,"Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding!
"
6,14,39,Barney:,"Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh.
"
6,14,40,Ted:,"Yeah! This video is entitled, ""Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can."" I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.
"
6,14,41,Barney & Ted:,"Oh!
"
6,14,42,Barney:,"See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...
"
6,14,43,Ted:,"..right in the nuts,
"
6,14,44,Barney & Ted:,"The fat kid just runs away.
"
6,14,45,Marshall:,"Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey ""The Noogie Machine"" Platt.
"
6,14,46,Ted:,"That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?
"
6,14,47,Marshall:,"He made me carry it.
"
6,14,48,Trey:,"So, my dad has these questions he asks to help create a theme for the service, or whatever. Question one: ""What were your last words with the deceased?"" Lame. Question two:
"
6,14,49,Judy:,"Wait... My last words with Marvin were lovely. I've been thinking about them a lot.
"
6,14,50,Marshall's brother #1:,"Me, too. We went for a hike in the snow and had this amazing talk.
"
6,14,51,Marshall's brother #2:,"My last day with Pop, he taught my son how to skate.
"
6,14,52,Trey:,"Well, this is clearly yielding nothing. Thanks, Dad. Guess I'll have to fill the time with some jokes... again.
"
6,14,53,Judy:,"""Last words"" seems like a good theme. Marshall, do you remember the last thing your father said to you?
"
6,14,54,Judy:,"Bye, sweetie.
"
6,14,55,Marshall:,"Bye, Mom.
"
6,14,56,Marvin:,"Son, there's something I want to say before I leave.
"
6,14,57,Marshall:,"Yeah, Dad?
"
6,14,58,Marvin:,"Could I snag that extra pork chop for the flight?
"
6,14,59,Marshall:,"I was gonna make a sandwich with that, Dad. Dad, don't they have food on the plane?
"
6,14,60,Marvin:,"Yeah, but plane food is ass.
"
6,14,61,Marshall:,"""Plane food is ass."" Those are the last words my father will ever say to me. Right after I denied the man a pork chop. Oh, God. Wait! I'm wrong! I'm wrong! That wasn't it! They couldn't find a cab so my dad called up from the street.
"
6,14,62,Marvin:,"Marshall! Looks like rain out here! I couldn't find an umbrella in your closet! You know who probably has an umbrella?
"
6,14,63,Marshall:,"And then, well, see, my dad grew up in a small town, in another generation, so sometimes - totally well-meaningly - he'd say stuff like...
"
6,14,64,Marvin:,"The Koreans across the hall! Hey, the Koreans are a trustworthy and generous people!
"
6,14,65,Marshall:,"Dad...
"
6,14,66,Marvin:,"I betcha one of the Koreans has an umbrella! Heck, they're Koreans!
"
6,14,67,Marshall:,"My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes.
"
6,14,68,Robin:,"All that stuff was really nice!
"
6,14,69,Lily:,"Yeah! It's positive racism!
"
6,14,70,Marshall:,"This is worse than the pork chop.
"
6,14,71,Barney:,"This next clip is entitled, ""Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull""
"
6,14,72,Ted:,"Let's see what happens.
"
6,14,73,Barney:,"Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.
"
6,14,74,Ted:,"And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.
"
6,14,75,Barney:,"Fall off. Shorts just fall right off.
"
6,14,76,Marshall:,"No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there.
"
6,14,77,Marshall:,"Hey, you were right. The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella.
"
6,14,78,Marvin:,"Of course they did.
"
6,14,79,Judy:,"Bye, sweetie.
"
6,14,80,Marshall:,"Bye, Mom.
"
6,14,81,Marvin:,"Hey, son, I just want to leave you with a little advice. Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night. It totally holds up!
"
6,14,82,Marshall:,"Crocodile Dundee III is the second-best of the Croc trilogy, so maybe I can live with that. (cell phone beeps) Oh, sorry, my phone's charged.
"
6,14,83,Man:,"I, uh, I hear you're a woman who can get things.
"
6,14,84,Robin:,"I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time.
"
6,14,85,Man:,"I need vodka and dirty playing cards.
"
6,14,86,Robin:,"I got ya.
"
6,14,87,Marshall:,"Oh, my God.
"
6,14,88,Lily:,"What is it?
"
6,14,89,Marshall:,"I have a voice mail from my dad.
"
6,14,90,Lily:,"You have a voice mail from your dad?
"
6,14,91,Robin:,"How?
"
6,14,92,Marshall:,"My phone's been out of juice, so he must've called me the day the he, uh...
"
6,14,93,Lily:,"Baby, are you okay?
"
6,14,94,Marshall:,"I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play.
"
6,14,95,Robin:,"What's wrong?
"
6,14,96,Marshall:,"What if it's worse than Crocodile Dundee III? I can't do this. I can't... My mom is about to collapse. I'm gonna...
"
6,14,97,Lily:,"Wait-- no, no, baby... Baby, I got it. Let me.
"
6,14,98,Robin:,"You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.
"
6,14,99,Ted:,"She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?
"
6,14,100,Barney:,"Exactly. All those ""famous last word"" people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?
"
6,14,101,Nathan Hale:,"My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country.
"
6,14,102,Barney:,"You know what his real last words were?
"
6,14,103,Nathan Hale:,"I'm peeing my pants!
"
6,14,104,Barney:,"True story.
"
6,14,105,Robin:,"The point is, last words are overrated.
"
6,14,106,Ted:,"Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.
"
6,14,107,Marshall:,"I should go listen to this... alone, okay? I'll be back.
"
6,14,108,Woman:,"Hey, so, um, I heard you might have...
"
6,14,109,Robin:,"You heard right. (whispering: ) I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here.
"
6,14,110,Lily:,"Guys, listen to what just happened.
"
6,14,111,Lily:,"Judy, do you need a break? I'm happy to cook for a while.
"
6,14,112,Judy:,"You think your snobby New York cooking is better than mine-- admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't you just whip up a batch of your fancy tofu sushi bagels! And choke on them!
"
6,14,113,Ted:,"Whoa. Are you okay?
"
6,14,114,Lily:,"Listen!
"
6,14,115,Judy:,"I'm gonna go take a nap.
"
6,14,116,Lily:,"Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!
"
6,14,117,Ted:,"Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?
"
6,14,118,Lily:,"Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now.
"
6,14,119,Robin:,"Hey, stay hydrated.
"
6,14,120,Barney:,"So?
"
6,14,121,Marshall:,"I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard.
"
6,14,122,Lily:,"We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said.
"
6,14,123,Barney:,"It doesn't. That's true.
"
6,14,124,Marshall:,"Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously.
"
6,14,125,Ted:,"I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.
"
6,14,126,Ted's dad:,"Been fun bro-ing out with you tonight, T-Dawg.
"
6,14,127,Ted:,"Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our s*x lives now. That's totally an improvement.
"
6,14,128,Ted's dad:,"I hooked up with a younger woman the other week-- Donna Bromstead.
"
6,14,129,Ted:,"My prom date?!
"
6,14,130,Ted's dad:,"How far did you get, T-Dawg?
"
6,14,131,Ted:,"I have to go.
"
6,14,132,Marshall:,"How would you like those to be your father's last words?
"
6,14,133,Ted:,"Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.
"
6,14,134,Marshall:,"Lawyered. Lily?
"
6,14,135,Lily:,"Hello.
"
6,14,136,Lily's dad:,"Lily, it's Dad. Listen, I'm sort of in jail for not paying taxes for the last 25 years. ut bright side, I thought of a great new board game. ""Tax Evasion"", ages six to ten. Which is, ironically, what I might be looking at. Anyway, Pumpkin, I need $15,000.
"
6,14,137,Lily:,"Fooled ya. Leave a message after the beep. We'll get back to ya. Beep.
"
6,14,138,Marshall:,"Lawyered. Robin?
"
6,14,139,Robin's dad:,"And so, despite the endless disappointment you've caused me, I pray that this will finally be the year you achieve something of actual significance. I'd love to stop lying to my friends about you being in a coma. Anyway, the point is, happy birthday, RJ.
"
6,14,140,Ted:,"That's awful.
"
6,14,141,Robin:,"No, here's the awful part.
"
6,14,142,Robin:,"You remembered my birthday!
"
6,14,143,Marshall:,"Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal?
"
6,14,144,Everyone:,"Yes.
"
6,14,145,Barney:,"Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called ""German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink.""
"
6,14,146,Marshall:,"Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute.
"
6,14,147,Judy:,"Okay... okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old.
"
6,14,148,Robin:,"Whoa, they grow big out here.
"
6,14,149,Barney:,"And here's your phone number back.
"
6,14,150,Robin:,"Judy, I...
"
6,14,151,Lily:,"I did it.
"
6,14,152,Judy:,"What possible excuse could you have for this?
"
6,14,153,Lily:,"I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny.
"
6,14,154,Judy:,"There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm!
"
6,14,155,Lily:,"That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.
"
6,14,156,Ted:,"Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.
"
6,14,157,Barney:,"Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.
"
6,14,158,Ted:,"Stupid.
"
6,14,159,Barney:,"What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.
"
6,14,160,Ted:,"Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?(Barney hits Ted in the nuts) So that's it? No discussion?
"
6,14,161,Marshall:,"I'm not going to listen. ""Rent Crocodile Dundee II"" are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.
"
6,14,162,Ted:,"Is he laughing?
"
6,14,163,Ted from 2030:,"Marshall really did think he could live with that. That is, until later, at the memorial service.
"
6,14,164,Judy:,"My last talk with Marvin was so lovely.
"
6,14,165,Ted from 2030:,"The stories his mother and brothers told were so perfect.
"
6,14,166,Marshall's brother #1:,"Then he picked my crying son up off the ice. He gave him a hug and said, ""Champ, it doesn't matter if you fall down once in a while.""
"
6,14,167,Marshall's brother #2:,"And as we hiked, a little deer appeared on the path. She hopped over to Dad and started eating-- right out of his hand.
"
6,14,168,Judy:,"And then he kissed me and he said...
"
6,14,169,Marshall's brother #1:,"""I will always be proud of you""""
"
6,14,170,Marshall's brother #2:,"""Life is such a gift.""
"
6,14,171,Judy:,"""You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive.""
"
6,14,172,"Barney, his voice breaking:","Lame.
"
6,14,173,Ted:,"These stories suck.
"
6,14,174,Robin:,"Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.
"
6,14,175,Lily:,"You're up next, baby.
"
6,14,176,Marshall:,"I just need some air.
"
6,14,177,Lily:,"Baby, are you okay?
"
6,14,178,Marshall:,"I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing.
"
6,14,179,Lily:,"Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?
"
6,14,180,Barney:,"She's right. Your dad was hilarious.
"
6,14,181,Marshall:,"You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (scratchy electronic sounds) Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. (scratchy sounds continue) But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?
"
6,14,182,Marvin's voice:,"Marshall? Oh, looks like I've been calling you for almost five minutes. How's my pocket sound? (laughing) Oh, sorry about that, buddy. Um, anyway, your mom and I had such a great time seeing you. I love you.
"
6,14,183,Lily:,"Looks like your dad came through one last time.
"
6,14,184,Marshall:,"""I love you."" My father's last words to me are ""I love you.""
"
6,14,185,Marvin's voice:,"Ooh, and let me know if you find my foot cream. That fungus thing is acting up again.
"
6,14,186,Marshall:,"""I love you."" My father's last words to me are ""I love you.""
"
6,14,187,Everyone:,"Yes. Yes, they were. We heard it. Loud and clear.
"
6,14,188,Marshall:,"Bye, Pop.
"
6,14,189,Ted from 2030:,"So Marshall finally got up to speak. Funny thing, though...
"
6,14,190,Marshall:,"Then my father said the last words that he'll ever say to me: ""Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night and it totally holds up.""
"
6,14,191,Ted from 2030:,"He decided to keep Marvin's real last words just for himself.
"
6,14,192,Judy:,"Thanks.
"
6,14,193,Lily:,"For what?
"
6,14,194,Judy:,"I know what you've been doing today. And I really needed it.
"
6,14,195,Lily:,"Any time.
"
6,14,196,Judy:,"That dress makes you look like a Kansas City whore. Sorry, dear. Last one.
"
6,14,197,Marshall:,"Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III.
"
6,14,198,Ted:,"Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?
"
6,14,199,Marshall:,"Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce.
"
6,14,200,Ted from 2030:,"Last words-- it's a lot of pressure, kids.
"
6,14,201,Ted:,"Hi, Dad.
"
6,14,202,Lily:,"Hi, Dad.
"
6,14,203,Robin:,"Hi, Dad.
"
6,14,204,Barney:,"Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad.
"
6,2,1,Barney:,"So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.
"
6,2,2,Robin:,"What's wrong?
"
6,2,3,Barney:,"I don't want to talk about it.
"
6,2,4,Robin:,"Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?
"
6,2,5,Ted:,"Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!
"
6,2,6,Barney:,"All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!
"
6,2,7,Ted:,"That sucks. I've been there, buddy.
"
6,2,8,Marshall:,"What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.
"
6,2,9,Ted:,"With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.
"
6,2,10,Barney:,"Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.
"
6,2,11,Lily:,"You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?
"
6,2,12,Barney:,"Of course not. It's a two-day job.
"
6,2,13,Robin:,"Pass.
"
6,2,14,Ted:,"Same.
"
6,2,15,Marshall:,"Unsubscribe.
"
6,2,16,Barney:,"You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.
"
6,2,17,Ted:,"No one believes that story.
"
6,2,18,Lily:,"You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.
"
6,2,19,Lily:,"How did he do that?
"
6,2,20,Ted from 2030:,"So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.
"
6,2,21,Barney:,"Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.
"
6,2,22,Ted:,"Yeah, that's what your mom said.
"
6,2,23,Barney:,"How dare you!
"
6,2,24,Ted:,"No, she actually said that.
"
6,2,25,Lauretta:,"Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there.
"
6,2,26,James:,"Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?
"
6,2,27,Everyone:,"James!
"
6,2,28,Barney:,"Bro!
"
6,2,29,Ted:,"How you doing?
"
6,2,30,James:,"Hey!
"
6,2,31,Lauretta:,"Oh, my goodness!
"
6,2,32,James:,"Mama.
"
6,2,33,Lauretta:,"Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.
"
6,2,34,Barney:,"Mom. Stop.
"
6,2,35,Lauretta:,"And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?
"
6,2,36,James:,"Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?
"
6,2,37,Barney:,"Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.
"
6,2,38,Robin:,"So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.
"
6,2,39,Ted:,"Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?
"
6,2,40,Robin:,"Oh, you know, how funny you are...
"
6,2,41,Ted:,"Guilty.
"
6,2,42,Robin:,"Handsome.
"
6,2,43,Ted:,"Who, me?
"
6,2,44,Robin:,"Incredible lover.
"
6,2,45,Ted:,"Really?
"
6,2,46,Robin:,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, ""He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours..."" Blah, blah, blah. ""Orgasms so intense that you just black out."" All that stuff.
"
6,2,47,Ted:,"Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?
"
6,2,48,Robin:,"What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.
"
6,2,49,Ted:,"But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, ""It's the greatest movie ever."" You say, ""Uh, it's pretty good"" And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, ""Sweep the leg!"" And Daniel-san's all like... (high-pitched vocalizations, (mitates whooshing sounds)
"
6,2,50,Robin:,"Maybe I did oversell you a bit.
"
6,2,51,James:,"Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.
"
6,2,52,Lily:,"Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?
"
6,2,53,Barney:,"I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.
"
6,2,54,Barney:,"I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.
"
6,2,55,Marshall:,"That sounds plausible.
"
6,2,56,Barney:,"Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.
"
6,2,57,James:,"Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.
"
6,2,58,Barney:,"Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...
"
6,2,59,Barney:,"""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.
"
6,2,60,Barney:,"Thank you.
"
6,2,61,Marshall:,"Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?
"
6,2,62,James:,"Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.
"
6,2,63,Barney:,"Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?
"
6,2,64,Loretta:,"Oh, I don't know... That guy.
"
6,2,65,Robin:,"Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?
"
6,2,66,James:,"No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.
"
6,2,67,Barney:,"Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...
"
6,2,68,Ted:,"Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.
"
6,2,69,Lily:,"Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was ""sick"" and give him cough medicine until he passed out.
"
6,2,70,Marshall:,"I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4"" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.
"
6,2,71,Lily:,"And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.
"
6,2,72,Marshall:,"Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.
"
6,2,73,Ted:,"I always find that reassuring.
"
6,2,74,Marshall:,"You will meet her, buddy.
"
6,2,75,Ted:,"You think so?
"
6,2,76,Marshall:,"Yeah!
"
6,2,77,Lily:,"Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.
"
6,2,78,Marshall:,"Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?
"
6,2,79,Lily:,"Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?
"
6,2,80,Marshall:,"Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein.
"
6,2,81,Lily:,"I'm not lying to our kids.
"
6,2,82,Barney:,"Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.
"
6,2,83,James:,"Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.
"
6,2,84,Barney:,"Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?
"
6,2,85,James:,"No idea. Why?
"
6,2,86,Barney:,"Mom addressed this and never sent it.
"
6,2,87,James:,"What's in it?
"
6,2,88,Barney:,"Hey. (laughs) It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son.""
"
6,2,89,Loretta:,"Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?
"
6,2,90,James:,"Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?
"
6,2,91,Loretta:,"That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?
"
6,2,92,James:,"There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote ""your son"" on the back.
"
6,2,93,Loretta:,"Oh, no, that... It says ""Yourson."" For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?
"
6,2,94,James:,"If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?
"
6,2,95,Loretta:,"I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!
"
6,2,96,James:,"Can you believe her?
"
6,2,97,Barney:,"I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!
"
6,2,98,Robin:,"So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.
"
6,2,99,Ted:,"How?
"
6,2,100,Robin:,"I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.""
"
6,2,101,Ted:,"Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...
"
6,2,102,Robin:,"""Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.""
"
6,2,103,Ted:,"See, now you went too far in the other...
"
6,2,104,Robin:,"""I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.""
"
6,2,105,Ted:,"Stop!
"
6,2,106,James:,"Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.
"
6,2,107,Barney:,"Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.
"
6,2,108,James:,"Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.
"
6,2,109,Marshall:,"I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.
"
6,2,110,Lily:,"Not now.
"
6,2,111,James:,"This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?
"
6,2,112,Barney:,"So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.
"
6,2,113,James:,"You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.
"
6,2,114,Marshall:,"Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.
"
6,2,115,Lily:,"Oh, what's done is done.
"
6,2,116,Ted:,"""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No.
"
6,2,117,Robin:,"Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?
"
6,2,118,Ted:,"I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.
"
6,2,119,Robin:,"How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn.
"
6,2,120,Ted:,"What?
"
6,2,121,Robin:,"That last bump just made me hit send.
"
6,2,122,Ted:,"Oh, no.
"
6,2,123,Robin:,"Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.
"
6,2,124,Ted:,"No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. ""Everyone""?
"
6,2,125,Barney:,"""Really rich""?
"
6,2,126,James:,"You ready for this?
"
6,2,127,Barney:,"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?
"
6,2,128,James:,"I thought you said that he... Stop.
"
6,2,129,Barney:,"Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.
"
6,2,130,James:,"Come here.
"
6,2,131,Sam Gibbs:,"Can I help you?
"
6,2,132,James:,"Yeah... you're Sam Gibbs.
"
6,2,133,Sam Gibbs:,"Yes.
"
6,2,134,James:,"I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson... in the '70s.
"
6,2,135,Sam:,"Loretta! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I... I knew Loretta.
"
6,2,136,James:,"My mother meant to send you this.
"
6,2,137,Sam:,"You're my son.
"
6,2,138,Lily:,"God, this must be so hard for Barney.
"
6,2,139,Marshall:,"Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...
"
6,2,140,Barney:,"Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!
"
6,2,141,James:,"That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well.
"
6,2,142,Sam:,"Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you.
"
6,2,143,Ted:,"Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.
"
6,2,144,Robin:,"He's also quite the detective.
"
6,2,145,Lily:,"Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.
"
6,2,146,Marshall:,"Or, he could just let him have this one.
"
6,2,147,Ted:,"What?
"
6,2,148,Lily:,"Are you kidding?
"
6,2,149,Marshall:,"Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?
"
6,2,150,Barney:,"Here, Ted. Capture the moment!
"
6,2,151,Ted:,"I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.
"
6,2,152,Barney:,"Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.
"
6,2,153,Ted from 2030:,"During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common.
"
6,2,154,Sam:,"Come on. You know this. Come on.
"
6,2,155,Sam:,"There you go. Come on.
"
6,2,156,Robin:,"Weird day.
"
6,2,157,Ted:,"Weird day.
"
6,2,158,Robin:,"Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!
"
6,2,159,Ted:,"I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!
"
6,2,160,Robin:,"Maybe a little.
"
6,2,161,Ted:,"You said she was a ten.
"
6,2,162,Robin:,"I did not specify on what scale.
"
6,2,163,Ted:,"You said she looked like a movie star.
"
6,2,164,Robin:,"She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.
"
6,2,165,Barney:,"Dad, look how fast I can run!
"
6,2,166,James:,"He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son.
"
6,2,167,Sam:,"I have a grandson?
"
6,2,168,James:,"His name's Eli.
"
6,2,169,Sam:,"He's beautiful.
"
6,2,170,Barney:,"Dad, you're not looking!
"
6,2,171,Ted from 2030:,"Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart.
"
6,2,172,Loretta:,"Barney? I need to talk to you.
"
6,2,173,Barney:,"Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?
"
6,2,174,Loretta:,"Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.
"
6,2,175,Barney:,"Are you sure?
"
6,2,176,Loretta:,"Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is.
"
6,2,177,Ted from 2030:,"And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before.
"
6,2,178,Basketball coatch:,"I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible.
"
6,2,179,Barney:,"What'd Coach say, Ma?
"
6,2,180,Loretta:,"He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.
"
6,2,181,Barney:,"Why didn't anyone come?
"
6,2,182,Loretta:,"Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. ""Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize ""for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party.""
"
6,2,183,Loretta:,"Barney.
"
6,2,184,Barney:,"It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.
"
6,2,185,Loretta:,"But it's your father.
"
6,2,186,Barney:,"I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.
"
6,2,187,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom.
"
6,2,188,Barney:,"Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?
"
6,16,1,Ted from 2030:,"My first kiss with Zoey was amazing, and complicated.
"
6,16,2,Ted:,"Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.
"
6,16,3,Zoey:,"Someone knows how to set a mood.
"
6,16,4,Ted:,"I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.
"
6,16,5,Ted from 2030:,"My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.
"
6,16,6,Barney:," You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.
"
6,16,7,Ted:,"Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.
"
6,16,8,Robin:," Oh. Translation: booty-call.
"
6,16,9,Barney:," Total booty-call.
"
6,16,10,Lily:,"Private Booty, reporting for duty.
"
6,16,11,Ted:,"That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.
"
6,16,12,Robin:," Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, ""What ya doing?"" But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.
"
6,16,13,Lily:,"It's called class, Ted.
"
6,16,14,Ted:,"Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""?
"
6,16,15,Lily:,"Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, ""Stop, Marshall, stop,"" but that's just code for ""harder!""
"
6,16,16,Ted:,"Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?
"
6,16,17,Lily:,"So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.
"
6,16,18,Ted from 2030:,"I should explain. On their very first Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily set out to watch Sleepless in Seattle.
"
6,16,19,Marshall:,"You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.
"
6,16,20,Lily:,"I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.
"
6,16,21,Marshall:,"What girls?
"
6,16,22,ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:,"If it bleeds, we can kill it.
"
6,16,23,Ted from 2030:,"Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.
"
6,16,24,Barney:," Wow, you sound really lonely.
"
6,16,25,Lily:,"I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...
"
6,16,26,Barney:," Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day.
"
6,16,27,Robin:," That's not a thing.
"
6,16,28,Barney:," It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.
"
6,16,29,Ted:,"That's actually true.
"
6,16,30,Barney:," Wait, there's more.
"
6,16,31,Ted:,"This won't be.
"
6,16,32,Barney:," And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.
"
6,16,33,Saint Desperatius:,"Whoa. Check out that one. Her body is a perfect X.
"
6,16,34,Saint Valentine:,"Player, play on. High V.
"
6,16,35,Woman:,"Oh, Jupiter, what are your plans for me? 15 and still unmarried.
"
6,16,36,Saint Desperatius:,"And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.
"
6,16,37,Barney:," Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.
"
6,16,38,Robin:," Please say ""widows.""
"
6,16,39,Barney:," Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,40,Robin:," Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...
"
6,16,41,Barney:," Trolls.
"
6,16,42,Robin:,"...who could care less about Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,43,Barney:," Lying trolls.
"
6,16,44,Robin:," And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.
"
6,16,45,Ted:,"And none was taken until just then.
"
6,16,46,Lily:,"I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.
"
6,16,47,Barney:,"You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?
"
6,16,48,Lily:,"I'm getting weird!
"
6,16,49,Lily:,"See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before.
"
6,16,50,Lily:,"I call him ""Marshpillow."" And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.
"
6,16,51,Robin:," Hey. How was ""baking cookies"" last night?
"
6,16,52,Ted from 2030:,"That was a tough question. You see...
"
6,16,53,Zoey:,"Uh... Is that an overnight bag?
"
6,16,54,Lily:,"You brought an overnight bag?
"
6,16,55,Ted:,"You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.
"
6,16,56,Barney:," We said you were going to have s*x. We didn't say, ""Bring a carry-on.""
"
6,16,57,Robin:," So how did Zoey react?
"
6,16,58,Ted:,"She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.
"
6,16,59,Robin:," Were there slippers for the morning?
"
6,16,60,Ted:,"Not slippers, exactly.
"
6,16,61,Ted:,"They're called British morning socks.
"
6,16,62,Judy:,"This is such a nice surprise. Marshall will be so happy.
"
6,16,63,Lily:,"How are you holding up, Judy?
"
6,16,64,Judy:,"Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but...(chuckles) I'm not a lunatic.
"
6,16,65,Marshall:,"Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here?
"
6,16,66,Lily:,"I wanted to surprise you.
"
6,16,67,Marshall:,"Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?
"
6,16,68,Judy:,"Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes.
"
6,16,69,Marshall:,"Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.
"
6,16,70,Judy:,"Aw... Anything for my baby bear. Get him out of my house. Take Marshall back to New York with you. Please, I am begging you.
"
6,16,71,Lily:,"I thought he was here helping you.
"
6,16,72,Judy:,"Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...
"
6,16,73,Lily:,"Uh, I'll talk to him.
"
6,16,74,Judy:,"I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.
"
6,16,75,Lily:,"Oh, God.
"
6,16,76,Judy:,"There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?
"
6,16,77,Ted:,"Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...
"
6,16,78,Zoey:,"No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to ""bake cookies."" We both knew what that meant.
"
6,16,79,Ted:,"We totally did.
"
6,16,80,Zoey:,"I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, ""Am I ready for this?"" And... the answer is ""yes.""
"
6,16,81,Ted:,"They're actually called British morning socks.
"
6,16,82,Zoey:,"Yeah. Don't get in your own way.
"
6,16,83,Ted:,"Right. Okay.
"
6,16,84,Lily:,"Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.
"
6,16,85,Marshall:,"My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!
"
6,16,86,Judy:,"Oops. Comin' right up!
"
6,16,87,"Marshall, whispers:","She needs this.
"
6,16,88,Lily:,"Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?
"
6,16,89,Marshall:,"Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.
"
6,16,90,Lily:,"Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.
"
6,16,91,Marshall:,"What?
"
6,16,92,Judy:,"Anything else, sweetie?
"
6,16,93,Marshall:,"Mom, d-do you want me to leave?
"
6,16,94,Judy:,"Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not!
"
6,16,95,Lily:,"But, Judy, you said...
"
6,16,96,Judy:,"Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota.
"
6,16,97,Zoey:,"So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.
"
6,16,98,Ted:,"Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.
"
6,16,99,Zoey:,"I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you.
"
6,16,100,Ted:,"Tomorrow night, my place.
"
6,16,101,Zoey:,"I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years.
"
6,16,102,Ted:,"Isn't that great?
"
6,16,103,Robin:," Yeah, if you say so, yeah.
"
6,16,104,Ted:,"What do you mean?
"
6,16,105,Robin:," Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.
"
6,16,106,Ted:,"Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,107,Robin:," See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.
"
6,16,108,Ted:,"Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!
"
6,16,109,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, I'm not super proud of what I did next.
"
6,16,110,Ted:,"Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.
"
6,16,111,Ted from 2030:,"Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night...
"
6,16,112,Barney:," God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.
"
6,16,113,Robin:," Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.
"
6,16,114,Barney:," Enchanté. That's French for ""What's with the purple?""
"
6,16,115,Robin:," Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.
"
6,16,116,Bev:,"I use, uh, colors to express emotion. Purple is for pride. It was a stupid idea.
"
6,16,117,Anna:,"Bev, you look at me. It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens.
"
6,16,118,Robin:," And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.
"
6,16,119,Barney:," Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your ""fiancé"" who no one's ever met.
"
6,16,120,Bev:,"Gerard is real!
"
6,16,121,Lily:,"Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.
"
6,16,122,Ted:,"Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!
"
6,16,123,Judy:,"Is orange juice okay?
"
6,16,124,Ted & Marshall:,"No!
"
6,16,125,Barney:," Okay, when your ""fiancé"" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.
"
6,16,126,Bev:,"Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so...
"
6,16,127,Nora:,"Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.
"
6,16,128,Robin:," Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?
"
6,16,129,Barney:," My elbow slipped!
"
6,16,130,Lily:,"Marshall, I'm going home.
"
6,16,131,Marshall:,"What?
"
6,16,132,Lily:,"I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me.
"
6,16,133,Marshall:,"I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.
"
6,16,134,Lily:,"While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...
"
6,16,135,Ted:,"You have Super Mario Kart?!
"
6,16,136,Marshall:,"Hell, yeah.
"
6,16,137,Lily:,"But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.
"
6,16,138,Marshall:,"Baby, don't go.
"
6,16,139,Lily:,"Please come home soon.
"
6,16,140,Barney:," So, you were an Olympic gymnast?
"
6,16,141,Woman:,"Silver medal.
"
6,16,142,Barney:," Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.
"
6,16,143,Woman:,"That's what my dad said.
"
6,16,144,Barney:," And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.
"
6,16,145,Nora:,"Oh, hi.
"
6,16,146,Barney:," Quick question.
"
6,16,147,Nora:,"Yeah.
"
6,16,148,Barney:," Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?
"
6,16,149,Nora:,"Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?
"
6,16,150,Barney:," Sure.
"
6,16,151,Nora:,"I love Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,152,Barney:," Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?
"
6,16,153,Nora:,"Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?
"
6,16,154,Barney:," Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?
"
6,16,155,Nora:,"We are pitiful.
"
6,16,156,Barney:," The worst.
"
6,16,157,Nora:,"Although there is one difference between you and me.
"
6,16,158,Barney:," What's that?
"
6,16,159,Nora:,"I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.
"
6,16,160,Marshall:,"I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much.
"
6,16,161,Ted:,"I know.
"
6,16,162,Marshall:,"Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.
"
6,16,163,Barney:," All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.
"
6,16,164,Nora:,"What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?
"
6,16,165,Barney:," Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.
"
6,16,166,Nora:,"I have no idea what any of those words mean.
"
6,16,167,Woman:,"Hey, I'm all stretched out!
"
6,16,168,Barney:," Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.
"
6,16,169,Marshall:,"Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.
"
6,16,170,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
6,16,171,Marshall:,"Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?
"
6,16,172,Ted:,"Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.
"
6,16,173,Marshall:,"What?
"
6,16,174,Ted:,"Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.
"
6,16,175,Marshall:,"You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.
"
6,16,176,Ted:,"We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.
"
6,16,177,Marshall:,"So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?
"
6,16,178,Ted:,"Crusts cut off.
"
6,16,179,Marshall:,"Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.
"
6,16,180,Barney:,"...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.
"
6,16,181,Nora:,"Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!
"
6,16,182,Barney:," Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.
"
6,16,183,Robin:," Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.
"
6,16,184,Nora:,"Where are Bev and Anna?
"
6,16,185,Robin:," Well...
"
6,16,186,Bev:,"So, we're taking off.
"
6,16,187,Robin:," What?
"
6,16,188,Anna:,"Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.
"
6,16,189,Robin:," What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?
"
6,16,190,Bev:,"But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,191,Robin:," I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,192,Anna:,"Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.
"
6,16,193,Barney:," I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.
"
6,16,194,Nora:,"Well, I think I'm heading out, too.
"
6,16,195,Barney:," What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!
"
6,16,196,Nora:,"It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye.
"
6,16,197,Robin:," Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...
"
6,16,198,Barney:," What are you talking about?
"
6,16,199,Robin:," Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.
"
6,16,200,Barney:," No, I don't. She's gross.
"
6,16,201,Robin:," Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.
"
6,16,202,Barney:," Whatever you say.
"
6,16,203,Robin:," Oh, hey, Nora.
"
6,16,204,Barney:," Nora...
"
6,16,205,MARVIN:,"Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out! Gotcha.
"
6,16,206,Ted from 2030:,"And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except...
"
6,16,207,Zoey:,"Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set.
"
6,16,208,Ted:,"Well, that was kind of presumptuous.
"
6,16,209,Barney:," The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!
"
6,16,210,Robin:," Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,211,Barney:," Hap...?
"
6,16,212,Nora:,"Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here.
"
6,16,213,Ted from 2030:,"And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day.
"
6,16,214,Barney:," Oh!
"
6,16,215,Nora:,"You will be avenged.
"
6,16,216,SCHWARZENEGGER (over TV):,"Come on! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me!
"
6,16,217,Lily:,"Baby, you're back.
"
6,16,218,Marshall:,"Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh.
"
6,16,219,Lily:,"We both knew this would end eventually.
"
6,17,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day.
"
6,17,2,Ted:,"Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?
"
6,17,3,Wendy:,"Hey, Ted.
"
6,17,4,Ted:,"Hey... There she is. Wow.
"
6,17,5,Wendy:,"Wendy the Waitress.
"
6,17,6,Ted:,"Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?
"
6,17,7,Ted from 2030:,"What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years.
"
6,17,8,Robin:,"So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.
"
6,17,9,Barney:,"I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.
"
6,17,10,Robin:,"Not according to her.
"
6,17,11,Nora:,"Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.
"
6,17,12,Barney:,"You want to grab a drink right now?
"
6,17,13,Nora:,"No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.
"
6,17,14,Barney:,"Absolutely.
"
6,17,15,Robin:,"How is that a disaster?
"
6,17,16,Barney:,"She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...
"
6,17,17,Barney:,"You want to grab a drink right now?
"
6,17,18,Nora:,"No, I'm kind of tired.
"
6,17,19,Barney:,"Absolutely.
"
6,17,20,Barney:,"It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.
"
6,17,21,Robin:,"Please, Cheese. You like this girl.
"
6,17,22,Barney:,"What? Nora? No, I don't.
"
6,17,23,Robin:,"Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.
"
6,17,24,Barney:,"That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?
"
6,17,25,Robin:,"You like her. You should call her.
"
6,17,26,Barney:,"Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.
"
6,17,27,Robin:,"That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.
"
6,17,28,Barney:,"Totally.
"
6,17,29,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet?
"
6,17,30,Woman:,"Oh, Ted, she doesn't want...
"
6,17,31,Ted:,"No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...
"
6,17,32,Ted:,"Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.
"
6,17,33,Zoey:,"Oh, man, this movie is scary.
"
6,17,34,Ted:,"I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.
"
6,17,35,Woman:,"Actually, I said, ""How's your meat?""
"
6,17,36,Ted:,"Oh. A little cold.
"
6,17,37,Woman:,"Gee, wonder why.
"
6,17,38,Zoey:,"Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?
"
6,17,39,Ted:,"Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.
"
6,17,40,Zoey:,"You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.
"
6,17,41,Ted:,"If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.
"
6,17,42,Marshall:,"All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.
"
6,17,43,Ted:,"I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.
"
6,17,44,Lily:,"Yeah, he's been really... quiet.
"
6,17,45,Robin:,"Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.
"
6,17,46,Barney:,"Like Prince.
"
6,17,47,Lily:,"No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.
"
6,17,48,Barney:,"Oh. Ha-wink
"
6,17,49,Lily:,"Excuse me?
"
6,17,50,Barney:,"Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.
"
6,17,51,Lily:,"It's been a while.
"
6,17,52,Barney:,"Five weeks, three days by my estimation.
"
6,17,53,Lily:,"You should work at a carnival.
"
6,17,54,Barney:,"I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.
"
6,17,55,Ted:,"Anyway, we should get going.
"
6,17,56,Lily:,"Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.
"
6,17,57,Robin:,"Good night. Good night, guys.
"
6,17,58,Barney:,"18 weeks.
"
6,17,59,Robin:,"Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...
"
6,17,60,Barney:,"Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.
"
6,17,61,Robin:,"Throw me one? Yeah.
"
6,17,62,Barney:,"We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.
"
6,17,63,Robin:,"Oh, I see what's going on.
"
6,17,64,Barney:,"Yeah?
"
6,17,65,Robin:,"This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.
"
6,17,66,Barney:,"Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?
"
6,17,67,Robin:,"Nora met a guy. What?!
"
6,17,68,Barney:,"What?
"
6,17,69,Robin:,"Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.
"
6,17,70,Barney:,"But ""L'Amour"" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!
"
6,17,71,Lily:,"Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?
"
6,17,72,Marshall:,"I can't sleep.
"
6,17,73,Lily:,"Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?
"
6,17,74,Marshall:,"Maybe after this documentary on garbage.
"
6,17,75,Lily:,"Man, I am losing my touch.
"
6,17,76,Tv:,"Nearly twice the size of Texas, the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch, or ""Garbage Island,"" is an enviwonmental disaster. Sepawated from its pawents, this young bird stwuggles to survive, stwangling itself in the plastic wings of a six-pack. Marshall Eriksen, I think you know what you have to do.
"
6,17,77,Marshall:,"I have to save the planet!
"
6,17,78,Lily:,"Is it over? I call on top.
"
6,17,79,Ted from 2030:,"A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box.
"
6,17,80,Ted:,"I'm here to...
"
6,17,81,Captain:,"Ted. What a surprise. Ted.
"
6,17,82,Ted:,"Captain. I...
"
6,17,83,Captain:,"ou've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.
"
6,17,84,Ted:,"Pssh, nah...
"
6,17,85,Captain:,"ut my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study.
"
6,17,86,Marshall:,"Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!
"
6,17,87,Robin:,"In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...
"
6,17,88,Marshall:,"Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one: the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative.
"
6,17,89,Wendy:,"That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out.
"
6,17,90,Marshall:,"You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.
"
6,17,91,Barney:,"Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.
"
6,17,92,Ted:,"Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.
"
6,17,93,Captain:,"ed, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.
"
6,17,94,Ted:,"Wow.
"
6,17,95,Captain:,"o you have any idea who it could be?
"
6,17,96,Ted from 2030:,"The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true.
"
6,17,97,Captain:,"Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.
"
6,17,98,Ted:,"Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.
"
6,17,99,Captain:,"Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.
"
6,17,100,Ted:,"And that's the last time you saw her.
"
6,17,101,Captain:,"But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.
"
6,17,102,Ted:,"That's damn good brandy.
"
6,17,103,Captain:,"But morning came, and she was gone.
"
6,17,104,Ted:,"Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.
"
6,17,105,Captain:,"I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this.
"
6,17,106,Ted:,"Me. I'm the bad guy.
"
6,17,107,Robin:,"Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.
"
6,17,108,Ted:,"Damn it! The box!
"
6,17,109,Marshall:,"Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.
"
6,17,110,Lily:,"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.
"
6,17,111,Marshall:,"Okay, why not: from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that.
"
6,17,112,Lily:,"Deal. Come on, come on.
"
6,17,113,Marshall:,"Lily!
"
6,17,114,Barney:,"You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.
"
6,17,115,Robin:,"Sorry. Who said anything about an...?
"
6,17,116,Barney:,"Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.
"
6,17,117,Robin:,"No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.
"
6,17,118,Barney:,"No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!
"
6,17,119,Robin:,"You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.
"
6,17,120,Barney:,"No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.
"
6,17,121,Robin:,"Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.
"
6,17,122,Barney:,"Sorry?
"
6,17,123,Robin:,"I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.
"
6,17,124,Barney:,"Careful, Robin, I'll do it.
"
6,17,125,Robin:,"Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.
"
6,17,126,Barney:,"Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.
"
6,17,127,Lily:,"s*x now, we'll do the foreplay after.
"
6,17,128,Marshall:,"Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.
"
6,17,129,Marshall:,"The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...
"
6,17,130,Arthur:,"Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting.
"
6,17,131,Man:,"You did meet Sting.
"
6,17,132,Arthur:,"Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million?
"
6,17,133,Marshall:,"Well, because we can always do more.
"
6,17,134,Arthur:,"Yeah, but I met Sting.
"
6,17,135,Marshall:,"Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!
"
6,17,136,Arthur:,"Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?
"
6,17,137,Meeker:,"Well, he has some good points.
"
6,17,138,Arthur:,"Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen...
"
6,17,139,Man:,"His father just died.
"
6,17,140,Arthur:,"..nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement.
"
6,17,141,Marshall:,"Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.
"
6,17,142,Lily:,"No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.
"
6,17,143,Marshall:,"Hey, baby.
"
6,17,144,Lily:,"Yeah?
"
6,17,145,Marshall:,"What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?
"
6,17,146,Lily:,"Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.
"
6,17,147,Marshall:,"Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?
"
6,17,148,Lily:,"Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.
"
6,17,149,Marshall:,"Well, I do. I got to find those rings!
"
6,17,150,Lily:,"Cwap.
"
6,17,151,Ted:,"Hi, I'm here to pick up...
"
6,17,152,Captain:,"Hello, Ted.
"
6,17,153,Ted:,"To the study?
"
6,17,154,Captain:,"To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.
"
6,17,155,Ted:,"Know what?
"
6,17,156,Captain:,"I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!
"
6,17,157,Ted:,"That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?
"
6,17,158,Captain:,"He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!
"
6,17,159,Ted:,"No, no, no, you can't fire him.
"
6,17,160,Captain:,"You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!
"
6,17,161,Ted:,"Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!
"
6,17,162,Captain:,"Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!
"
6,17,163,Ted:,"Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!
"
6,17,164,Captain:,"Whoa, ""rapscallion"" may be going a bit far, Ted.
"
6,17,165,Ted:,"But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.
"
6,17,166,Captain:,"Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?
"
6,17,167,Ted:,"Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.
"
6,17,168,Captain:,"When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.
"
6,17,169,Ted:,"Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...
"
6,17,170,Captain:,"It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.
"
6,17,171,Ted:,"It's me. You're welcome.
"
6,17,172,Lily:,"Okay, baby, what gives?
"
6,17,173,Marshall:,"I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.
"
6,17,174,Lily:,"I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.
"
6,17,175,Barney:,"All right, Robin, give it to me.
"
6,17,176,Robin:,"Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.
"
6,17,177,Barney:,"The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?
"
6,17,178,Robin:,"It's a five, idiot.
"
6,17,179,Barney:,"A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?
"
6,17,180,Robin:,"""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?
"
6,17,181,Barney:,"How am I supposed to see that's a five?
"
6,17,182,Robin:,"Look how you taped this up...
"
6,17,183,Barney:,"Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.
"
6,17,184,Robin:,"Barney. Go get her.
"
6,17,185,Ted:,"Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?
"
6,17,186,Zoey:,"Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.
"
6,17,187,Ted:,"So I'm the bad guy. Great.
"
6,17,188,Zoey:,"Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.
"
6,17,189,Ted:,"If you say so.
"
6,17,190,Zoey:,"I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.
"
6,17,191,Lily:,"Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?
"
6,17,192,Marshall:,"He'll never get to see how I turn out.
"
6,17,193,Lily:,"What do you mean?
"
6,17,194,Marshall:,"My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.
"
6,17,195,Lily:,"Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?
"
6,17,196,Marshall:,"Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.
"
6,17,197,Lily:,"Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.
"
6,17,198,Marshall:,"I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.
"
6,17,199,Lily:,"Meeker doesn't hate you.
"
6,17,200,Ted from 2030:,"Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it...
"
6,17,201,Meeker:,"Are you guys...?
"
6,17,202,Wendy:,"Closed. Sorry. Thanks.
"
6,17,203,Meeker:,"Rough night?
"
6,17,204,Wendy:,"Yeah.
"
6,17,205,Meeker:,"I'm sorry.
"
6,17,206,Wendy:,"It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.
"
6,17,207,Meeker:,"What did you just say?
"
6,17,208,Wendy:,"Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him?
"
6,17,209,Meeker:,"Know him? I hate that guy.
"
6,17,210,Wendy:,"Me, too.
"
6,17,211,Meeker:,"Well, hey.
"
6,17,212,Ted from 2030:,"And the rest, as they say...is history.
"
6,17,213,Wendy:,"And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.
"
6,17,214,Ted:,"Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.
"
6,17,215,Wendy:,"Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?
"
6,17,216,Ted:,"No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...
"
6,17,217,Wendy:,"Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.
"
6,17,218,Ted:,"Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. (Ted phones Marshall) Hello. Marshall.
"
6,17,219,Marshall:,"Hey, Ted.
"
6,17,220,Ted:,"Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.
"
6,3,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in my early days of being a professor, I had one simple goal: give a lecture that changes someone's life. Then one afternoon in 2010, I achieved that goal.
"
6,3,2,Ted:,"Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is ""unfinished."" Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...
"
6,3,3,Ted from 2030:,"But first, let's back up a few days.
"
6,3,4,Barney:,"Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?
"
6,3,5,Ted:,"I don't know. Got a burger coming.
"
6,3,6,Marshall:,"Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.
"
6,3,7,Barney:,"Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.
"
6,3,8,Barney:,"Hi. Barney Stinson.
"
6,3,9,Marshall:,"And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.
"
6,3,10,Barney:,"Thank you for your time.
"
6,3,11,Barney:,"Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!
"
6,3,12,Robin:,"So, get this: Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast.
"
6,3,13,TV Speaker:,"And now, the 11:00 News with Don Frank.
"
6,3,14,Ted:,"Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?
"
6,3,15,Robin:,"Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something: I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure.
"
6,3,16,Ted:,"That's great. Good for you.
"
6,3,17,Robin:,"Yeah, thank you.
"
6,3,18,Lily:,"Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,3,19,Robin:,"Excuse me?
"
6,3,20,Lily:,"When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,3,21,Robin:," don't know what you're talking about.
"
6,3,22,Lily:,"Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,3,23,Robin:,"here's no poop.
"
6,3,24,Lily:,"Where's the poop?
"
6,3,25,Robin:,"kay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.
"
6,3,26,Robin:,"Hey, Don, here's some breaking news: there's a zit breaking ou on your forehead. Finished with that.
"
6,3,27,Robin:,"Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.
"
6,3,28,Ted:,"That's great.
"
6,3,29,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
6,3,30,Lily:,"Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,3,31,Robin:,"Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail.
"
6,3,32,Robin:,"I am gonna kill you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the killing and eating your face thing.
"
6,3,33,Lily:,"Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.
"
6,3,34,Robin:,"Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.
"
6,3,35,Lily:,"Prove it. Delete contact.
"
6,3,36,Robin:,"There. Deleted.
"
6,3,37,Marshall:,"Back already. How was flying solo? And by ""solo,"" I mean so low that you got shot down.
"
6,3,38,Barney:,"Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.
"
6,3,39,Lily:,"Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?
"
6,3,40,Barney:,"Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that s*x just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have s*x with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her.
"
6,3,41,Ted from 2030:,"The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor.
"
6,3,42,Ted:,"What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.
"
6,3,43,Barney:,"No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?
"
6,3,44,Ted:,"It's my building.
"
6,3,45,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.
"
6,3,46,Barney:,"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?
"
6,3,47,Ted:,"Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...
"
6,3,48,Barney:,"Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.
"
6,3,49,Marshall:,"This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.
"
6,3,50,Ted:,"Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.
"
6,3,51,Robin:,"No? Are you kidding me?
"
6,3,52,Lily:,"But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream.
"
6,3,53,Ted:,"I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall.
"
6,3,54,Marshall:,"Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.
"
6,3,55,Ted:,"For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.
"
6,3,56,Marshall:,"But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.
"
6,3,57,Ted:,"Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.
"
6,3,58,Ted:,"I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?
"
6,3,59,Barney:,"Of course not.
"
6,3,60,Ted:,"All right.
"
6,3,61,Ted from 2030:,"And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night...
"
6,3,62,Ted:,"I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.
"
6,3,63,Barney:,"I need another drink.
"
6,3,64,Ted:,"Marshall, you want anything?
"
6,3,65,Marshall:,"No, I'm fine.
"
6,3,66,Ted:,"Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?
"
6,3,67,Marshall:,"Wait, you turned down the job? When?
"
6,3,68,Ted:,"This morning.
"
6,3,69,Marshall:,"That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...
"
6,3,70,Marshall:,"So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?
"
6,3,71,Barney:,"Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.
"
6,3,72,Ted:,"Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?
"
6,3,73,Marshall:,"Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.
"
6,3,74,Ted:,"Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?
"
6,3,75,Marshall:,"I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.
"
6,3,76,Ted:,"I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.
"
6,3,77,Marshall:,"Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?
"
6,3,78,Barney:,"Chrissy, I love your glasses.
"
6,3,79,Chrissy:,"Really?
"
6,3,80,Barney:,"They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.
"
6,3,81,Marshall:,"The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.
"
6,3,82,Ted:,"But Barney hasn't done...
"
6,3,83,Barney:,"Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.
"
6,3,84,Robin:,"Hey, Lily!
"
6,3,85,Lily:,"Don't ""Hey, Lily"" me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.
"
6,3,86,Robin:,"Oh, no, not this again.
"
6,3,87,Lily:,"Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,3,88,Robin:,"Okay, I left Don another message.
"
6,3,89,Robin:,"""This just in"" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.
"
6,3,90,Lily:,"But that's impossible. You deleted his number.
"
6,3,91,Robin:,"I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, ""Are you sure?"" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.
"
6,3,92,Lily:,"h, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!
"
6,3,93,Robin:,"It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.
"
6,3,94,Lily:,"I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!
"
6,3,95,Robin:,"Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.
"
6,3,96,Lily:,"My ""plezh."" If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.
"
6,3,97,Robin:,"Super Kicks Karate.
"
6,3,98,Lily:,"No, not that one. That's my dojo.
"
6,3,99,Robin:,"You have a dojo?
"
6,3,100,Lily:,"I took an introductory karate class.
"
6,3,101,Lily:,"Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?
"
6,3,102,Boy:,"What's the matter, lady? You scared?
"
6,3,103,Lily:,"Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.
"
6,3,104,Boy:,"I hated kindergarten. All three times.
"
6,3,105,Lily:,"But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.
"
6,3,106,Robin:,"How long ago did you take that class?
"
6,3,107,Lily:,"I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, ""Wassuuuuuuup!""
"
6,3,108,Robin:,"How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.
"
6,3,109,Lily:,"I might.
"
6,3,110,Robin:,"No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.
"
6,3,111,Lily:,"No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.
"
6,3,112,Ted:,"I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.
"
6,3,113,Robin:,"For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.
"
6,3,114,Marshall:,"No! Barney's been ""putting the moves"" on Ted.
"
6,3,115,Lily:,"Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.
"
6,3,116,Marshall:,"No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.
"
6,3,117,Robin:,"Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?
"
6,3,118,Barney:,"Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!
"
6,3,119,Ted:,"He did.
"
6,3,120,Robin:,"And the intense eye contact thing?
"
6,3,121,Barney:,"So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?
"
6,3,122,Ted:,"Okay. Yep.
"
6,3,123,Robin:,"And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?
"
6,3,124,Ted:,"You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.
"
6,3,125,Barney:,"That is so true.
"
6,3,126,Ted:,"Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!
"
6,3,127,Robin:,"So at any point in this did you say, ""Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job""?
"
6,3,128,Ted:,"Well, I mean, not exactly in those...
"
6,3,129,Lily:,"You're loving this.
"
6,3,130,Ted:,"No.
"
6,3,131,Lily:,"You are. You're loving the attention.
"
6,3,132,Ted:,"It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!
"
6,3,133,Robin:,"Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.
"
6,3,134,Ted:,"I am not that kind of architect. So get this...
"
6,3,135,Lily:,"Robin never deleted Don's number.
"
6,3,136,Robin:,"Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.
"
6,3,137,Marshall:,"Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.
"
6,3,138,Robin:,"Edwin.
"
6,3,139,Marshall:,"Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.
"
6,3,140,Robin:,"You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.
"
6,3,141,Marshall:,"No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?
"
6,3,142,Lily:,"Probably not, baby.
"
6,3,143,Robin:,"See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?
"
6,3,144,Marshall:,"Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.
"
6,3,145,Robin:,"Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.
"
6,3,146,Lily:,"Okay. Your turn.
"
6,3,147,Ted:,"Barney, I gotta tell you something.
"
6,3,148,Barney:,"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?
"
6,3,149,Ted:,"Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.
"
6,3,150,Barney:,"Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.
"
6,3,151,Ted:,"Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""
"
6,3,152,Marshall:,"It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.
"
6,3,153,Ted:,"Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.
"
6,3,154,Marshall:,"It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.
"
6,3,155,Ted:,"I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!
"
6,3,156,Ted:,"Okay, I'll do it!
"
6,3,157,Barney:,"What? Ted, it's too late.
"
6,3,158,Ted:,"I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.
"
6,3,159,Barney:,"Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...
"
6,3,160,Marshall:,"Okay, it's a move.
"
6,3,161,Ted:,"What?
"
6,3,162,Barney:,"Dude!
"
6,3,163,Marshall:,"There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.
"
6,3,164,Ted:,"You guys lied to me?
"
6,3,165,Barney:,"You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.
"
6,3,166,Marshall:,"I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!
"
6,3,167,Ted:,"Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.
"
6,3,168,Barney:,"We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.
"
6,3,169,Ted:,"No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...
"
6,3,170,Barney:,"236.
"
6,3,171,Ted:,"..before me fell for. Wow, respect.
"
6,3,172,Marshall:,"No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.
"
6,3,173,Barney:,"Come on, Ted! This is your dream.
"
6,3,174,Ted:,"No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.
"
6,3,175,Robin:,"Hey, guys.
"
6,3,176,Lily:,"Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,3,177,Robin:,"How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.
"
6,3,178,Marshall:,"I think that's just called a dog.
"
6,3,179,Lily:,"Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,3,180,Robin:,"Fine. I called Don again.
"
6,3,181,Robin:,"Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.
"
6,3,182,Lily:,"I thought you deleted his number.
"
6,3,183,Robin:,"I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.
"
6,3,184,Lily:,"Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...
"
6,3,185,Robin:,"I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...
"
6,3,186,Ted:,"Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...
"
6,3,187,Ted:,"Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?
"
6,3,188,Rachel:,"Why aren't you in class?
"
6,3,189,Barney:,"Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.
"
6,3,190,Ted:,"Not so fast. I'm not that easy.
"
6,3,191,Ted from 2030:,"And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. And even though it didn't happen right away...
"
6,3,192,TV Speaker:,"And now, the 11:00 News with Don Frank.
"
6,3,193,Voice:,"Bueno?
"
6,3,194,Robin:,"Who is this?
"
6,3,195,Voice:,"No hablo ingles. Quien es?
"
6,3,196,Robin:,"I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait.
"
6,3,197,Ted from 2030:,"Robin finally got some closure, too.
"
6,3,198,Robin:,"Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that.
"
6,3,199,Lily:,"Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job.
"
6,3,200,Man:,"I knew this day would come.
"
6,7,1,Ted:,"And so, due to one architectural oversight, the Toledo Bridge Disaster of 1906 claimed the lives of 75 people. Now, I hate to stop while I'm on a roll, but happy Halloween, ya crazies!
"
6,7,2,Student #1:,"Hey, Professor Brosby, you gonna come get beers with us later?
"
6,7,3,Ted:,"Nah, I got a thing. But you kids have fun trick or treating. This is a treat.
"
6,7,4,Student #2:,"You're the coolest, Professor Mosby. Well, hot dog.
"
6,7,5,Lily:,"Did it hurt?
"
6,7,6,Ted:,"What?
"
6,7,7,Lily:,"Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass.
"
6,7,8,Ted:,"It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.
"
6,7,9,Barney:,"Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam.
"
6,7,10,Randy:,"Hey, guys.
"
6,7,11,Marshall:,"Hey, Randy. Uh, you want a beer?
"
6,7,12,Randy:,"Oh, no, thank you. I brew my own. At the risk of bragging, my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic.
"
6,7,13,Barney:,"I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.
"
6,7,14,Randy:,"Hey, it just occurred to me, is your friend, what's her name? Garbin, Flabin...
"
6,7,15,Ted:,"Robin?
"
6,7,16,Randy:,"Robin. That's it, yeah. Is she gonna be here? Oh, not that I really care.
"
6,7,17,Lily:,"Robin has another party to go to.
"
6,7,18,Randy:,"No! Damn it! I'm leaving.
"
6,7,19,Lily:,"But she might stop by later.
"
6,7,20,Randy:,"I guess I can hang out a little longer. So, anyone going to see the Halloween parade?
"
6,7,21,Ted from 2030:,"Oh, we were big fans of New York's annual Halloween parade. I don't mean the one that takes place Halloween night in the Village. I mean the one that takes place the morning of November 1st, the Annual Post Halloween Walk of Shame Parade.
"
6,7,22,Marshall:,"Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups.
"
6,7,23,Barney:,"(shudders) Looks like that bee got busy.
"
6,7,24,Ted:,"Looks like that French maid didn't turn down somebody's bed.
"
6,7,25,Marshall:,"Oh, looks like Pocahontas has a couple of wounded knees.
"
6,7,26,Ted:,"Come on, Marshall.
"
6,7,27,Barney:,"That's a line.
"
6,7,28,Marshall:,"No, it's because of the...
"
6,7,29,Ted:,"We get it.
"
6,7,30,Barney:,"Does it get any better than this?
"
6,7,31,Ted:,"Uh, yes. (Robin arrives) Yes, it does.
"
6,7,32,Robin:,"Crap.
"
6,7,33,The Bar:,
6,7,34,Barney:,"There she is Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger.
"
6,7,35,Lily:,"So, who's the lucky patient?
"
6,7,36,Robin:,"I don't want to talk about it.
"
6,7,37,Ted:,"Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.
"
6,7,38,Robin:,"My co-anchor's a woman.
"
6,7,39,Barney:,"Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. (laughing)
"
6,7,40,Ted from 2030:,"Robin had always believed that the key to success was intelligence, hard work and professionalism. Her new co-anchor Becky had a different philosophy.
"
6,7,41,Becky:,"Boats! Boats! Boats!
"
6,7,42,Announcer:,"It's the Farhampton Boat Show! Remember 5th, 6th and 7th at the Farhampton Civic Center. Come on down.
"
6,7,43,Becky:,"B-B-B-Boats!
"
6,7,44,Robin:,"You did a commercial?
"
6,7,45,Becky:,"Why not?
"
6,7,46,Robin:,"You're a journalist! Don't you want to be taken seriously?
"
6,7,47,Becky:,"No. I'm cute.
"
6,7,48,Robin:,"Okay, well, if you really think this is going to help your image.
"
6,7,49,Mike:,"Hi, Becky. Boats, boats, boats! Robin, a little help here?
"
6,7,50,Ted:,"Robin, you gotta not worry so much about being liked.
"
6,7,51,Robin:,"Oh, easy for you to say. Everybody loves you at your job.
"
6,7,52,Ted from 2030:,"That was true of my teaching job. But I was also designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, and well...
"
6,7,53,Zoey:,"Ted Mosby, we don't like you! What do you have to say for yourself, tearing down a beautiful, old building just to put up a stupid band headquarters?
"
6,7,54,Ted:,"Hmm... Boo... freakin'... hoo.
"
6,7,55,Zoey:,"Boo freakin' hoo? That's it? The Arcadian is an architecturally significant...
"
6,7,56,Ted:,"Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great.
"
6,7,57,Zoey:,"Shampoo. You should try it sometime.
"
6,7,58,Ted:,"You don't know the first thing about architecture.
"
6,7,59,Zoey:,"Key - Ted Mosby's car. Go on.
"
6,7,60,Ted:,"I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn.
"
6,7,61,Zoey:,"Oh, good, the eggs are here.
"
6,7,62,Ted:,"Well, I should head up.
"
6,7,63,Ted from 2030:,"No, GNB was not popular. That's why every year they produced a feel-good video to improve the bank's image.
"
6,7,64,GNB announcer:,"What makes Goliath National Bank different from other big banks? Here at GNB, we care.
"
6,7,65,Barney:,"I care about our precious Earth.
"
6,7,66,Randy:,"I care about old people.
"
6,7,67,Man:,"I care about high-yield offshore investments. And so does Tugboat here. Isn't that right, Tugboat?
"
6,7,68,Marshall:,"Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.
"
6,7,69,Barney:,"All you have to do is say ""I care about making dreams come true.""
"
6,7,70,Marshall:,"First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.
"
6,7,71,Barney:,"Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.
"
6,7,72,Randy:,"I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice.
"
6,7,73,Marshall:,"Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?
"
6,7,74,Randy:,"I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that?
"
6,7,75,Marshall:,"They never arrived at the downtown office.
"
6,7,76,Randy:,"They... Well, just to make sure we're on the same page is ""send them downtown"" not an expression for shredding a document?
"
6,7,77,Marshall:,"You shredded them?!
"
6,7,78,Randy:,"Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from.
"
6,7,79,Marshall:,"That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!
"
6,7,80,Randy:,"Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.
"
6,7,81,Barney:,"I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him.
"
6,7,82,Marshall:,"Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...
"
6,7,83,Arthur:,"Oh, whoa, you're wearing a green tie now. I'm wearing a green tie.
"
6,7,84,Marshall:,"GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period.
"
6,7,85,Randy:,"Uh, just want you to know, we are making good progress on this new project. (phone rings) Oh, you gentlemen keep talking, I will answer that. Marshall Eriksen's office. [...] Yeah, I can get that for you. [...] Just a second. Uh... bank. The ""B"" stands for bank. Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight. Oh, yikes. I'd better get Mr. Messy a napkin. (loud clattering)
"
6,7,86,Marshall:,"Period.
"
6,7,87,Lily:,"Just tell me who you slept with!
"
6,7,88,Robin:,"Lily, I don't want to get into it, okay?
"
6,7,89,Lily:,"Aha, it's someone we know. If it was some ding dong we didn't know, you'd just give me his name.
"
6,7,90,Robin:,"Fine. It's Bill Pepper.
"
6,7,91,Lily:,"Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? It's someone we know!
"
6,7,92,Ted:,"So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions?
"
6,7,93,Zoey:,"Yes. How do you sleep at night?
"
6,7,94,Ted:,"What are you doing here?
"
6,7,95,Zoey:,"It was recently made clear to me that I don't know the first thing about architecture, so here I am.
"
6,7,96,Ted:,"Very well, then, let's get started. (clears throat) Some examples of Greek Revival architecture...
"
6,7,97,Zoey:,"Ooh! Ooh! Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?
"
6,7,98,Ted:,"No.
"
6,7,99,Student:,"What's The Arcadian?
"
6,7,100,Zoey:,"Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building that Professor Mosby wants to tear down.
"
6,7,101,Student:,"What?! No, Professor Mosby loves old buildings. He wouldn't do that. Right, Ted?
"
6,7,102,Ted:,"Getting back to Greek Revival...
"
6,7,103,Ted:,"I lost them.
"
6,7,104,Lily:,"Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley...
"
6,7,105,Lily:,"Johnny? Johnny!
"
6,7,106,Lily:,"He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?
"
6,7,107,Ted:,"We're familiar with it.
"
6,7,108,Lily:,"Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...
"
6,7,109,Lily:,"Shuts them right up.
"
6,7,110,Ted:,"Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved.
"
6,7,111,Lily:,"Oh, baby, what's wrong?
"
6,7,112,Marshall:,"Something bad happened.
"
6,7,113,Marshall:,"Randy, hey, have you seen the...
"
6,7,114,Randy:,"Before you get to that, regarding the earlier project I was working on... Voil&agrave;!
"
6,7,115,Marshall:,"That's the Hermanson contract?
"
6,7,116,Randy:,"The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No... (He shredds the file once again) Anyway, what's your thing?
"
6,7,117,Marshall:,"I need the Filbert contract!
"
6,7,118,Randy:,"Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent.
"
6,7,119,Marshall:,"Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.
"
6,7,120,Barney:,"Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.
"
6,7,121,Lily:,"You slept with Randy!
"
6,7,122,Robin:,"What?!
"
6,7,123,Lily:,"Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.
"
6,7,124,Lily:,"Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, ""Boats! Boats! Boats!"" So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition.
"
6,7,125,Robin:,"Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.
"
6,7,126,Randy:,"Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry.
"
6,7,127,Robin:,"That's...exactly what happened.
"
6,7,128,Barney:,"See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.
"
6,7,129,Marshall:,"Randy, hey, what's going on?
"
6,7,130,Randy:,"I just wanted to say no hard feelings.
"
6,7,131,Marshall:,"Thank you. So where you headed now?
"
6,7,132,Randy:,"Downtown. (Randy jumps into the shredder, Marshall wakes up)
"
6,7,133,Marshall:,"No!!
"
6,7,134,Lily:,"It's okay, baby.
"
6,7,135,Ted from 2030:,"It wasn't okay. So the next morning...
"
6,7,136,Marshall:,"Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.
"
6,7,137,Arthur:,"That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.
"
6,7,138,Marshall:,"No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say ""GNB Cares,"" and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?
"
6,7,139,Arthur:,"No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.
"
6,7,140,Marshall:,"Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.
"
6,7,141,Arthur:,"Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...
"
6,7,142,Marshall:,"No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.
"
6,7,143,Arthur:,"I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.
"
6,7,144,Ted:,"Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?
"
6,7,145,Student:,"A piece of New York history is being torn down, and all you could say was ""Boo freakin' hoo""?
"
6,7,146,Ted:,"Boo... freakin'...
"
6,7,147,Zoey:,"I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack.
"
6,7,148,Ted:,"The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?
"
6,7,149,Zoey:,"Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?
"
6,7,150,Ted:,"No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.
"
6,7,151,Ted from 2030:,"They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell.
"
6,7,152,Lily:,"And did it work?
"
6,7,153,Ted:,"Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.
"
6,7,154,Randy:,"Hey, guys.
"
6,7,155,Barney:,"Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy murdered him.
"
6,7,156,Lily:,"No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.
"
6,7,157,Randy:,"Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?
"
6,7,158,Ted:,"I'm trying to eat here, buddy.
"
6,7,159,Lily:,"No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.
"
6,7,160,Randy:,"What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.
"
6,7,161,Lily:,"You didn't sleep with her?
"
6,7,162,Randy:,"No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging.
"
6,7,163,Lily:,"So why are you smiling?
"
6,7,164,Randy:,"I'll tell you why.
"
6,7,165,Marshall:,"This just isn't working out.
"
6,7,166,"Randy, thinking:","I'm fired. Great. This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again. Wait a minute. I can get a severance check. If I don't shred it, I can use that money to start my own brewery. Imagine a beer with my name on it. Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life.
"
6,7,167,Randy:,"Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.
"
6,7,168,Marshall:,"Randy, great news! You're not fired!
"
6,7,169,"Randy, wailing:","No...!
"
6,7,170,Ted:,"Good morning, everybody... Where's my class?
"
6,7,171,Zoey:,"Hello, Professor. Ha-boom.
"
6,7,172,Marshall:,"I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.
"
6,7,173,Randy:,"But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!
"
6,7,174,Marshall:,"Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.
"
6,7,175,Randy:,"I-I can't. I need my severance check.
"
6,7,176,Marshall:,"Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.
"
6,7,177,Randy:,"It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it.
"
6,7,178,Marshall:,"Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...
"
6,7,179,Randy:,"Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.
"
6,7,180,"Arthur, entering the room:","Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday. Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry. And I want to assure you you will never be fired again. You're going to work here until you die, huh? Green tie? (clears throat) Nice choice.
"
6,7,181,Randy:,"Thanks. It brings out my eyes.
"
6,7,182,Arthur:,"Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.
"
6,7,183,Marshall:,"Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.
"
6,7,184,Randy:,"Oh, we'll see about that.
"
6,7,185,Barney:,"Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. ""We care about making dreams come true,"" in three, two...
"
6,7,186,Randy:,"No!
"
6,7,187,Marshall:,"What are you doing?
"
6,7,188,Randy:,"Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.
"
6,7,189,Marshall:,"No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.
"
6,7,190,Randy:,"And there's more.
"
6,7,191,Marshall:,"I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.
"
6,7,192,Randy:,"Now am I fired?
"
6,7,193,Marshall:,"I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.
"
6,7,194,Barney:,"I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.
"
6,7,195,Marshall:,"Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.
"
6,7,196,Barney:,"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.
"
6,7,197,Marshall:,"That's just the pick-me-up I needed.
"
6,7,198,Barney:,"Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?
"
6,7,199,Lily:,"Hello.
"
6,7,200,Ted:,"It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?
"
6,7,201,Lily:,"You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...
"
6,7,202,Ted:,"I like my teachers.
"
6,7,203,Lily:,"..are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.
"
6,7,204,Ted:,"Was there more to that story?
"
6,7,205,Lily:,"A little bit.
"
6,7,206,Ted:,"Lily, you're a psychopath.
"
6,7,207,Lily:,"A little bit. Oh, a panda!
"
6,7,208,Ted from 2030:,"I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try.
"
6,7,209,Zoey:,"Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us?
"
6,7,210,Ted:,"Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an ""F.""
"
6,7,211,Lily:,"You said that?
"
6,7,212,Ted:,"Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought ""F"" had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?
"
6,7,213,Lily:,"Yeah.
"
6,7,214,Robin:,"Hey, guys.
"
6,7,215,Lily:,"Robin, who'd you sleep with?
"
6,7,216,Robin:,"I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.
"
6,7,217,Lily:,"Where's the poop, Robin?
"
6,7,218,Robin:,"Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.
"
6,7,219,Ted:,"What... Why didn't you tell us?
"
6,7,220,Announcer:,"Bladder trouble; it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone.
"
6,7,221,Robin:,"I'm going to the bathroom right now.
"
6,7,222,Announcer:,"Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone.
"
6,7,223,Robin:,"Say... ""Ah...""
"
6,7,224,Ted:,"Wow! I can't wait to see it.
"
6,7,225,Robin:,"Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.
"
6,7,226,Ted from 2030:,"It ran for seven years.
"
6,7,227,Randy:,"Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream, big-time lawyer at a huge corporation.
"
6,7,228,Marshall:,"You think working here is my dream?
"
6,7,229,Randy:,"Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk.
"
6,7,230,Marshall:,"Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.
"
6,7,231,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because...
"
6,7,232,Marshall:,"I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?
"
6,7,233,Barney:,"Yep. That's a wrap.
"
6,13,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, when Lily and Marshall started trying to have a baby, they went a little crazy.
"
6,13,2,Lily:,"We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children.
"
6,13,3,Doctor:,"And how long have you been trying?
"
6,13,4,Lily:,"Six days.
"
6,13,5,Ted from 2030:,"But then, months went by, and still nothing happened.
"
6,13,6,Lily:,"Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot.
"
6,13,7,Marshall:,"And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen.
"
6,13,8,Lily:,"Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?
"
6,13,9,Doctor:,"Look, if you're really worried, here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel. He's the best in the city.
"
6,13,10,Marshall:,"Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?
"
6,13,11,Lily:,"Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected s*x day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.
"
6,13,12,Barney:,"Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.
"
6,13,13,Marshall:,"I'm not playing laser tag.
"
6,13,14,Ted:,"I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.
"
6,13,15,Marshall:,"Damn it.
"
6,13,16,Barney:,"And Marshall's the winner.
"
6,13,17,Lily:,"Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt.
"
6,13,18,Ted from 2030:,"So Aunt Lily went to see Dr. John Stangel, the man who knew more about human reproduction than anyone in New York City.
"
6,13,19,Stangel:,"So I understand you want to get pregnant.
"
6,13,20,Barney:,"Yeah, and it cuts in and out.
"
6,13,21,Lily:,"Ooh! How did you do it?
"
6,13,22,Barney:,"Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?
"
6,13,23,Lily:,"What are you talking about?
"
6,13,24,Barney:,"What are you talking about?
"
6,13,25,Lily:,"My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.
"
6,13,26,Strangel:,"We'll look at all the factors that contribute to fertility: dietary, environmental, genetic. But first, Ms. Aldrin, do you have any questions for me?
"
6,13,27,Lily:,"Just one, ""Dr. Stangel"". Where'd you get the beard?
"
6,13,28,Strangel:,"Well, m... my mother's Armenian.
"
6,13,29,Marshall:,"Lily, I've been with Barney since 9:00 a.m. Between the sexual harassment seminar all morning and the secretary beauty pageant all afternoon, he hasn't left my sight.
"
6,13,30,Lily:,"Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?
"
6,13,31,Barney:,"Not today I wasn't.
"
6,13,32,Ted:,"Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney.
"
6,13,33,Lily:,"Uh, Marshall?
"
6,13,34,Marshall:,"Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...
"
6,13,35,Lily:,"No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.
"
6,13,36,Barney:,"Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.
"
6,13,37,Lily:,"I still kind of think it's Barney.
"
6,13,38,Marshall:,"There's no way it's Barney.
"
6,13,39,Stangel:,"Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen. I am Dr. Stangel.
"
6,13,40,Marshall:,"It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?
"
6,13,41,Stangel:,"Would you...? I...
"
6,13,42,Marshall:,"So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.
"
6,13,43,Stangel:,"All right, Ms. Aldrin, please just put your feet up in the stirrups. We can begin.
"
6,13,44,Lily:,"Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.
"
6,13,45,Marshall:,"No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard.
"
6,13,46,Stangel:,"He checks out. I really don't have time for this.
"
6,13,47,Marshall:,"No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?
"
6,13,48,Barney:,"Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.
"
6,13,49,Stangel:,"Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the v*g1n*.
"
6,13,50,Lily:,"Okay. Convinced.
"
6,13,51,Stangel:,"Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up.
"
6,13,52,Lily:,"""Suit up""... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven.
"
6,13,53,Marshall:,"Baby, you just saw Barney.
"
6,13,54,Lily:,"He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit?
"
6,13,55,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah... Bjorney.
"
6,13,56,Lily:,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.
"
6,13,57,Barney:,"How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!
"
6,13,58,Strangel:,"Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results.
"
6,13,59,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
6,13,60,Barney:,"Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!
"
6,13,61,Lily:,"Can we leave him in here for a while?
"
6,13,62,Strangel:,"I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night.
"
6,13,63,Barney:,"Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!
"
6,13,64,Ted from 2030:,"Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate.
"
6,13,65,Ted:,"So, first day of work?
"
6,13,66,Woman:,"Everyone, say hello to your new research associate Robin Scherbatsky.
"
6,13,67,Robin:,"Hi, guys.
"
6,13,68,Woman:,"Oh, here comes our new Hardfire host. Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.
"
6,13,69,Ted:,"Sandy Rivers?!
"
6,13,70,Ted from 2030:,"Sandy Rivers... Robin's old co-host and my old nemesis.
"
6,13,71,Sandy:,"We should have s*x.
"
6,13,72,Ted:,"Oh, I hate that guy.
"
6,13,73,Robin:,"It gets worse.
"
6,13,74,Woman:,"Sandy, this is...
"
6,13,75,Sandy:,"Robin.
"
6,13,76,Woman:,"You two know each other?
"
6,13,77,Sandy:,"Know each other? We've had s*x.
"
6,13,78,Ted:,"You had s*x with Sandy Rivers?
"
6,13,79,Robin:,"No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show.
"
6,13,80,Ted:,"Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?
"
6,13,81,Robin:,"Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.
"
6,13,82,Marshall:,"Hey, babe.
"
6,13,83,Lily:,"Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes.
"
6,13,84,Marshall:,"Yeah, uh, we got a game of ""Go Fish"" going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from?
"
6,13,85,Lily:,"Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile.
"
6,13,86,Marshall:,"You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem.
"
6,13,87,Lily:,"Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.
"
6,13,88,Marshall:,"Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected s*x 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem.
"
6,13,89,Barney:,"Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.
"
6,13,90,Ted:,"So, second day of work?
"
6,13,91,Lily:,"What's wrong?
"
6,13,92,Ted:,"Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.
"
6,13,93,Lily:,"Already? Oh, honey.
"
6,13,94,Robin:,"I wish I was the office slut.
"
6,13,95,Robin:,"And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq.
"
6,13,96,Sandy:,"Yes. We definitely had s*x.
"
6,13,97,Robin:,"We did not have s*x.
"
6,13,98,Sandy:,"Then why do I remember you?
"
6,13,99,Robin:,"I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional.
"
6,13,100,Sandy:,"No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have s*x.
"
6,13,101,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
6,13,102,Sandy:,"You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop...
"
6,13,103,Robin:,"We did have s*x.
"
6,13,104,Sandy:,"Oh, I... I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor.
"
6,13,105,Robin:,"But this reporter takes pride in...
"
6,13,106,Robin:,"And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny.
"
6,13,107,Ted:,"Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid.
"
6,13,108,Barney:,"Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney guns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.
"
6,13,109,Marshall:,"Oh, it's my dad.
"
6,13,110,Ted:,"Aren't you going to get it?
"
6,13,111,Marshall:,"No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up.
"
6,13,112,Ted:,"He has to do that?
"
6,13,113,Robin:,"But I thought you talk to your dad about everything.
"
6,13,114,Marshall:,"I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me.
"
6,13,115,Marshall:,"I'm getting married!
"
6,13,116,Marvin:,"Yeah...!
"
6,13,117,Marshall:,"I passed the bar!
"
6,13,118,Marvin:,"All right!
"
6,13,119,Marshall:,"I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord.
"
6,13,120,Marvin:,"That's what I'm talking about!
"
6,13,121,Marshall:,"Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp!
"
6,13,122,Marshall:,"But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.
"
6,13,123,Barney:,"I'll show you. ""Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion"".
"
6,13,124,Marshall:,"Barney, I've already told...
"
6,13,125,Barney:,"""Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome"".
"
6,13,126,Ted:,"So, third day of work?
"
6,13,127,Robin:,"And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...
"
6,13,128,Sandy:,"Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius.
"
6,13,129,Robin:,"Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.
"
6,13,130,Sandy:,"A few?
"
6,13,131,Robin:,"Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one.
"
6,13,132,Sandy:,"Gregory.
"
6,13,133,Ted:,"Oh, God. What did they find?
"
6,13,134,Robin:,"Everything.
"
6,13,135,Robin:,"*Everybody, come and play*... I'm a dirty, dirty girl... *Throw every last care away; Let's go to the mall today; Today, today*... The Federal Reserve Board voted to leave interest... * Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Let's got to the mall today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today; Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today... ; Let's go to the mall... *
"
6,13,136,Robin:,"They even found the video of me getting attacked by an owl.
"
6,13,137,Ted:,"You got attacked by an owl?
"
6,13,138,Robin:,"I did not get attacked by an owl.
"
6,13,139,Ted:,"Robin, listen, here's what you need to do...
"
6,13,140,Robin:,"Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job.
"
6,13,141,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, at that moment, I knew what I had to do for my friend Robin. But first I had to do something for me.
"
6,13,142,Ted:,"Show me ""owl attack"".
"
6,13,143,Marshall:,"I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot.
"
6,13,144,Stangel:,"Well, we won't know anything until we run some tests. We'll need a sample of your sperm. No, no, no. There's a room at the end of the hall. If you find yourself inside the elevator, you've gone too far. You'd think I wouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised.
"
6,13,145,Man #1:,"All yours, buddy. The thing you're about to do in here... I did that in here, too. Three minutes ago.
"
6,13,146,Man #2:,"I was here eight minutes ago.
"
6,13,147,Man #3:,"14 minutes ago.
"
6,13,148,Man #4:,"I'm here every Thursday.
"
6,13,149,Marshall:,"I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I... Could I take this home?
"
6,13,150,Stangel:,"Sure, you could, but, uh... we close in an hour and I'm not back till Tuesday. So, clock is ticking. Make it fast.
"
6,13,151,Marshall:,"Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how.
"
6,13,152,Marvin:,"Surprise!
"
6,13,153,Judy:,"Surprise!
"
6,13,154,Marshall:,"Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here?
"
6,13,155,Judy:,"We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you.
"
6,13,156,Marvin:,"For God's sake, son. Do you have any sixes?
"
6,13,157,Marshall:,"Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute?
"
6,13,158,Lily:,"Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height.
"
6,13,159,Marshall:,"Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else.
"
6,13,160,Lily:,"Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well... Wait, wait, wait. Marshall.
"
6,13,161,Marshall:,"Thank you, baby. You're the best.
"
6,13,162,Judy:,"Marshall. Marshall. I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer. It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine? Me in a two-piece bathing suit at my age? Just picture it! Picture it!
"
6,13,163,Marvin:,"That's why Fred Cox is the greatest kicker the Vikings ever had.
"
6,13,164,Marvin:,"Give me a ""C"". Give me an ""O"". Give me an ""X"". What's that spell? Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox!
"
6,13,165,Ted:,"Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address.
"
6,13,166,Robin:,"Who?
"
6,13,167,Ted:,"Sorry. You said ""who"". It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. ""Who"". Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.
"
6,13,168,Robin:,"Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there.
"
6,13,169,Ted:,"I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.
"
6,13,170,Robin:,"Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists.
"
6,13,171,Ted:,"They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.
"
6,13,172,Sandy:,"Ah... You're not the pizza guy.
"
6,13,173,Robin:,"Oh, my God. This is...
"
6,13,174,Ted:,"This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down.
"
6,13,175,Robin:,"If people found out Sandy wears a toupee...
"
6,13,176,Ted:,"Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?
"
6,13,177,Robin:,"Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy.
"
6,13,178,Judy:,"And the top is so low-cut. Your father says he has front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins. Oh. Oh. By the way, Marshall, we do need to know if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming? Marshall? Marshall, are you coming?
"
6,13,179,Marshall:,"This isn't working.
"
6,13,180,Marvin:,"Where you going, son?
"
6,13,181,Marshall:,"I'm... I'm going to... I'm... I'm going to...
"
6,13,182,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, to this day, your uncle Marshall is thankful for what Lily said next.
"
6,13,183,Lily:,"He's going to m*st*rb*t*.
"
6,13,184,Marshall:,"Lily!
"
6,13,185,Lily:,"Marshall, just tell them what's going on.
"
6,13,186,Ted from 2030:,"And so Marshall told his parents everything.
"
6,13,187,Marshall:,"And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild.
"
6,13,188,Judy:,"Aw, Marshall. Hey, we don't care about that one bit. And if you guys want kids, there are other ways. Adoption. Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm?
"
6,13,189,Marshall:,"Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption.
"
6,13,190,Marvin:,"What I'm saying is, we love you no matter what. Now, why don't you pretend you're in high school, get back in that bathroom, and ""blow dry your hair"".
"
6,13,191,Marshall:,"Wait, you knew?
"
6,13,192,Judy:,"We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.
"
6,13,193,Ted:,"So? Possibly last day of work?
"
6,13,194,Robin:,"Actually, it was a good day.
"
6,13,195,Sandy:,"And I need more numbers on how the holiday season impacted the economy. Sparkles, got anything on malls?
"
6,13,196,Robin:,"Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see.
"
6,13,197,Ted:,"Yes! Put him in a body bag!
"
6,13,198,Robin:,"Okay, I didn't do it.
"
6,13,199,Ted:,"What?
"
6,13,200,Robin:,"I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of...
"
6,13,201,Ted:,"Owl?
"
6,13,202,Robin:,"Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice.
"
6,13,203,Ted from 2030:,"That day, Robin decided to steer into the skid. And though she never quite shook the nickname, Sparkles went on to do very well at World Wide News. Especially after this happened.
"
6,13,204,Ted from 2030:,"After his parents had gone back to Minnesota, Marshall got the results of his test.
"
6,13,205,Stangel:,"I'm afraid I have some very bad news, Marshall. Judging from the results of your test, it is... it is very unlikely that you'll be able to father a child.
"
6,13,206,Marshall:,"Oh, God.
"
6,13,207,Stangel:,"I know, I know.
"
6,13,208,Marshall:,"It's just...
"
6,13,209,Stangel:,"Now... in some rare cases, a regimen change can fix the problem, so I'm recommending a spirited cardio routine. Preferably with a partner, involving any light-based firearm activity in the Tri-State area. Poughkeepsie, for example. Have you heard of the gentlemen's sport known as laser tag? Surprise!
"
6,13,210,Marshall:,"Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?
"
6,13,211,Barney:,"Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20% off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation?
"
6,13,212,Stangel:,"Go! Well, Marshall. I've got your results.
"
6,13,213,Marshall:,"And?
"
6,13,214,Stangel:,"Your sperm is fine.
"
6,13,215,Marshall:,"My sperm is fine!
"
6,13,216,Stangel:,"Count, motility... everything's off the charts. You, sir, have got some strong swimmers.
"
6,13,217,Barney:,"Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!
"
6,13,218,Marshall:,"Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? I want to call my dad.
"
6,13,219,Ted:,"Yeah, go ahead.
"
6,13,220,Marshall:,"Man, this is great. I was expecting bad news. I really was.
"
6,13,221,Marshall:,"You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it?
"
6,13,222,Lily:,"Marshall... Something's happened. Um... Your father, he had a heart attack. He... he didn't make it.
"
6,13,223,Marshall:,"My dad's dead? I'm not ready for this.
"
6,12,1,Ted from 2030:,"In December of 2010, my friends and I decided to go see It's a Wonderful Life on the big screen. It seemed like something we all needed. After all, it had been a crazy couple of days. It all started...
"
6,12,2,Ted from 2030:,"With a pregnancy test.
"
6,12,3,Marshall:,"This is taking forever. Are you sure you did it right?
"
6,12,4,Lily:,"Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick?
"
6,12,5,Marshall:,"Hey, can I ask you a question that's plagued me for years? Can girls aim?
"
6,12,6,Lily:,"Um, can boys aim? 'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop to that bathroom floor every two days.
"
6,12,7,Marshall:,"Okay, you're the one who put the Far Side calendar up over the toilet. You know I laugh with my whole body.
"
6,12,8,Lily:,"It's been two minutes.
"
6,12,9,Marshall & Lily:,"One, two, three.
"
6,12,10,Lily:,"It's positive.
"
6,12,11,Marshall:,"It's positive? It's positive.
"
6,12,12,Lily:,"I'm pregnant.
"
6,12,13,Robin:,"What?!
"
6,12,14,Barney:,"I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!
"
6,12,15,Robin:,"To Lily and Marshall.
"
6,12,16,Marshall:,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now.
"
6,12,17,Doctor:,"You're not pregnant.
"
6,12,18,Marshall:,"Well, that did it.
"
6,12,19,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours we all thought Lily was pregnant, and how it caused each of us to reexamine our own lives. Because while this was happening...
"
6,12,20,Marshall:,"Are you sure you did it right?
"
6,12,21,Ted from 2030:,"..I was on the phone with Punchy, my best friend from high school, who had recently asked me to be his best man.
"
6,12,22,Ted:,"Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements.
"
6,12,23,Punchy:,"Ah, here it comes. Hit me up, Schmos!
"
6,12,24,Ted:,"Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.
"
6,12,25,Punchy:,"That's exactly the accent of whimsy this celebration of love needs!
"
6,12,26,Ted:,"It's gonna be a magical day. (Ted hangs up) I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude.
"
6,12,27,Robin:,"I do wish you were a dude.
"
6,12,28,Ted:,"Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.
"
6,12,29,Robin:,"No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his rifle and charge up the hill.
"
6,12,30,Ted:,"Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man.
"
6,12,31,Robin:,"And how did that go again? Oh for one.
"
6,12,32,Ted:,"Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.
"
6,12,33,Robin:,"Ted. (Both yelling) Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?
"
6,12,34,Ted:,"Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of Million Dollar Heads or Tails.
"
6,12,35,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails was an extremely popular show with an extremely simple premise.
"
6,12,36,Animator:,"All right, your practice flip came up tails... But our Vegas oddsmaker tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50. And so, Jordan, for one million dollars......Heads... or tails? (Audience shouting suggestions)
"
6,12,37,Jordan:,"What was the year of the coin again?
"
6,12,38,Ted:,"Why this sudden obsession with Heads or Tails?
"
6,12,39,Robin:,"Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails has a job opening.
"
6,12,40,Jordin:,"Ta... heads.
"
6,12,41,Animator:,"Marni, flip that coin.
"
6,12,42,Robin:,"So now, because of that incident, Heads or Tails is looking for a new currency rotation specialist.
"
6,12,43,Ted:,"You mean coin flip bimbo?
"
6,12,44,Robin:,"They're not bimbos!
"
6,12,45,Ted:,"You auditioned, didn't you?
"
6,12,46,Ted:,"You're the new coin flip bimbo?
"
6,12,47,Robin:,"Currency rotation specialist.
"
6,12,48,Ted:,"Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you?
"
6,12,49,Robin:,"Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses!
"
6,12,50,Ted:,"Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?
"
6,12,51,Robin:,"I am never drinking again.
"
6,12,52,Ted:,"No, before that.
"
6,12,53,"Robin, slurring:","I am gonna finish this whole bottle tonight.
"
6,12,54,Ted:,"Before that, too.
"
6,12,55,Robin:,"I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth.
"
6,12,56,Ted:,"I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.
"
6,12,57,Robin:,"Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job.
"
6,12,58,Ted:,"Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.
"
6,12,59,Robin:,"Well, so could Heads or Tails. (snorts) The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on The Bachelor, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on The Biggest Loser, and now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.
"
6,12,60,Ted from 2030:,"It seemed like there was no changing Robin's mind. But what we didn't know, in that moment, was that our world was about to be turned upside down.
"
6,12,61,Lily:,"I'm pregnant.
"
6,12,62,Robin:,"What?!
"
6,12,63,Ted from 2030:,"Now, kids, when your friends have great news, you're happy for them... For, like, a millisecond. And then you start thinking about yourself.
"
6,12,64,Robin:,"Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job.
"
6,12,65,Ted from 2030:,"And so, the next night, we had two things to celebrate.
"
6,12,66,Robin:,"Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News.
"
6,12,67,Marshall:,"Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news.
"
6,12,68,Ted:,"What changed your mind?
"
6,12,69,Robin:,"Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist... (quietly) Who gives her beer.
"
6,12,70,Lily:,"What?
"
6,12,71,Robin:,"What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.
"
6,12,72,Marshall:,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.
"
6,12,73,Ted from 2030:,"So the next day Robin called Heads or Tails to respectfully decline.
"
6,12,74,Robin:,"Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky.
"
6,12,75,Ted from 2030:,"But at that moment...
"
6,12,76,Doctor:,"You're not pregnant.
"
6,12,77,Robin:,"As honored as I am by the offer, um... (Phone chirps) Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty.
"
6,12,78,Robin:,"You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo.
"
6,12,79,Ted:,"You took the Heads or tails job?
"
6,12,80,Robin:,"Yeah.
"
6,12,81,Ted:,"What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.
"
6,12,82,Robin:,"Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?
"
6,12,83,Ted:,"We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.
"
6,12,84,Robin:,"Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy.
"
6,12,85,Ted:,"Where the hell is Barney?
"
6,12,86,Ted from 2030:,"Where was Barney? Let's back up again.
"
6,12,87,Ted from 2030:,"You see, while this was going on...
"
6,12,88,Marshall & Lily:,"It's positive.
"
6,12,89,Ted from 2030:,"..This was happening.
"
6,12,90,Robin:,"And now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.
"
6,12,91,Barney:,"Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?
"
6,12,92,Ted:,"Bon Jovi?
"
6,12,93,Barney:,"Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n? (Imitates buzzer) Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check.
"
6,12,94,Ted:,"My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee.
"
6,12,95,Barney:,"And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit.
"
6,12,96,Ted:,"Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?
"
6,12,97,Barney:,"Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang.
"
6,12,98,Marshall:,"Hey, guys. Big announcement.
"
6,12,99,Ted:,"Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too.
"
6,12,100,Marshall:,"No, just a $30 gift card to Costa Coffee.
"
6,12,101,Ted:,"Thirty?!
"
6,12,102,Lily:,"I'm pregnant.
"
6,12,103,Robin:,"What?!
"
6,12,104,Barney:,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!
"
6,12,105,Barney:,"Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?
"
6,12,106,Marshall:,"we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.
"
6,12,107,Barney:,"Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight, (imitating Oprah) is Barney's Favorite Things!
"
6,12,108,Ted from 2030:,"That was the reaction Barney expected. This was the one he got.
"
6,12,109,Marshall:,"Huh? I don't know what that is.
"
6,12,110,Barney:,"Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?
"
6,12,111,Ted from 2030:,"The next hour got pretty weird.
"
6,12,112,Barney:,"Velour track suits!
"
6,12,113,Marshall:,"Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.
"
6,12,114,Barney:,"Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club! (Applause, cheering) You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more.
"
6,12,115,Ted:,"No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.
"
6,12,116,Barney:,"I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club.
"
6,12,117,Ted from 2030:,"The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island.
"
6,12,118,Barney:,"Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless...
"
6,12,119,Sam:,"What's up, Barney?
"
6,12,120,Barney:,"I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.
"
6,12,121,Sam:,"Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney.
"
6,12,122,Barney:,"No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail.
"
6,12,123,Sam:,"What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe.
"
6,12,124,Barney:,"I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more.
"
6,12,125,Sam:,"Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews.
"
6,12,126,Barney:,"Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero...
"
6,12,127,Doctor:,"You're not pregnant.
"
6,12,128,Barney:,"..Zero... (Cell phone chimes) Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars.
"
6,12,129,Sam:,"That's great. Thank you, Barney!
"
6,12,130,Barney:,"Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me.
"
6,12,131,Ted:,"What happened to giving the money away?
"
6,12,132,Barney:,"Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born. (Chuckles) Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!
"
6,12,133,Ted:,"It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!
"
6,12,134,Barney:,"Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.
"
6,12,135,Ted:,"Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?
"
6,12,136,Ted from 2030:,"Let's back up one last time.
"
6,12,137,Lily:,"I'm pregnant.
"
6,12,138,Robin:,"What?!
"
6,12,139,Barney:,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!
"
6,12,140,Marshall:,"This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now.
"
6,12,141,Lily:,"I can. And I'm freaking out, too! There's an alien growing in my stomach that's gonna explode out of my v*g1n*!
"
6,12,142,Marshall:,"Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out?
"
6,12,143,Robin:,"What am I doing with my life?
"
6,12,144,Barney:,"What am I doing with my life?
"
6,12,145,Ted:,"I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.
"
6,12,146,Marshall:,"They're totally onto us. What do we do?
"
6,12,147,Lily:,"Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense!
"
6,12,148,Marshall:,"I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell.
"
6,12,149,Lily:,"Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.
"
6,12,150,Ted from 2030:,"Narrator: So Marshall and Lily headed home.
"
6,12,151,Marshall:,"Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight!
"
6,12,152,Lily:,"Let's do it! Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy.
"
6,12,153,Marshall:,"Nursery's painted!
"
6,12,154,Lily:,"Blue? What if it's a girl?
"
6,12,155,Marshall:,"Damn it!
"
6,12,156,Lily:,"Oh, God, it's 8:00! We're supposed to meet the gang at the bar to celebrate.
"
6,12,157,Marshall:,"Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. Can you keep it together?!
"
6,12,158,Lily:,"No, I can't keep it together!
"
6,12,159,Robin:,"I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.
"
6,12,160,Marshall:,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.
"
6,12,161,Marshall:,"This is a nightmare! We've done everything wrong!
"
6,12,162,Lily:,"The iPod was on shuffle! (Rock music stops) The Jerky Boys! Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!
"
6,12,163,Marshall:,"You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny.
"
6,12,164,Lily:,"The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful.
"
6,12,165,Marshall:,"You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips.
"
6,12,166,Lily:,"Marshall, I don't like this.
"
6,12,167,Marshall:,"I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away!
"
6,12,168,Doctor:,"You're not pregnant.
"
6,12,169,Marshall:,"Well, that did it.
"
6,12,170,Doctor:,"I know this probably comes as quite a disappointment.
"
6,12,171,Marshall:,"Yeah. Huge bummer.
"
6,12,172,Lily:,"So disappointing.
"
6,12,173,Ted:,"Are you guys okay?
"
6,12,174,Lily:,"Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing.
"
6,12,175,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice.
"
6,12,176,Lily:,"Don't reach into the living room!
"
6,12,177,Ted:,"Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated.
"
6,12,178,Marshall:,"Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there.
"
6,12,179,Lily:,"Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all.
"
6,12,180,Marshall:,"Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.
"
6,12,181,Barney:,"Get a puppy!
"
6,12,182,Marshall:,"Can you imagine... That would be the cutest thing!
"
6,12,183,"Ted, yelling:","No!
"
6,12,184,Barney:,"Oh. Our movie snack.
"
6,12,185,Ted:,"Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!
"
6,12,186,"Barney, singsongy:","Marshall and Lily got in trouble.
"
6,12,187,Ted:,"And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.
"
6,12,188,Barney:,"I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!
"
6,12,189,Ted:,"Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!
"
6,12,190,"Robin, stuttering:","So, if I get a large popcorn, you want to go split-skees or...
"
6,12,191,Ted:,"And you... You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo. So here's how it's gonna work: Heads, you take the job at World Wide News; Tails, you take the job at World Wide News. Ow! Hey, looks like somebody got a new gig!
"
6,12,192,Robin:,"Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now.
"
6,12,193,Ted:,"Hello.
"
6,12,194,Punchy:,"Ted, I can't get married!
"
6,12,195,Ted:,"Yes, you can! You love her!
"
6,12,196,Punchy:,"You're right, I do! Thanks, Ted!
"
6,12,197,Ted:,"One for It's a Wonderful Life, please. Thank you.
"
6,12,198,Marshall:,"We're idiots.
"
6,12,199,Lily:,"This kid doesn't stand a chance.
"
6,12,200,Marshall:,"We're ready for this.
"
6,12,201,Lily:,"We're ready for this.
"
6,12,202,Sam:,"Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point?
"
6,12,203,Barney:,"Nope.
"
6,12,204,Woman:,"And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon, you'll meet everyone there, but first you need to head down to security. You need to get your picture taken. For your I.D. badge.
"
6,12,205,Marshall:,"You sure?
"
6,12,206,Lily:,"Positive.
"
6,12,207,Barney:,"And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?
"
6,12,208,Sam:,"Yeah. Why?
"
6,12,209,Barney:,"Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas.
"
6,12,210,Sam:,"Thank you, son.
"
6,12,211,Barney:,"Son?!
"
6,12,212,Sam:,"It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad.
"
6,12,213,Ted:,"Congratulations.
"
6,12,214,Robin:,"You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path.
"
6,12,215,Ted:,"It's what I do.
"
6,12,216,Robin:,"Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying...
"
6,12,217,Ted:,"Big mistake, but go on.
"
6,12,218,Robin:,"..I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?
"
6,12,219,Ted:,"Are you asking what I think you're asking?
"
6,12,220,Robin:,"Ted, will you be my best man?
"
6,12,221,Ted:,"Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.
"
6,12,222,Barney:,"Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.
"
6,12,223,Woman:,"Um, no.
"
6,12,224,Barney:,"Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight...
"
6,6,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, our friends Stuart and Claudia had a baby, and Marshall and Lily were the first to visit the happy new parents.
"
6,6,2,Marshall:,"So, have you guys landed on a name yet?
"
6,6,3,Stuart:,"We're trying, but it's tougher than you think. You see, I like ""Tiffany.""
"
6,6,4,Claudia:,"And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.
"
6,6,5,Stuart:,"That's my mother's name.
"
6,6,6,Claudia:,"I know.
"
6,6,7,Stuart:,"Oh, I got it. How 'bout we name the baby after you-- ""Frigid Shrew.""
"
6,6,8,Claudia:,"Oh, that's good. No, no, no, no. Let's call her ""Vodka."" Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go!
"
6,6,9,Stuart:,"Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it.
"
6,6,10,Marshall:,"Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?
"
6,6,11,Lily:,"Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a...
"
6,6,12,Marshall:,"Emily.
"
6,6,13,Lily:,"Lisa.
"
6,6,14,Marshall:,"Lisa?!
"
6,6,15,Lily:,"Emily?!
"
6,6,16,Marshall:,"Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top: number one...
"
6,6,17,Ted:,"I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid ""LeBron,"" and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.
"
6,6,18,Marshall:,"Then I'm also crossing off, um, ""Shaquille""... Mm-hmm. ""Hakeem,"" and ""Dikembe."" Hey, what about ""Rob""?
"
6,6,19,Lily:,"""Rob""? No.
"
6,6,20,Marshall:,"Why not?
"
6,6,21,Lily:,"Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?
"
6,6,22,Rob:,"Honka, honka!
"
6,6,23,Lily:,"Not ""Rob.""
"
6,6,24,Marshall:,"um, how about ""Ryan""?
"
6,6,25,Ted:,"Ooh.
"
6,6,26,Lily:,"Not ""Ryan.""
"
6,6,27,Marshall:,"""Johnny?""
"
6,6,28,Lily:,"Hey, where's the goldfish?
"
6,6,29,Lily:,"Not ""Johnny."" Or ""Gil.""
"
6,6,30,Marshall:,"""Jeremy.""
"
6,6,31,Lily:,"Jeremy, no!
"
6,6,32,Lily:,"Definitely not ""Jeremy."" His stuff was so derivative.
"
6,6,33,Marshall:,"Well, I mean, geez, Lily.
"
6,6,34,Robin:,"Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby ""Becky,"" right?
"
6,6,35,Marshall:,"Why? What?
"
6,6,36,Robin:,"Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?
"
6,6,37,Lily:,"Oh, honey, I really try.
"
6,6,38,Marshall:,"Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.
"
6,6,39,Ted:,"I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how ""awful"" Becky is, so last night I checked it out.
"
6,6,40,Robin:,"Peace talks in the region have been described as, ""productive."" Becky?
"
6,6,41,Becky:,"(in baby voice): Last night, in Staten Island, a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint. Aww... That's so sad.
"
6,6,42,Robin:,"Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...
"
6,6,43,Becky:,"Oh, no! They stole all his money and then pelted him with his own taco meat! Who would do that?
"
6,6,44,Robin:,"Well, if you read the story, we might find out.
"
6,6,45,Becky:,"Oh, can I do this one, about the horse? I love horseys. Mm-hmm. Aww, the horse died. Guys! This news is all really sad.
"
6,6,46,Robin:,"Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?
"
6,6,47,Ted:,"Mmm... (muttering) I thought she was charming.
"
6,6,48,Robin:,"You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?
"
6,6,49,Barney:,"You want the long version or the short version?
"
6,6,50,Lily:,"Short version.
"
6,6,51,Barney:,"Short version. Who's your daddy?
"
6,6,52,Lily:,"You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy.
"
6,6,53,Marshall:,"No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?
"
6,6,54,Robin:,"Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.
"
6,6,55,Marshall:,"No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.
"
6,6,56,Ted:,"Wow. That is disgusting.
"
6,6,57,Robin:,"Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.
"
6,6,58,Barney:,"Challenge accepted.
"
6,6,59,Robin:,"No.
"
6,6,60,Barney:,"I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.
"
6,6,61,Lily:,"Okay. Here's my list of baby names.
"
6,6,62,Marshall:,"Oh.
"
6,6,63,Lily:,"What about ""Tara""?
"
6,6,64,Marshall:,"No. Not ""Tara."" Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her.
"
6,6,65,Marshall:,"We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her.
"
6,6,66,"Marshall and his friends, singing:","* Tara, your booty is so smooth; And I hope this isn't rude; But I want to get up on it. *
"
6,6,67,Marshall:,"Not ""Tara.""
"
6,6,68,Lily:,"What about ""Esther""?
"
6,6,69,Announcer:,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. Coming up on the main stage, give it up for Esther!
"
6,6,70,Marshall:,"Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance.
"
6,6,71,Barney:,"Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance.
"
6,6,72,Marshall:,"Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!
"
6,6,73,Barney:,"That was my card!
"
6,6,74,Announcer:,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. Give it up for Esther!
"
6,6,75,Marshall:,"Not ""Esther."" I need a drink. Ted? Ted?
"
6,6,76,Ted:,"Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?
"
6,6,77,Marshall:,"Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther -- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads?
"
6,6,78,(Marshall is visualizing high school boys singing a song for his daughter:,"
"
6,6,79,then in a club:,
6,6,80,Announcer:,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. On the main stage, give it up for Marshall's daughter.)
"
6,6,81,Marshall:,"I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God.
"
6,6,82,Marshall's daughter:,"Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend.
"
6,6,83,Barney:,"Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie. (weak laughter) Who's your daddy?
"
6,6,84,Marshall's daughter:,"ou are, 'cause of all the s*x we have.
"
6,6,85,Marshall:,"I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.
"
6,6,86,Ted:,"It's not what it sounds like, folks.
"
6,6,87,Marshall:,"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
"
6,6,88,Judy:,"Marshall? Is that you?
"
6,6,89,Marshall:,"h, okay, um... You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit?
"
6,6,90,Marvin:,"How's this?
"
6,6,91,Marshall:,"Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect.
"
6,6,92,Marvin:,"What's up, shooter?
"
6,6,93,Marshall:,"Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys.
"
6,6,94,Marvin:,"Oh, well, that was just dumb luck. Hey, honey, would you get me a brewski from out of the shed?
"
6,6,95,Judy:,"Sure. You want anything, Marshall?
"
6,6,96,Marshall:,"I'm in a computer, Mom.
"
6,6,97,Judy:,"Oh.
"
6,6,98,Marvin:,"Yeah, all boys. Total co-winky-dink. It was no co-winky-dink. Since the Viking age, the Eriksen men have passed down ancient secrets for conceiving boys. Number one, avoid lemons. They're baby girl fertilizer.
"
6,6,99,Marshall:,"Okay... No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's any scientific data to support--
"
6,6,100,Marvin:,"""I doubt there's any scientific data to support.."""" I had all sons. Your grandfather had all sons. Your great-grandfather had all sons. Scoreboard! Who you gonna listen to? Me? Or ""scientific data""?
"
6,6,101,Robin:,"Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?
"
6,6,102,Becky:,"Ask me what I did yesterday.
"
6,6,103,Robin:,"Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday.
"
6,6,104,Becky:,"Lighten up, Robin. (in baby voice): What'd you do, sweetheart?
"
6,6,105,Robin:,"Mike!
"
6,6,106,Becky:,"Well, I'm new in town and don't know many people. But yesterday, I met the sweetest man, who took me on a tour of the city. (whispering) Guys, New York is kind of cool.
"
6,6,107,Robin:,"Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic.
"
6,6,108,Becky:,"Then this cutie patootie took me to this bar called MacLaren's, right underneath his apartment.
"
6,6,109,Robin:,"ait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?
"
6,6,110,Becky:,"Yes! Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate. I saw her bedroom. (whispering) She's a messy Bessie.
"
6,6,111,Robin:,"n other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.
"
6,6,112,Ted:,"Ow!
"
6,6,113,Robin:,"Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?
"
6,6,114,Ted:,"Not what it sounds like, folks.
"
6,6,115,Robin:,"Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?
"
6,6,116,Ted:,"It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.
"
6,6,117,Becky:,"I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies. But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.
"
6,6,118,Ted:,"Aww...
"
6,6,119,Becky:,"(shrieks) A spider!
"
6,6,120,Robin:,"Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.
"
6,6,121,Ted:,"I don't know if that's totally true.
"
6,6,122,Ted:,"It's okay, little darlin'.
"
6,6,123,Becky:,"Poor spider.
"
6,6,124,Ted:,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.
"
6,6,125,Ted:,"Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.
"
6,6,126,Robin:,"Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?
"
6,6,127,Ted:,"(scoffing) Yeah, I slept.
"
6,6,128,Barney:,"I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.
"
6,6,129,Barney:,"(in childlike voice) Wow, lady. You got some tig ol' bitties! Gosh! Your body's a perfect... this many. (To another girl) Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!
"
6,6,130,Marshall:,"Mm, I just need two seconds, baby.
"
6,6,131,Lily:,"I know you think that's a compliment, but I'd rather you took your time.
"
6,6,132,Marshall:,"No, um... I'll be right back.
"
6,6,133,Marvin:,"Ancient Norse wisdom tells us that, to sire a son, you must do three things right before you lay with your maiden. First, eat pickled herring. Eat it!
"
6,6,134,Marshall:,"This is ridiculous. (He imagines his daughter, pregnant et in a wedding gown)
"
6,6,135,ANNOUNCER:,"Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage, throwing her life away, give it up for Marshall's daughter!
"
6,6,136,Barney:,"(little boy voice) Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend? His name's Otis. Hey, hey, want to come to my house and play telephone? I got the string; you got the cans. (giggles) I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited.
"
6,6,137,Robin:,"Yeah, we don't care about this...
"
6,6,138,Ted:,"No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.
"
6,6,139,Barney:,"(whispers) I'm sorry.
"
6,6,140,Man:,"Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing.
"
6,6,141,Barney:,"Challenge accept...
"
6,6,142,Ted:,"Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.
"
6,6,143,Robin:,"Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.
"
6,6,144,Ted:,"For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.
"
6,6,145,Robin:,"Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed.
"
6,6,146,Ted:,"Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.
"
6,6,147,Marvin:,"Son... Viking lore tells us that to ensure the continuation of your noble male lineage... get a big old bowl of ice and dunk your man sack right in there!
"
6,6,148,Judy:,"You two and your football.
"
6,6,149,Marshall:,"Okay. (He dunks your man sack in a big old bowl of ice) Mm-hmm.
"
6,6,150,Marvin:,"Now get in there, point Lily due north and make me a grandson! Eriksen!
"
6,6,151,Marshall:,"Eriksen!
"
6,6,152,Robin:,"When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?
"
6,6,153,Ted:,"Come on! You always took charge of everything.
"
6,6,154,Robin:,"I got this.
"
6,6,155,Ted:,"Thanks.
"
6,6,156,Ted:,"This okay? Am I hurting y...
"
6,6,157,Robin:,"I got this. Whoa!
"
6,6,158,Ted:,"Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.
"
6,6,159,Robin:,"I got this.
"
6,6,160,Robin:,"Did that really bother you?
"
6,6,161,Ted:,"Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (phone chimes) I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.
"
6,6,162,Robin:,"I got this.
"
6,6,163,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
6,6,164,Marshall:,"(goofy voice) Let's make a baby!
"
6,6,165,Lily:,"Whoa! Baby, you're packing snowballs, and your breath smells like a mermaid fart.
"
6,6,166,Marshall:,"Loving the dirty talk-- but you know what's even hotter? If we face this-a-way. Ooh, we're bad.
"
6,6,167,Lily:,"Wait... hey, baby, why are you facing me north? You're trying to make us have a boy.
"
6,6,168,Marshall:,"I... can ex... How do you know about the north thing? Um, um... And what are you doing with those lemons?
"
6,6,169,Marvin:,"Baby girl fertilizer!
"
6,6,170,Marshall:,"You're trying to make us have a girl! You are trying to make us have a girl.
"
6,6,171,Lily:,"All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled ""how to make a girl some really weird stuff came up but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception... eat a lemon......and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees. (blow-dryer whooshing) Ooh... ah... Oh, that's not bad.
"
6,6,172,Marshall:,"Lily, how could you do... exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one.
"
6,6,173,Lily:,"See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys.
"
6,6,174,Marshall:,"Oh, really. Well, then how come whenever there's a creepy kid in a horror movie it's always a little girl? Or twin girls, who speak... (eerily): in unison.
"
6,6,175,Lily:,"Oh, well, what about Chucky?
"
6,6,176,Marshall:,"Okay, A) He was a doll; B) He was possessed by an adult serial killer; and C) How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?
"
6,6,177,Robin:,"Hey.
"
6,6,178,Barney:,"Hey.
"
6,6,179,Robin:,"Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?
"
6,6,180,Barney:,"No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all.
"
6,6,181,Robin:,"That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.
"
6,6,182,Barney:,"Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say ""Who's your daddy?"" to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.
"
6,6,183,Robin:,"Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?
"
6,6,184,Woman:,"(baby voice) Someone naughty left his toys on the floor and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.
"
6,6,185,Barney:,"(baby voice): Uh-oh, I'm in ""twubble.""
"
6,6,186,Woman:,"You did it? How?
"
6,6,187,Barney:,"Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go.
"
6,6,188,Woman:,"Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some?
"
6,6,189,Barney:,"No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.
"
6,6,190,Woman:,"baby voice) Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy?
"
6,6,191,Barney:,"Challenge completed! (chuckles) Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.
"
6,6,192,Robin:,"I got this.
"
6,6,193,Lily:,"Oh, so you finally agreed on a name?
"
6,6,194,Claudia:,"Uh, well,vthe other night she ran a really high fever.
"
6,6,195,Stuart:,"We rushed her to the emergency room at 3:00 in the morning, but they wouldn't admit her without a name. Right then and there, we realized how stupid we were being.
"
6,6,196,Claudia:,"We looked at each other and, well, we just knew. Our baby's name is... Esther.
"
6,6,197,Marshall:,"Esther? That's beautiful.
"
6,6,198,Lily:,"We're idiots.
"
6,6,199,Marshall:,"Baby, names and gender, it's just, like... it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound--
"
6,6,200,Lily:,"Whoa.
"
6,6,201,Marshall:,"Ten-pound? Eight-pound?
"
6,6,202,Lily:,"I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my v*g1n* can't cash.
"
6,6,203,Marshall:,"I love you. And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have.
"
6,6,204,Lily:,"Me, too.
"
6,6,205,Marshall:,"You know what? We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy. Like, um...
"
6,6,206,Marshall & Lily:,"Jamie.
"
6,6,207,Lily:,"Marshall... we just named our baby. Jamie.
"
6,6,208,Lily:,"Not Jamie.
"
6,6,209,Ted:,"Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over.
"
6,10,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving. And I wanted it to be unforgettable.
"
6,10,2,Ted:,"Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!
"
6,10,3,Lily:,"A Turturkeykey?
"
6,10,4,Robin:,"Yeah, I was there for the ""insertion."" He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.
"
6,10,5,Ted:,"Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.
"
6,10,6,Barney:,"What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?
"
6,10,7,Marshall:,"Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz.
"
6,10,8,Ted from 2030:,"Blitz was a guy we knew in college. Sadly, he was cursed.
"
6,10,9,Blitz:,"Well... I'm calling it a little early.
"
6,10,10,Ted:,"Wh... you sure? We got big plans.
"
6,10,11,Marshall:,"Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz?
"
6,10,12,Ted:,"Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.
"
6,10,13,Marshall:,"We'll see what happens.
"
6,10,14,Blitz:,"Nah, it's Kraft/Croft night: mac and cheese and Tomb Raider. Biz-zow!
"
6,10,15,Ted from 2030:,"You see, every time Blitz left a place, something amazing happened.
"
6,10,16,Woman:,"Oh! I'm sorry. I thought this was my room.
"
6,10,17,Ted:,"Completely naked!
"
6,10,18,Marshall:,"Completely naked!
"
6,10,19,Blitz:,"Aw, man!
"
6,10,20,Marshall:,"And the movie was awesome.
"
6,10,21,Blitz:,"Aw, man!
"
6,10,22,Ted:,"At the exact moment Brando first appeared, ""Weird Al"" launched right into ""Eat It.""
"
6,10,23,Blitz:,"Aw, man!
"
6,10,24,Ted from 2030:,"And over the years, ""The Curse of The Blitz"" continued.
"
6,10,25,Blitz:,"Well, I'm gonna call it. I just got Madden 2K1, and I can't stop thinking about it.
"
6,10,26,Bar Tender:,"Tap's broke! Can't turn 'em off! Free beer for everyone!
"
6,10,27,Ted:,"Free beer for everyone!
"
6,10,28,Marshall:,"Free beer for everyone!
"
6,10,29,Blitz:,"Aw, man!
"
6,10,30,Marshall:,"You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become... The Blitz.
"
6,10,31,Ted:,"All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe ""The Curse of The Blitz"" is real. (gasps)
"
6,10,32,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, I'd live to regret those words. You see, the ""Curse of Blitz"" could be passed from one person to the next, at any moment. Blitz had gotten the curse from Jerry Windheim, back in freshman year, who got it years before that from Davey Beaterman. The original Blitz, Matt Blitz, was a guy who went to Wesleyan back in the '60s. He dropped out right before the school went co-ed. And then, Thanksgiving morning...
"
6,10,33,Ted:,"What the hell happened here?
"
6,10,34,Robin:,"Hey! Morning, Blitz!
"
6,10,35,Ted:,"Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.
"
6,10,36,"Barney, singing:","My Blitzy lies over the ocean; My Blitzy lies over the sea; My Blitzy lies over the ocean; So bring back my Blitzy...
"
6,10,37,Ted:,"Please stop. Okay, fine.
"
6,10,38,Barney:,"..To me.
"
6,10,39,Lily:,"The Gentleman!
"
6,10,40,Everyone:,"The Gentleman!
"
6,10,41,Ted:,"Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's ""The Gentleman""?
"
6,10,42,Lily:,"Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.
"
6,10,43,Ted:,"I'm not The Blitz! (Ted goes into the bathroom, he hears a person yawning and opens the bath curtain) Zoey?
"
6,10,44,Zoey:,"Morning, Blitz!
"
6,10,45,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, you remember Zoey. For the last two months, she'd been making my life hell.
"
6,10,46,Zoey:,"Thanks, guys! Last night was amazing! The Gentleman!
"
6,10,47,Everyone:,"The Gentle...
"
6,10,48,Ted:,"How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!
"
6,10,49,Lily:,"Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...
"
6,10,50,Ted:,"'m not The Blitz!
"
6,10,51,Lily:,"Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.
"
6,10,52,Lily:,"Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!
"
6,10,53,Ted:,"Finish the story, Red.
"
6,10,54,Lily:,"Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.
"
6,10,55,Barney:,"And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.
"
6,10,56,Marshall:,"Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.
"
6,10,57,Barney:,"Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?
"
6,10,58,Lily:,"Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it.
"
6,10,59,Zoey:,"Can I... help you?
"
6,10,60,Lily:,"Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better...
"
6,10,61,Zoey:,"You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!
"
6,10,62,Lily:,"Well, yeah.
"
6,10,63,Zoey:,"You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online.
"
6,10,64,Lily:,"(gasps) That was you?!
"
6,10,65,Zoey:,"Yeah.
"
6,10,66,Lily:,"Oh! Thanks!
"
6,10,67,Robin:,"Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her.
"
6,10,68,Everyone:,"The Gentleman! (whooping, applause)
"
6,10,69,Lily:,"And then, the craziest thing happened.
"
6,10,70,Ted:,"I missed a skateboarding dog?
"
6,10,71,Lily:,"Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.
"
6,10,72,Ted:,"It wasn't?
"
6,10,73,Zoey:,"Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare?
"
6,10,74,Marshall:,"Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare.
"
6,10,75,Zoey:,"Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger.
"
6,10,76,Marshall:,"Best idea ever!
"
6,10,77,Marshall:,"Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.
"
6,10,78,Zoey:,"Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers.
"
6,10,79,Blitz:,"4, 8... 15, 16, 23, 42!
"
6,10,80,Zoey:,"And... send!
"
6,10,81,Ted:,"Wait. Blitz was there, too?
"
6,10,82,Blitz:,"The Gentleman!
"
6,10,83,Everyone:,"The Gentleman!
"
6,10,84,Blitz:,"Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said ""Grand Theft Auto"" can wait a night.
"
6,10,85,Barney:,"It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!
"
6,10,86,Ted:,"I'm not The Blitz!
"
6,10,87,Marshall:,"I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory.
"
6,10,88,Mysterious voice:,"Blitz...
"
6,10,89,Blitz:,"I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea what I've missed all these years: The university president's toupee being snatched by a hawk at graduation, Zeppelin reuniting at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah, countless nip-slips, crotch shots, shooting stars and double rainbows. I've missed them all!
"
6,10,90,Barney:,"Well, not anymore, Blitz.
"
6,10,91,Blitz:,"My name's not Blitz. My name is Steve! Colors seem so bright now. Thank you, Blitz.
"
6,10,92,Ted:,"What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!
"
6,10,93,Lily:,"I tried.
"
6,10,94,Ted:,"Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Renée Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!
"
6,10,95,Lily:,"Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!
"
6,10,96,Ted:,"That's Kate Hudson!
"
6,10,97,Lily:,"Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.
"
6,10,98,Ted:,"No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen? (all murmuring) Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven.
"
6,10,99,Robin:,"The oven.
"
6,10,100,Barney:,"Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.
"
6,10,101,"Everyone, chanting:","Make out with Zoey! Make out with Zoey! Make out...
"
6,10,102,Steve:,"Did they tell you about the skateboarding dog? It was awesome!
"
6,10,103,Ted:,"Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?
"
6,10,104,Barney:,"Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.
"
6,10,105,Lily:,"But if it helps, I reached 4G.
"
6,10,106,Ted:,"It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?
"
6,10,107,Steve:,"This is awesome! I'm part of this!
"
6,10,108,Ted:,"Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.
"
6,10,109,Barney:,"Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.
"
6,10,110,Marshall:,"Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny explosion at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.
"
6,10,111,Steve:,"This is awesome!
"
6,10,112,Ted:,"It's not awesome!
"
6,10,113,Robin:,"I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.
"
6,10,114,Barney:,"Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!
"
6,10,115,Steve:,"Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger.
"
6,10,116,Lily:,"Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.
"
6,10,117,Zoey:,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway.
"
6,10,118,Lily:,"Could we bring Ted?
"
6,10,119,Zoey:,"It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?
"
6,10,120,Ted:,"No. Absolutely not.
"
6,10,121,Lily:,"Come on. Give her a chance.
"
6,10,122,Robin:,"Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.
"
6,10,123,Marshall:,"Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?
"
6,10,124,Barney:,"And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.
"
6,10,125,Babaka:,"But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?
"
6,10,126,Barney:,"No. I c... Because... Step on it.
"
6,10,127,Marshall:,"You missed it.
"
6,10,128,Steve:,"Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!
"
6,10,129,Robin:,"Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang ""Twist and Shout!""
"
6,10,130,Barney:,"But he's The Blitz.
"
6,10,131,Ted:,"No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.
"
6,10,132,Mysterious voice:,"Blitz...
"
6,10,133,Barney:,"Oh, God, no!
"
6,10,134,Marshall:,"Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.
"
6,10,135,Ted:,"Chicka-chicka!
"
6,10,136,Zoey:,"Happy Thanksgiving! Ted.
"
6,10,137,Ted:,"Zoey.
"
6,10,138,Lily:,"Best friend alert!
"
6,10,139,Ted:,"Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.
"
6,10,140,Marshall:,"Oh, God, that is disgusting!
"
6,10,141,Ted:,"Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.
"
6,10,142,Marshall:,"No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.
"
6,10,143,Robin:,"Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.
"
6,10,144,Lily:,"It's a boom-a-wang.
"
6,10,145,Robin:,"Nice.
"
6,10,146,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
6,10,147,Robin:,"No, I meant the wang.
"
6,10,148,Zoey:,"Barney, could you get me some more ice?
"
6,10,149,Barney:,"Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. (whispering): I'm scared.
"
6,10,150,Steve:,"You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.
"
6,10,151,Barney:,"Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.
"
6,10,152,Steve:,"Okay, I got to test this.
"
6,10,153,Barney:,"What happened?
"
6,10,154,Lily:,"You missed it!
"
6,10,155,Marshall:,"Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.
"
6,10,156,Barney:,"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!
"
6,10,157,Steve:,"I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.
"
6,10,158,Barney:,"No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.
"
6,10,159,Marshall:,"Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.
"
6,10,160,Zoey:,"Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.
"
6,10,161,Ted:,"Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.
"
6,10,162,Steve:,"Facial!
"
6,10,163,Ted:,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.
"
6,10,164,Zoey:,"I'm coming with you.
"
6,10,165,Ted:,"No... I baste alone.
"
6,10,166,Zoey:,"Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.
"
6,10,167,Steve:,"Word play. Loving it.
"
6,10,168,Zoey:,"But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through.
"
6,10,169,Ted:,"Who canceled? Your coven?
"
6,10,170,Steve:,"Coven. Group of witches.
"
6,10,171,Zoey:,"Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair.
"
6,10,172,Steve:,"Oh! Serve returned.
"
6,10,173,Ted:,"Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.
"
6,10,174,Zoey:,"Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.
"
6,10,175,Steve:,"God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling.
"
6,10,176,Ted:,"Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.
"
6,10,177,Lily:,"Ted, give her a chance.
"
6,10,178,Ted:,"Enemies can't become friends.
"
6,10,179,Zoey:,"Yes, they can. Right, guys?
"
6,10,180,Ted:,"No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.
"
6,10,181,Robin:,"Well, let's get an outside opinion.
"
6,10,182,Ted:,"Who are we gonna...
"
6,10,183,Robin:,"""Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.""
"
6,10,184,Ted:,"Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?
"
6,10,185,Robin:,"He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...
"
6,10,186,Lily:,"Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?
"
6,10,187,Robin:,"What? No. Shut up. I hate him.
"
6,10,188,Marshall:,"Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. ""Yes, enemies can become friends. ""Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'""
"
6,10,189,Steve:,"Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?
"
6,10,190,"Barney, laughing:","That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha! (weak laugh) Burn on her.
"
6,10,191,Steve:,"Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.
"
6,10,192,Barney:,"I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!
"
6,10,193,Robin:,"What does that have to do with anything?
"
6,10,194,Barney:,"Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!
"
6,10,195,Ted:,"Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.
"
6,10,196,Ted:,"Oh, my God!
"
6,10,197,Zoey:,"Did you do that on purpose?
"
6,10,198,Ted:,"What? No. It was an accident.
"
6,10,199,Zoey:,"Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.
"
6,10,200,Ted:,"Oh, great. Real mature.
"
6,10,201,Zoey:,"Yeah, well, you started it.
"
6,10,202,Lily:,"Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.
"
6,10,203,Ted:,"Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!
"
6,10,204,Zoey:,"Oh, get out. All of you, out!
"
6,10,205,Lily:,"But it's Thanksgiving.
"
6,10,206,Steve:,"And I'm a part of it.
"
6,10,207,Zoey:,"Out!
"
6,10,208,Marshall:,"Wait... Where's Barney?
"
6,10,209,Barney:,"Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.
"
6,10,210,Lily:,"I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?
"
6,10,211,Ted from 2030:,"And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear.
"
6,10,212,Driver:,"Where to?
"
6,10,213,Ted:,"I guess we're going home.
"
6,10,214,Driver:,"Yeah. I don't know where that is.
"
6,10,215,Ted:,"Lily, where'd you get that?
"
6,10,216,Lily:,"Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? ""Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey."" I wonder who Hannah is.
"
6,10,217,Zoey:,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.
"
6,10,218,Ted:,"And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!
"
6,10,219,Zoey:,"Get out! All of you, out!
"
6,10,220,Ted:,"We have to go back to Zoey's.
"
6,10,221,Driver:,"You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.
"
6,10,222,Zoey:,"Oh, God. What are you doing here?
"
6,10,223,Ted:,"Barney let us in.
"
6,10,224,Zoey:,"Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.
"
6,10,225,Barney:,"Aw, man! Wait. Which half?
"
6,10,226,Ted:,"Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.
"
6,10,227,Zoey:,"How do you know that?
"
6,10,228,Ted:,"I just do. It must be tough.
"
6,10,229,Zoey:,"It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts.
"
6,10,230,Ted:,"I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.
"
6,10,231,Zoey:,"Yeah... Right. Next year.
"
6,10,232,Ted:,"Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.
"
6,10,233,Ted from 2030:,"And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends.
"
6,10,234,Everyone:,"Cheers.
"
6,10,235,Zoey:,"Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.
"
6,10,236,Marshall:,"Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.
"
6,10,237,Zoey:,"Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen.
"
6,10,238,Ted:,"Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.
"
6,10,239,Ted from 2030:,"It didn't. It tasted wrong.
"
6,10,240,Steve:,"Oops. We forgot to light the candles.
"
6,10,241,Ted from 2030:,"And just as Barney looked away, it happened.
"
6,10,242,Everyone:,"The Gentleman!
"
6,10,243,Barney:,"What happened? I saw it!
"
6,10,244,Steve:,"Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.
"
6,10,245,Woman:,"Oh, hold the door!
"
6,10,246,Barney:,"Thank you, God!
"
6,10,247,Mysterious voice:,"Blitz.
"
6,4,1,Barney:,"I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.
"
6,4,2,Ted:,"Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.
"
6,4,3,Barney:,"No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.
"
6,4,4,Lily:,"Aw... That's actually really sweet.
"
6,4,5,Barney:,"Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?
"
6,4,6,Everyone:,"Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!
"
6,4,7,Lily:,"That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.
"
6,4,8,Marsall:,"Hey, get this. You know my friend Max from law school? He's at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown, and Woody Allen is sitting two tables over. He wants us to come check it out.
"
6,4,9,Robin:,"I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.
"
6,4,10,Marsall:,"What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker and never have seen Woody Allen?
"
6,4,11,Robin:,"I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.
"
6,4,12,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, you know talk show host Maury Povich. It was uncanny how often we saw this guy.
"
6,4,13,Lily:,"Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.
"
6,4,14,Marsall:,"Maury Povich is everywhere. I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker until you've seen Woody Allen.
"
6,4,15,Robin:,"I am, too, a real New Yorker.
"
6,4,16,Ted:,"That's adorable. You're from Canada.
"
6,4,17,Robin:,"I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.
"
6,4,18,Lily:,"A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it.
"
6,4,19,Ted:,"I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.
"
6,4,20,Lily:,"No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks.
"
6,4,21,Marshall:,"No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've killed a cockroach with your bare hands.
"
6,4,22,Robin:,"Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things.
"
6,4,23,Ted from 2030:,"By the end of this day, Robin would have done all of those things.
"
6,4,24,Barney:,"Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?
"
6,4,25,Marshall:,"Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.
"
6,4,26,Barney:,"Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.
"
6,4,27,Robin:,"Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes.
"
6,4,28,Lily:,"A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three.
"
6,4,29,Ted:,"Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.
"
6,4,30,Barney:,"The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus.
"
6,4,31,Ted:,"Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't beat the bus!
"
6,4,32,Marshall:,"I can beat a bus or a cab or a train!
"
6,4,33,Robin:,"Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?
"
6,4,34,Marshall:,"Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.
"
6,4,35,Barney:,"You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first.
"
6,4,36,Marshall:,"How?
"
6,4,37,Barney:,"Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?
"
6,4,38,Lily:,"Oh, my God!
"
6,4,39,Barney:,"Oh, wow!
"
6,4,40,Ted:,"All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! (Everyone stand up et run outside)Doesn't matter how you get there!
"
6,4,41,Barney:,"(to the sad girl at the bar) Stay sad! I'll be back!
"
6,4,42,Barney:,"Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush.
"
6,4,43,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, I should tell you, Lily really needed a win that day.
"
6,4,44,Ted from 2030:,"When Marshall and Lily decided to have a baby, they assumed it would happen right away.
"
6,4,45,Marshall:,"It's gonna be positive. Eriksen man are hella fertile. When Uncle Morris was 16, he got his girlfriend pregnant just by holding her hand too tight in the backseat of a car. Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me.
"
6,4,46,Lily:,"Negative.
"
6,4,47,Ted from 2030:,"As the weeks went by, Marshall's confidence never wavered. Then it started to mess with Lily's head.
"
6,4,48,Marshall:,"Negative? Well, we know it's not me.
"
6,4,49,Lily:,"Everything's fine. These things take time.
"
6,4,50,Marshall:,"Not with an Eriksen. Something must be wrong with you. Also, my mom hates you.
"
6,4,51,Lily:,"You know what? Just to make sure, I'm gonna pee on this again.
"
6,4,52,Marshall:,"What? No, you wouldn't. Somebody help me! Somebody help me!
"
6,4,53,Ted from 2030:,"Lily was so fed up with not getting anywhere, maybe winning this race was just what she needed.
"
6,4,54,Man:,"Idiot!
"
6,4,55,Marshall:,"I'll show them. My body can outrun any motorized vehicle. I'm like John Henry when he beat the steam engine. All I need is a great folk song.
"
6,4,56,Folk singer:,"*Gather round, ye children to hear the tale so sweet of a man who dared to race machines with nothing but his feet*
"
6,4,57,Marshall:,"Suck it, grand-butt!
"
6,4,58,Folk singer:,"* Marshall versus the machines *
"
6,4,59,Robin:,"Ooh, taxi!
"
6,4,60,Man:,"Excuse me, I got a thing.
"
6,4,61,Speaker:,"Maury... Maury...
"
6,4,62,Lily:,"Track maintenance? 20-minute delay?
"
6,4,63,Man:," How do you do that?
"
6,4,64,Lily:,"I grew up here, I speak conductor. Damn it! (she gets off the train) Damn it!
"
6,4,65,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, I also needed a win that day. A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called...
"
6,4,66,Ted from 2030:,"A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called...
"
6,4,67,Ted:,"Grademyteacher.net?
"
6,4,68,Marshall:,"It's this awesome site where students can go say what they really think about their professors. Hey, you're probably on there.
"
6,4,69,Ted from 2030:,"I just had to see what my students had written about me. And it was... Majestic. Until...
"
6,4,70,Ted from 2030:,"Now, kids, I knew I was a good Professor. That's why I didn't let it bother me. I had nothing to prove. Absolutely nothing.
"
6,4,71,Ted:,"Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there?
"
6,4,72,Man:,"Oh. The brown one or the gray one?
"
6,4,73,Ted:,"That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18...
"
6,4,74,Barney:,"Hey! Come on! Elizabeth!
"
6,4,75,Waiter:,"Somebody call an ambulance!
"
6,4,76,Robin:,"Excuse me, I've got a thing.
"
6,4,77,Woman:,"Hey! That's my cab!
"
6,4,78,Robin:,"Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.
"
6,4,79,Woman:,"(jumping onto the cab)This is my cab...!
"
6,4,80,Barney:,"Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz.
"
6,4,81,Medic:,"Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown.
"
6,4,82,Barney:,"Oh, no. (He makes a phone call) It's Barney. Help me.
"
6,4,83,Ted from 2030:,"Robin also needed a win that day.
"
6,4,84,Ted from 2030:,"It had been a rough year for Robin. First her boyfriend and former cohost, Don, left her for another job. Then Robin met her new cohost, Becky.
"
6,4,85,Becky:,"Hi! I'm Becky!
"
6,4,86,Robin:,"Hi.
"
6,4,87,Becky:,"I am so excited to be your coanchor! Yay!
"
6,4,88,Robin:,"Hi, Becky. My, you're perky.
"
6,4,89,Becky:,"Don't worry, I am not here to step on your toesies.
"
6,4,90,Robin:,"Oh...
"
6,4,91,Becky:,"You're still the star. I made chocolate chip cookies for everybody! Yay!
"
6,4,92,Ted from 2030:,"And just like that, Becky started to eclipse Robin. I mean, literally eclipse her.
"
6,4,93,Woman:,"This is my cab! Aah!
"
6,4,94,Robin:,"Keep it.
"
6,4,95,Ranjit:,"Hello.
"
6,4,96,Barney:,"Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.
"
6,4,97,Ranjit:,"Taking you to Gregor's.
"
6,4,98,Folk singer:,"* As Marshall ran with all his might and passed his friend Christine *
"
6,4,99,Marshall:,"Hey, Christine.
"
6,4,100,Folk singer:,"* He thought of all the times that he had beaten the machine. He triumphed over ""Pitfall"" He vanquished the alarm. He brought the jukebox back to life with his Fonzarelli arm Marshall versus the machines. *
"
6,4,101,Woman:,"Last seat. Thank God. I just had the worst cab ride of my life.
"
6,4,102,Ted:,"Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. (the woman stands up to find another place)
"
6,4,103,Barney:,"Hey, Ranjit, pull over.
"
6,4,104,Ranjit:,"Pulling over.
"
6,4,105,Barney:,"Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.
"
6,4,106,Folk singer:,"* Hyah! Move along. Hyah! Move along. Hyah! *
"
6,4,107,Ted:,"See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be... (the driver suddenly pulls the breaks)
"
6,4,108,Robin:,"So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?
"
6,4,109,Barney:,"I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?
"
6,4,110,Robin:,"Are you kidding me?
"
6,4,111,Robin:,"Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?
"
6,4,112,Barney:,"Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.
"
6,4,113,Robin:,"Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing...
"
6,4,114,Barney:,"Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say ""carrots and peas"". Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.
"
6,4,115,Barney:,"What, you really had something to talk about?
"
6,4,116,Robin:,"Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me killed. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.
"
6,4,117,Barney:,"Robin, I had no idea.
"
6,4,118,Robin:,"No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car.
"
6,4,119,Ranjit:,"Stopping the car.
"
6,4,120,Barney:,"No, don't stop the car.
"
6,4,121,Ranjit:,"Not stopping the car.
"
6,4,122,Robin:,"Seriously, stop the car.
"
6,4,123,Ranjit:,"Seriously stopping the car.
"
6,4,124,Barney:,"Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here.
"
6,4,125,Robin:,"Carrots and peas.
"
6,4,126,Barney:,"Don't... You...
"
6,4,127,Ranjit:,"I'll crank up the smooth jazz.
"
6,4,128,Folk singer:,"* Our hero's strength was fading fast just as the light turned... green. He then thought back to all the times he'd lost to a machine. The cable box is fearsome but the stapler's mighty sting... The cable box's bite again... Getting too tired to sing. *
"
6,4,129,Ted:,"Uses a hybrid steel tube structure...
"
6,4,130,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, that day, I had a horrible realization. If you can't spot the crazy person on the bus...It's you. (Ted steps out of the bus) The good news is, I was halfway there, and nothing could stop me.
"
6,4,131,Marshall:,"Whoa! This is crazy.
"
6,4,132,Robin:,"I can't believe it.
"
6,4,133,Ted:,"Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar.
"
6,4,134,Ted from 2030:,"Just like that, the race was back on.
"
6,4,135,Maury Povich:,"Idiot.
"
6,4,136,Ted from 2030:,"Meanwhile, one subway car over...
"
6,4,137,Robin:,"Oh, God. Oh, bite me!
"
6,4,138,Barney:,"Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.
"
6,4,139,Barney:,"And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.
"
6,4,140,Ted from 2030:,"Actually, Barney did not need a win.
"
6,4,141,Barney:,"And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me.
"
6,4,142,Ted from 2030:,"e did smell incredible.
"
6,4,143,Barney:,"Stop! Too slow. Switch.
"
6,4,144,Lily:,"Sweetie? Are you okay?
"
6,4,145,Robin:,"No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over.
"
6,4,146,Lily:,"You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in.
"
6,4,147,Robin:,"What did he say?
"
6,4,148,Lily:,"No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich?
"
6,4,149,Robin:,"Hey! Lily.
"
6,4,150,Lily:,"Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker. (the doors of the train opens) Damn it. (she makes a phone call) Hey, it's Lily. Help me.
"
6,4,151,Ted:,"And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep?
"
6,4,152,"Man, in a calculator display:","Buddy? Hey, buddy? Need a hand?
"
6,4,153,Marshall:,"The machines have won! he machines have won.
"
6,4,154,Man:,"Dude, mellow.
"
6,4,155,Marshall:,"I can't do it. I can't run that far. I can't outrace anything. I... I can't... I can't get my wife pregnant!
"
6,4,156,Ted:,"Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?
"
6,4,157,Marshall:,"My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't.
"
6,4,158,Ted:,"Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.
"
6,4,159,Marshall:,"Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones.
"
6,4,160,Ted:,"64. But whatever.
"
6,4,161,Marshall:,"And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude.
"
6,4,162,Man:,"Sounds like you guys need to clear everything, subtract the negativity, and add some perspective.
"
6,4,163,Lily:,"Marshall! Marshall, get in!
"
6,4,164,Ranjit:,"Hello.
"
6,4,165,Ted:,"There it is.
"
6,4,166,Robin:,"Where are Marshall and lily?
"
6,4,167,Barney:,"Who cares?
"
6,4,168,Robin:,"I won? I won!
"
6,4,169,Barney:,"No!
"
6,4,170,Robin:,"I can't believe I won!
"
6,4,171,Barney:,"How did that even happen?
"
6,4,172,Ted from 2030:,"Here's how it happened.
"
6,4,173,Lily:,"Okay, he's in. Go. Go. Gun it.
"
6,4,174,Ranjit:,"Ted is in the way.
"
6,4,175,Lily:,"Run him over.
"
6,4,176,Ranjit:,"Running him over.
"
6,4,177,Marshall:,"No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?
"
6,4,178,Lily:,"Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me.
"
6,4,179,Marshall:,"Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.
"
6,4,180,Lily:,"Why did I get so crazy about this?
"
6,4,181,Marshall:,"Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.
"
6,4,182,Lily:,"Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.
"
6,4,183,Marshall:,"I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.
"
6,4,184,Lily:,"It's only been two months.
"
6,4,185,Marshall:,"We are crazy.
"
6,4,186,Lily:,"We're totally crazy.
"
6,4,187,Marshall:,"This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that?
"
6,4,188,Lily:,"We gotta go back to Paris.
"
6,4,189,Marshall:,"And take ballroom dancing.
"
6,4,190,Lily:,"And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge.
"
6,4,191,Marshall:,"And see Coney Island. I've still never been. See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do before we start having kids.
"
6,4,192,Lily:,"Oh, a cradle list.
"
6,4,193,Marshall:,"I'm... So glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited for when it happens, but this isn't a race.
"
6,4,194,Lily:,"It isn't a race.
"
6,4,195,Marshall:,"Ranjit, screw Gregor's. Let's go to Coney Island.
"
6,4,196,Ranjit:,"Screwing Gregor's. Going to Coney Island.
"
6,4,197,Ted from 2030:,"As for how Robin beat me and Barney, to this day, your uncle Barney won't admit it... Who cares? But here's what I saw: I saw Barney notice Robin's face... And maybe realize something. Barney says he tripped, but it sure felt like he tackled me on purpose. And when Robin won, I could have sworn I saw him smile.
"
6,4,198,Robin:,"I won!
"
6,4,199,Barney:,"No!
"
6,4,200,Robin:,"So I said, ""the cab, of course""
"
6,4,201,Ted:,"I know what you did back there.
"
6,4,202,Barney:,"Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.
"
6,4,203,Ted:,"I'm not gonna... Not gonna...
"
6,4,204,Barney:,"Smell me.
"
6,4,205,Ted from 2030:,"He did smell incredible.
"
6,4,206,Robin:,"Wait a minute. So, where is Woody Allen?
"
6,4,207,Max:,"He's right there.
"
6,4,208,Robin:,"Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.
"
6,4,209,Max:,"I always get those two confused.
"
6,4,210,Ted from 2030:,"Technically, there was only one winner that day. And in that race, everyone found exactly what they needed. It's true, she wouldn't see Woody Allen for another couple months, but that's how Robin became, by just about any definition of the term... A real New Yorker.
"
6,5,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, which meant working side by side with your Uncle Barney.
"
6,5,2,Ted:,"I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.
"
6,5,3,Barney:,"Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!
"
6,5,4,Ted from 2030:,"Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said...
"
6,5,5,Barney:,"Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building.
"
6,5,6,Ted from 2030:,"It was the site of The Arcadian, one of New York's grandest old hotels. In its heyday, it was the New York home to kings and queens. But lately... mostly just queens.
"
6,5,7,Transvestite:,"Hi, handsome. Lookin' for a date?
"
6,5,8,Ted:,"Uh, no, thank you. Still got it.
"
6,5,9,Ted:,"Barney, we have to talk.
"
6,5,10,Barney:,"Sure. What's up?
"
6,5,11,Barney's Secretary:,"Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.
"
6,5,12,Barney:,"Not now, Trish!
"
6,5,13,Barney's Secretary:,"But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby.
"
6,5,14,Ted:,"""Dary.""
"
6,5,15,Barney:,"Legendary! So, what's on your mind?
"
6,5,16,Ted:,"I can't design the building.
"
6,5,17,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah.
"
6,5,18,Lily:,"Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube.
"
6,5,19,Marshall:,"Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction.
"
6,5,20,Lily:,"Traction?
"
6,5,21,Marshall:,"As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm.
"
6,5,22,Lily:,"Please stop calling yourself ""Papa.""
"
6,5,23,Marshall:,"And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats.
"
6,5,24,Lily:,"Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night.
"
6,5,25,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, as you may remember, Max was a friend of Marshall's from law school... with whom Robin was really starting to hit it off.
"
6,5,26,Marshall:,"Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness.
"
6,5,27,Lily:,"Yeah. He's a sweet guy. She feels really comfortable with him. They bonded over hockey. I guess he has a small pen1s, but they want to double-date next weekend.
"
6,5,28,Marshall:,"Why would you tell me that?
"
6,5,29,Lily:,"So you'll clear your schedule.
"
6,5,30,Marshall:,"No! The other part!
"
6,5,31,Lily:,"Oh, the small pen1s thing?
"
6,5,32,Marshall:,"Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him ""Max.""
"
6,5,33,Lily:,"That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small pen1s...
"
6,5,34,Marshall:,"Just don't!
"
6,5,35,Barney:,"You're kidding me.
"
6,5,36,Ted:,"I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?
"
6,5,37,Barney:,"Snakes.
"
6,5,38,Ted:,"Did you just say ""snakes""?
"
6,5,39,Barney:,"I don't recall saying ""snakes"". Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.
"
6,5,40,Ted:,"New is always better?
"
6,5,41,Barney:,"You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.
"
6,5,42,Ted:,"Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?
"
6,5,43,Barney:,"Everything.
"
6,5,44,Ted:,"So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?
"
6,5,45,Barney:,"Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.
"
6,5,46,Ted:,"And when you're at a Guns n' Roses concert, you're like, ""Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy""?
"
6,5,47,Barney:,"Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted.
"
6,5,48,Ted:,"Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?
"
6,5,49,Wendy:,"Glenmckenna, aged 30 years in oak casks.
"
6,5,50,Ted:,"Amazing. And what's your newest scotch?
"
6,5,51,Wendy:,"Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch. Don't let it touch your skin.
"
6,5,52,Ted:,"Your call, buddy.
"
6,5,53,Barney:,"A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!
"
6,5,54,Marshall:,"Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. ""Hey, look how big my cell phone is!"" You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.
"
6,5,55,Robin:,"Lily told you.
"
6,5,56,Ted:,"Told him what?
"
6,5,57,Lily:,"Max has a small pen1s.
"
6,5,58,Barney:,"How can you speak of such things?
"
6,5,59,Robin:,"Girls talk about everything.
"
6,5,60,Lily:,"Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation...
"
6,5,61,Robin:,"Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...
"
6,5,62,Barney:,"How can you speak of such things?
"
6,5,63,Lily:,"You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, ""Boobs?"" Not the complete sentence, ""Does she have big boobs?"" Which also would not be great. Just: ""Boobs?""
"
6,5,64,Barney:,"I do not do that.
"
6,5,65,Lily:,"My friend Lori from work...
"
6,5,66,Barney:,"Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?
"
6,5,67,Lily:,"So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.
"
6,5,68,Marshall:,"Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.
"
6,5,69,Barney:,"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.
"
6,5,70,Ted:,"I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.
"
6,5,71,Barney:,"I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?
"
6,5,72,Robin:,"Duh. Of course there's a girl.
"
6,5,73,Ted:,"What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.
"
6,5,74,Barney:,"Boobs?
"
6,5,75,Woman:,"Beautiful building, right?
"
6,5,76,Ted:,"Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...
"
6,5,77,Woman:,"I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow.
"
6,5,78,Ted:,"Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...
"
6,5,79,Woman:,"Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices...
"
6,5,80,Ted:,"She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!
"
6,5,81,Barney:,"Whose dream?
"
6,5,82,Ted:,"We wound up talking for hours.
"
6,5,83,Woman:,"I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.
"
6,5,84,Ted:,"Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.
"
6,5,85,Woman:,"Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.
"
6,5,86,Ted:,"You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.
"
6,5,87,Woman:,"You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.
"
6,5,88,Ted:,"Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.
"
6,5,89,Woman:,"That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tranny before, but it's still sweet.
"
6,5,90,Barney:,"Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.
"
6,5,91,Woman:,"Hey, Ted, can I ask you something
"
6,5,92,Ted:,"Anything.
"
6,5,93,Woman:,"Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian"" We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?
"
6,5,94,Barney:,"And you said...?
"
6,5,95,Ted:,"Where do I sign?
"
6,5,96,Barney:,"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?
"
6,5,97,Ted:,"This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.
"
6,5,98,Barney:,"And what did this ""Zoey"" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?
"
6,5,99,Marshall:,"Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.
"
6,5,100,Ted:,"Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...
"
6,5,101,Zoey:,"So what do you do, Ted?
"
6,5,102,Ted:,"I'm a veterinarian.
"
6,5,103,Ted:,"What? I panicked!
"
6,5,104,Barney:,"This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.
"
6,5,105,Ted:,"I don't do that.
"
6,5,106,Ted:,"Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard) Look, she's really hot, okay?
"
6,5,107,Ted:,"Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.
"
6,5,108,Barney:,"Asian girls love them some Jews.
"
6,5,109,Ted:,"And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.
"
6,5,110,Lily:,"Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.
"
6,5,111,Marshall:,"And you're welcome.
"
6,5,112,Ted:,"The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?
"
6,5,113,Barney:,"No. Technically, they were eggs.
"
6,5,114,Ted:,"Did you just say ""eggs""?
"
6,5,115,Barney:,"I don't recall saying ""eggs.""
"
6,5,116,Max:,"So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, ""Holy crap, I'm about to quit""""
"
6,5,117,"Marshall, thinking:","Small pen1s. You have a small pen1s. Oh, that's super interesting, but you have a small pen1s. Damn it, Marshall! Okay. Okay. Think of any two words other than ""small"" or ""pen1s"". Got it: small pen1s. Damn it!
"
6,5,118,Robin:,"Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.
"
6,5,119,Max:,"Well, right now it's a pretty small practice.
"
6,5,120,Marshall:,"Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.
"
6,5,121,Max:,"Bro, it's... pretty small.
"
6,5,122,Marshall:,"Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? ""The motion of the ocean."" That whole thing.
"
6,5,123,Robin:,"He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.
"
6,5,124,Marshall:,"I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.
"
6,5,125,Max:,"Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff.
"
6,5,126,Robin:,"Let's order!
"
6,5,127,Ted from 2030:,"As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity...
"
6,5,128,Ted:,"Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.
"
6,5,129,Ted from 2030:,"..the strangest thing happened.
"
6,5,130,Zoey:,"I need your help. (They go outside. Zoey opens the back doors of a truck) Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal.
"
6,5,131,Ted:,"Wasn't expecting bunnies.
"
6,5,132,Zoey:,"I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, ""Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay.""
"
6,5,133,Ted:,"Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?
"
6,5,134,Max:,"Well, I know what I'm getting.Oh? Oh?The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge.
"
6,5,135,Marshall:,"Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.
"
6,5,136,Max:,"Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right.
"
6,5,137,Robin:,"Totally.
"
6,5,138,Marshall:,"We'll just be here. (He gives a hug to Max)You're great.
"
6,5,139,Max:,"Ah. Thanks, bro. It's, uh.... it's going on a while.
"
6,5,140,Marshall:,"I know.
"
6,5,141,Max:,"Thanks.
"
6,5,142,Lily:,"Damn, baby, be cool!
"
6,5,143,Robin:,"You're acting like he has six months to live.
"
6,5,144,Marshall:,"It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!
"
6,5,145,Robin:,"Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?
"
6,5,146,Marshall:,"Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?
"
6,5,147,Marshall:,"It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.
"
6,5,148,Lily:,"Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about s*x?
"
6,5,149,Marshall:,"Yes, we do, but you know what we say? ""I hit that.""""I got some.""""I tapped it."" ""I squeezed those."" Discreet and efficient.
"
6,5,150,Robin:,"Not to mention classy.
"
6,5,151,Marshall:,"Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our s*x life, I'd probably kill myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?
"
6,5,152,Lily:,"Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!
"
6,5,153,Marshall:,"Are you sure?
"
6,5,154,Robin:,"Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.
"
6,5,155,Ted:,"You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?
"
6,5,156,Zoey:,"Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy.
"
6,5,157,Ted:,"Wow. You're a little bit crazy.
"
6,5,158,Zoey:,"Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box.
"
6,5,159,Ted:,"Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...
"
6,5,160,Zoey:,"Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.
"
6,5,161,Barney:,"Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!
"
6,5,162,Ted:,"Solid C-cup, perky bounce.
"
6,5,163,Barney:,"Momentary grudging respect.
"
6,5,164,Ted:,"Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.
"
6,5,165,Barney:,"Ted, that is never gonna happen.
"
6,5,166,Ted:,"Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.
"
6,5,167,Zoey:,"Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana.
"
6,5,168,Man:,"Oh, bummer!
"
6,5,169,Ted:,"Hey.
"
6,5,170,Zoey:,"Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came.
"
6,5,171,Ted:,"Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with ""Save The Arcadian.""
"
6,5,172,Zoey:,"Great. I'll grab you a picket sign. Hmm. Do you want ""GNB puts the douche in fiduciary..""...or ""It's always 4:20 somewhere""? Dudes, you forgot your signs!
"
6,5,173,Ted from 2030:,"As I looked up at that magnificent old structure, I realized I wasn't letting my feelings for Zoey mislead me. This building really was worth saving.
"
6,5,174,Zoey:,"Ted, everything okay? Yea... um... um... You work for GNB?
"
6,5,175,Man:,"Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?
"
6,5,176,Ted:,"She was really hot, okay?
"
6,5,177,Ted:,"How the hell could you do that?
"
6,5,178,Barney:,"Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.
"
6,5,179,Ted:,"The billboard, Barney.
"
6,5,180,Barney:,"I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.
"
6,5,181,Ted:,"You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.
"
6,5,182,Barney:,"Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!
"
6,5,183,Ted:,"Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!
"
6,5,184,Barney:,"Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.
"
6,5,185,Ted:,"You named the rabbit?
"
6,5,186,Barney:,"You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.
"
6,5,187,Ted:,"You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.
"
6,5,188,Barney:,"So you're back in?
"
6,5,189,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
6,5,190,Ted from 2030:,"That night, as I worked on a new design that just might solve all my problems... Marshall was visited by a disturbing vision.
"
6,5,191,Lily:,"Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.
"
6,5,192,Robin:,"Uh, it looks disgusting.
"
6,5,193,Marshall:,"Uh, is this working for you?
"
6,5,194,Lily:,"""Uh, is this working for you?""
"
6,5,195,Robin:,"Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?
"
6,5,196,Lily:,"Oh, you're bad.
"
6,5,197,Robin:,"More Cosmos?
"
6,5,198,Marshall:,"I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!
"
6,5,199,Lily:,"Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.
"
6,5,200,Marshall:,"Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.
"
6,5,201,Zoey:,"Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.
"
6,5,202,Ted:,"Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?
"
6,5,203,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until...
"
6,5,204,Ted:,"Are you married?
"
6,5,205,Zoey:,"Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved?
"
6,5,206,Ted:,"This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.
"
6,5,207,Ted:,"Yeah, it was about the girl.
"
6,5,208,Zoey:,"Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?
"
6,5,209,Ted:,"This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.
"
6,5,210,Zoey:,"Snakes?
"
6,5,211,Ted:,"I don't recall saying snakes.
"
6,5,212,Lily:,"Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, ""I can't do this,"" and storms out.
"
6,5,213,Robin:,"Wow, that is weird.
"
6,5,214,Lily:,"But here's the crazier part.
"
6,5,215,Marshall:,"No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!
"
6,5,216,Lily:,"It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.
"
6,5,217,Robin:,"Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?
"
6,5,218,Lily:,"Yup. ""'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the..."" I can't read that, baby.
"
6,5,219,Marshall:,"""Musky scent of man.""
"
6,5,220,Lily:,"""As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.""
"
6,5,221,Robin:,"That sounds real.
"
6,5,222,Ted from 2030:,"And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again.
"
6,5,223,Zoey:,"Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!
"
6,5,224,Ted from 2030:,"Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again.
"
6,5,225,Marshall:,"How's it going with Robin?
"
6,5,226,Max:,"Uh, I think I have to break up with her.
"
6,5,227,Marshall:,"Really? Why? You with her?
"
6,5,228,Max:,"Yeah, well, there's this... kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom.
"
6,5,229,Ted:,"Hey, what's not for everyone?
"
6,5,230,Marshall:,"Guys, come on. What is it?
"
6,5,231,Max:,"Come on, bro. This is a locker room.
"
6,5,232,Marshall:,"I... What do you think it was, Murray?
"
6,11,1,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, in the winter of 2010, we had a new addition to our little group... Zoey. Zoey was married to... The Captain.
"
6,11,2,Captain:,"Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?
"
6,11,3,Marshall:,"Okay. That man is terrifying.
"
6,11,4,Barney:,"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.
"
6,11,5,Ted:,"Keep smiling. He can still see us.
"
6,11,6,Ted from 2030:,"There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until...
"
6,11,7,Marshall:,"I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.
"
6,11,8,Robin:,"Okay.
"
6,11,9,Marshall:,"Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. (everyone is murmuring happily) But the top half of his face...wants to murder you! Cheerful. Wants to murder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to murder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!
"
6,11,10,Barney:,"Captain, what do you think of rainy days?
"
6,11,11,Marshall:,"Whoa, he hates them.
"
6,11,12,Robin:,"Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.
"
6,11,13,Ted:,"Ooh. What-What is that?
"
6,11,14,Robin and Lily:,"I don't get it.
"
6,11,15,Marshall:,"He hates that he loves them.
"
6,11,16,Ted:,"Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?
"
6,11,17,Lily:,"Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.
"
6,11,18,Marshall:,"Running the water.
"
6,11,19,Robin:,"Holding the towel.
"
6,11,20,Barney:,"And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.
"
6,11,21,Ted:,"All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.
"
6,11,22,Lily:,"Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...
"
6,11,23,Barney:,"Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.
"
6,11,24,Lily:,"Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles.
"
6,11,25,Marshall:,"Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.
"
6,11,26,Lily:,"Rule number two: No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.
"
6,11,27,Ted:,"Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.
"
6,11,28,Lily:,"And the most important rule of all...
"
6,11,29,Barney:,"Lubricant is public property. (Robin groans)
"
6,11,30,Marshall:,"Please.
"
6,11,31,Lily:,"No lying to the spouse about anything you do.
"
6,11,32,Ted:,"Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.
"
6,11,33,Marshall:,"Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x.
"
6,11,34,Robin:,"Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?
"
6,11,35,Marshall:,"No doubt, Robo Cop.
"
6,11,36,Lily:,"You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.
"
6,11,37,Marshall:,"I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone.
"
6,11,38,Robin:,"Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us.
"
6,11,39,Lily:,"Oh! Sweet. No candles.
"
6,11,40,Barney:,"Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?
"
6,11,41,Ted from 2030:,"And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being.
"
6,11,42,Lily:,"Nah.
"
6,11,43,Ted from 2030:,"Wait. No. It had to be more than just, ""Nah."" Oh, I think she said...
"
6,11,44,Lily:,"You're a big... stupid octopus head!
"
6,11,45,Ted from 2030:,"No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night...
"
6,11,46,Ted:,"Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.
"
6,11,47,Zoey:,"Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.
"
6,11,48,Ted:,"Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.
"
6,11,49,Lily:,"Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?
"
6,11,50,Ted:,"Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?
"
6,11,51,Zoey:,"Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?
"
6,11,52,Ted:,"It's totally okay.
"
6,11,53,Lily:,"It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. ""Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""""I love your mom""""I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it"""" Sound familiar, Pinocchio?
"
6,11,54,Marshall:,"What's wrong with this shirt?
"
6,11,55,Ted:,"Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?
"
6,11,56,Lily:,"No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.
"
6,11,57,Ted:,"Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.
"
6,11,58,Lily:,"Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.
"
6,11,59,Ted from 2030:,"The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. Now historically, they had three solid conversation topics: cold weather...
"
6,11,60,Robin:,"December chill... so great.
"
6,11,61,Marshall:,"Totally.
"
6,11,62,Ted from 2030:,"..sports...
"
6,11,63,Marshall:,"Did you catch the game last night?
"
6,11,64,Robin:,"Yeah. Nail-biter.
"
6,11,65,Ted from 2030:,"..and cold weather sports.
"
6,11,66,Marshall:,"You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.
"
6,11,67,Robin:,"They are fun.
"
6,11,68,Ted from 2030:,"They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds.
"
6,11,69,Robin:,"Man, this is awkward.
"
6,11,70,Marshall:,"She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.
"
6,11,71,Robin:,"Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.
"
6,11,72,Waiter:,"Can I get you two some drinks?
"
6,11,73,Marshall:,"Lots of drinks.
"
6,11,74,Robin:,"Oh, so many drinks.
"
6,11,75,Ted from 2030:,"That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing?
"
6,11,76,Lily:,"Barney.
"
6,11,77,Barney:,"Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.
"
6,11,78,Lily:,"Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.
"
6,11,79,"Barney, crying:","No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?!
"
6,11,80,Lily:,"Watch out!
"
6,11,81,Ted from 2030:,"Wait. They were on the street.
"
6,11,82,Lily:,"Watch out!
"
6,11,83,Barney:,"Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.
"
6,11,84,Lily:,"I think I probably didn't.
"
6,11,85,Ted from 2030:,"And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes.
"
6,11,86,Lily:,"Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.
"
6,11,87,Ted from 2030:,"Like I said, the fight was just getting started.
"
6,11,88,Ted:,"Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.
"
6,11,89,Captain:,"Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.
"
6,11,90,Ted:,"Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?
"
6,11,91,Captain:,"Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.
"
6,11,92,Ted:,"Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.
"
6,11,93,Captain:,"You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!
"
6,11,94,Ted from 2030:,"Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night.
"
6,11,95,Robin:,"You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.
"
6,11,96,Marshall:,"You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.
"
6,11,97,Robin:,"What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.
"
6,11,98,Marshall:,"Robin, I'm an attorney.
"
6,11,99,Robin:,"Fine. This night's a little awkward.
"
6,11,100,Marshall:,"I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.
"
6,11,101,Robin:,"Why is that?
"
6,11,102,Marshall:,"It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.
"
6,11,103,Marshall:,"Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.
"
6,11,104,Barney:,"So, who's the eye broccoli?
"
6,11,105,Marshall:,"Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.
"
6,11,106,Barney:,"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.
"
6,11,107,Marshall:,"I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
"
6,11,108,Barney:,"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?
"
6,11,109,Marshall:,"I'm sorry. Myth?
"
6,11,110,Barney:,"It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.
"
6,11,111,Marshall:,"And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...
"
6,11,112,Barney:,"D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.
"
6,11,113,Marshall:,"Did we bet on this?
"
6,11,114,Barney:,"Let's say yes.
"
6,11,115,Robin:,"And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.
"
6,11,116,Marshall:,"As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.
"
6,11,117,Robin:,"Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?
"
6,11,118,Marshall:,"Big-time manatee.
"
6,11,119,Robin:,"What were those sailors thinking?
"
6,11,120,Marshall:,"Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.
"
6,11,121,Captain:,"Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this. (screams) Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.
"
6,11,122,Ted:,"He's gonna kill me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.
"
6,11,123,Captain:,"So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.
"
6,11,124,Ted from 2030:,"Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about.
"
6,11,125,Lily:,"Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.
"
6,11,126,Barney:,"What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!
"
6,11,127,Ted from 2030:,"Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney.
"
6,11,128,Lily:,"Want to hang?
"
6,11,129,Barney:,"Nah. Watch out!
"
6,11,130,Lily:,"Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.
"
6,11,131,Lily:,"If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!
"
6,11,132,Ted from 2030:,"Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.
"
6,11,133,Barney:,"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
"
6,11,134,Lily:,"You're a jerk.
"
6,11,135,Ted from 2030:,"Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time.
"
6,11,136,Captain:,"Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.
"
6,11,137,Ted:,"Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?
"
6,11,138,Captain:,"How now? Oh, bother. (sighs) Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.
"
6,11,139,Ted:,"Head?
"
6,11,140,Captain:,"200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.
"
6,11,141,Ted:,"Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...
"
6,11,142,Captain:,"Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.
"
6,11,143,Ted:," Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a ""Good Effort"" ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.
"
6,11,144,Captain:,"Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.
"
6,11,145,Ted from 2030:,"nd just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.
"
6,11,146,Captain:,"Ted?
"
6,11,147,Robin:,"you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?
"
6,11,148,Marshall:,"Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...
"
6,11,149,Robin:,"Am I blushing or...?
"
6,11,150,Marshall:,"..but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' ""Part of Your World"" to my pants.
"
6,11,151,Robin:,"Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?
"
6,11,152,Marshall:,"I asked Barney the same thing.
"
6,11,153,Barney:,"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.
"
6,11,154,Marshall:,"Death?
"
6,11,155,Barney:,"Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.
"
6,11,156,Robin:,"Pregnancy?
"
6,11,157,Marshall:,"Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.
"
6,11,158,Ted from 2030:,"Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.
"
6,11,159,Barney:,"Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?
"
6,11,160,Liy:,"Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.
"
6,11,161,Barney:,"High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.
"
6,11,162,Lily:,"Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!
"
6,11,163,Ted from 2030:,"That was it! I remember now!
"
6,11,164,Lily:,"Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face!
"
6,11,165,Barney:,"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
"
6,11,166,Lily:,"Oh... You're a jerk.
"
6,11,167,Barney:,"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.
"
6,11,168,Lily:,"hat's that?
"
6,11,169,Barney:,"Breast-feeding. Hot.
"
6,11,170,Lily:,"Really?
"
6,11,171,Barney:,"Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.
"
6,11,172,Lily:,"That's so sweet!
"
6,11,173,Ted from 2030:,"See kids? Told you I'd get it!
"
6,11,174,Ted:,"Okay, now we're even!
"
6,11,175,Ted from 2030:,"Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there.
"
6,11,176,Captain:,"So you really thought I was gonna kill you?
"
6,11,177,Ted:,"Well... ish.
"
6,11,178,Captain:,"Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.
"
6,11,179,Ted:,"See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?
"
6,11,180,Captain:,"Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.
"
6,11,181,Ted:,"We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.
"
6,11,182,Captain:,"Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is.
"
6,11,183,"Robin, slurring:","You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation and just focused on the drinking... I had fun.
"
6,11,184,Marshall:,"Yeah, me, too.
"
6,11,185,Ted from 2030:,"And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see...
"
6,11,186,Marshall:,"No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!
"
6,11,187,Robin:,"Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. (She vomits) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.
"
6,11,188,Marshall:,"I really do.
"
6,11,189,Ted from 2030:,"And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever.
"
6,11,190,Zoey:,"Hey, Ted.
"
6,11,191,Ted:,"Hey. You feeling better?
"
6,11,192,Zoey:,"I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.
"
6,11,193,Ted:,"You weren't?
"
6,11,194,Zoey:,"I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together.
"
6,11,195,Ted:,"I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.
"
6,11,196,Zoey:,"Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous.
"
6,11,197,Ted:,"Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.
"
6,11,198,Zoey:,"Me, too.
"
6,11,199,Ted:,"I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?
"
6,11,200,Zoey:,"No. Do you?
"
6,11,201,Ted:,"No.
"
6,11,202,Sailor #1:,"Still no sign of land.
"
6,11,203,Sailor #2:,"It's been 243 days since we've seen another living soul. What are you looking at?
"
6,11,204,Sailor #1:,"Dude, we need to find land.
"
