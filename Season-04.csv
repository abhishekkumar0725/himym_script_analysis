4,20,1,Barney:,"I heard a joke at work.
"
4,20,2,Ted:,"Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.
"
4,20,3,Barney:,"It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it.
"
4,20,4,Marshall:,"Do it yourself.
"
4,20,5,Lily:,"Tell it.
"
4,20,6,Barney:,"Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella? (Marshall laughs) It's funny.
"
4,20,7,Ted:,"For the guys.
"
4,20,8,Marshall:,"She will not like it.
"
4,20,9,Lily:,"Why do not I decide? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?
"
4,20,10,Ted (2030):,"Can Barney gave the fall. To date, it remains the most disgusting joke I have ever heard in my life. And no, I do not say.
"
4,20,11,Lily:,"Yeah, I can not hang out with you.
"
4,20,12,Barney:,"Come on. It's funny. This is...
"
4,20,13,Ted:,"I told you so.
"
4,20,14,Barney:,"She'll be back.
"
4,20,15,Ted (2030):,"And we saw more Lily for 4 weeks.
"
4,20,16,Ted (2030):,"The children, after being fired, I finally realized my lifelong dream: to create my own architectural firm. I had just customers.
"
4,20,17,"Robin, out of the room:","I think it's great that you fly with your own wings. I admire that.
"
4,20,18,Ted:,"Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment.
"
4,20,19,Robin:,"Yeah, sure. Anything you want.
"
4,20,20,Ted:,"A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor?
"
4,20,21,Robin:,"It's not work!
"
4,20,22,Ted:,"Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen!
"
4,20,23,Robin:,"I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs.
"
4,20,24,Ted:,"I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.
"
4,20,25,Barney:,"You know for layoffs?
"
4,20,26,Marshall:,"Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?
"
4,20,27,Barney:,"Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire.
"
4,20,28,Marshall:,"I would like to have your insurance.
"
4,20,29,Barney:,"You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.
"
4,20,30,Marshall:,"I work harder than anyone in my division.
"
4,20,31,Barney:,"Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.
"
4,20,32,Marshall:,"What do you mean something?
"
4,20,33,Barney:,"You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco.
"
4,20,34,Ted (2030):,"Marcus Denisco worked in accounting, and it was probably the worst employee of the box.
"
4,20,35,Marcus:,"I brought donuts. They are probably stupid.
"
4,20,36,Ted (2030):,"But ultimately, it was called...
"
4,20,37,All:,"Chow-man!
"
4,20,38,Marcus:,"Who wants pork barbecue? Of course you want!
"
4,20,39,Marshall:,"I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?
"
4,20,40,Barney:,"It's always food.
"
4,20,41,Marshall:,"It's always food.
"
4,20,42,Barney:,"You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man.
"
4,20,43,Marshall:,"I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.
"
4,20,44,Barney:,"Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man.
"
4,20,45,Toy-Man:,"Bad news. As HR, I must review the new overtime policy with you. The good news is that we will do with Wolverine's claws! (They start to play all three) Section 5A: doing overtime will no longer be paid double.
"
4,20,46,Marshall:,"That's great!
"
4,20,47,Barney:,"Claw tape!
"
4,20,48,Marshall:,"I love Toy-man.
"
4,20,49,Barney:,"You see? You need something. Youtube-like man.
"
4,20,50,Marshall:,"You're right. I need something.
"
4,20,51,Barney:,"But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.
"
4,20,52,Barney:,"You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office.
"
4,20,53,"Massage man, massaging the shoulders of Marshall:","Hi, dude.
"
4,20,54,Marshall:,"Hi, Douglas.
"
4,20,55,Douglas:,"You're so tense.
"
4,20,56,Marshall:,"I was relaxed, two seconds ago.
"
4,20,57,"Douglas, Barney:","You're next.
"
4,20,58,Man:,"Welcome to Mosbius Designs.
"
4,20,59,Robin:,"Who are you?
"
4,20,60,Man:,"PJ, the assistant of Mr. Mosby.
"
4,20,61,Robin:,"What's going on?
"
4,20,62,PJ:,"Sorry. You do not interrupt Mr. Mosby during his hours of reflection.
"
4,20,63,"Ted, by phone at PJ interposed:","Good, PJ. This is Robin. She lives here.
"
4,20,64,PJ:,"Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. You need something else?
"
4,20,65,Ted:,"I would not refuse a cup of coffee.
"
4,20,66,Robin:,"You're right next door!
"
4,20,67,Robin:,"So now Ted is assisted to do nothing.
"
4,20,68,Ted:,"PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind.
"
4,20,69,Robin:,"Yes, the guide.
"
4,20,70,Ted:,"I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.
"
4,20,71,Man:,"I will. Thank you very much, Mr. Mosby.
"
4,20,72,Ted:,"All right.
"
4,20,73,Robin:,"This table just told me that you're an idiot.
"
4,20,74,Robin:,"This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers.
"
4,20,75,Ted:,"I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test.
"
4,20,76,Robin:,"Okay, but PJ does not help.
"
4,20,77,Barney:,"If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere.
"
4,20,78,Ted:,"You see? It is useful.
"
4,20,79,Barney:,"PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?
"
4,20,80,Ted:,"No, I guide him.
"
4,20,81,Barney:,"A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?
"
4,20,82,Ted:,"Ted Mosby?
"
4,20,83,Barney:,"Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead!(He rises) PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me.
"
4,20,84,Marshall:,"I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?
"
4,20,85,Barney:,"Fired. What else you got?
"
4,20,86,Marshall:,"I have others. Ties-Fun-man.
"
4,20,87,Barney:,"Fired.
"
4,20,88,Marshall:,"Info-Unusual-man?
"
4,20,89,Barney:,"Did you know? Whether you're fired?
"
4,20,90,Marshall:,"Stretch-man?
"
4,20,91,Barney:,"upside down Vir√©.
"
4,20,92,Marshall:,"The Monty-Python-man?
"
4,20,93,Barney:,"We are the knights who say... You're fired.
"
4,20,94,Marshall:,"Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.
"
4,20,95,Barney:,"Not bad. You got maybe something.
"
4,20,96,Marshall:,"Great! Great! I Simulates-man!
"
4,20,97,Barney:,"Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man.
"
4,20,98,Man:,"OK, guys?
"
4,20,99,Barney:,"Hi, Frank.
"
4,20,100,Ted:,"Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time. (Hangs up) Wait.""Ted Mosby House."" The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Robin in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?
"
4,20,101,Robin:,"At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together.
"
4,20,102,Ted:,"Inspiration... do your work.
"
4,20,103,PJ:,"Each time, chief. Every time.
"
4,20,104,Robin:,"Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?
"
4,20,105,PJ:,"No idea, but probably the taste of engineering.
"
4,20,106,Robin:,"It's locked?
"
4,20,107,PJ:,"Visitors must register for the key.
"
4,20,108,Robin:,"Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?
"
4,20,109,PJ:,"I tell you that you must ask permission to use the toilet in my premises.
"
4,20,110,Robin:,"Why does it excite me?
"
4,20,111,Ted:,"There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?
"
4,20,112,Robin:,"When I leave the job, it is 5:30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet?
"
4,20,113,Man:,"I distribute the newspaper, it's dirty but someone has to do. Do not worry, I wash them before you fiddle with the parties.
"
4,20,114,Man:,"I live with my mom. In the evening they watch TV in bed.It's called ""The club hugs.""
"
4,20,115,Robin:,"So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it?
"
4,20,116,Man:,"Look, we'll do it or not?
"
4,20,117,Ted:,"First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity.
"
4,20,118,Robin:,"What productivity? You did not call a single customer.
"
4,20,119,Ted:,"Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call.
"
4,20,120,Robin:,"Seminar?
"
4,20,121,PJ:,"Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.
"
4,20,122,Barney:,"Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.
"
4,20,123,Marshall:,"It's a bit harder than I thought. Registration fees, transaction charges penalty, I... keeps a lot of money.
"
4,20,124,Grub-man:,"Good job, Sport-man. That's last week.
"
4,20,125,Marshall:,"60, 80, 100. $ 18 000 in cash. It's nothing. I'll bring it home and put them in a safe place. (Marshall is in the street) OK, walk down the street with money in his pocket. Not touch the money. It's so obvious. Be natural. The baby looks at me.Babies can smell money. It is known! I carry a lot of money!
"
4,20,126,Marshall:,"Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.
"
4,20,127,Barney:,"Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.
"
4,20,128,Marshall:,"A waste?
"
4,20,129,Barney:,"Last week!
"
4,20,130,Marshall:,"This is Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. How is the home office?
"
4,20,131,Ted:,"Okay, until Robin sleeps with my assistant.
"
4,20,132,Robin:,"This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.
"
4,20,133,Barney:,"I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!
"
4,20,134,Marshall:,"Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?
"
4,20,135,Barney:,"Because it hurts!
"
4,20,136,Marshall:,"How so?
"
4,20,137,Barney:,"It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.
"
4,20,138,Marshall:,"I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.
"
4,20,139,Barney:,"It's funny anyway, right?
"
4,20,140,Marshall:,"It's very funny.
"
4,20,141,Ted:,"Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that.
"
4,20,142,PJ:,"You know what? I had to send the wrong photo.
"
4,20,143,Ted:,"You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a shooting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired.
"
4,20,144,PJ:,"You can not fire me...
"
4,20,145,Ted:,"You're fired.
"
4,20,146,PJ:,"Well! (He takes his phone) Hi, baby, I've just been fired.Yes, I'll wait with you. (He settles on the couch and turn on the TV) The Wheel of Fortune.
"
4,20,147,PJ:,"I like having all this time to spend with you book. I'll kiss you there... And there... And here and there. And...
"
4,20,148,Robin:,"One more.
"
4,20,149,Ted:,"Stop.
"
4,20,150,PJ:,"I'm going to the toilet. I'll miss you.
"
4,20,151,Robin:,"I'll miss you too.
"
4,20,152,Ted:,"You've already tired of him.
"
4,20,153,Robin:,"It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream.
"
4,20,154,Ted:,"""It's the dream""? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?
"
4,20,155,Robin:,"I have to stop, right? I know not break.
"
4,20,156,PJ:,"I still have to go, but I could no longer stay away from you.
"
4,20,157,Robin:,"Listen... Dude, I know.
"
4,20,158,PJ:,"What?
"
4,20,159,Robin:,"Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?
"
4,20,160,PJ:,"It's on what?
"
4,20,161,Robin:,"I feel it.
"
4,20,162,PJ:,"Do you not feel anything?
"
4,20,163,Robin:,"But friends and others.
"
4,20,164,Ted:,"My God, this is the worst break.
"
4,20,165,PJ:,"You're breaking up with me?
"
4,20,166,Robin:,"If this is what you want, I totally understand.
"
4,20,167,Toy-man:,"You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.
"
4,20,168,Barney:,"You see, Sports-man. People adore you.
"
4,20,169,Marshall:,"I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow.
"
4,20,170,Douglas:,"Hi, dude. We need you to do this exchange, I can prepare my team. You are really tight, is it not?
"
4,20,171,Marshall:,"Seriously, it's over.
"
4,20,172,Douglas:,"I stop?
"
4,20,173,Marshall:,"No.
"
4,20,174,Ted (2030):,"With the breakdown of Robin and PJ, I was free to change the personnel office.
"
4,20,175,PJ:,"Welcome Mosbius Designs.
"
4,20,176,Robin:,"Are you kidding?
"
4,20,177,Ted (2030):,"Now that PJ came back to work...
"
4,20,178,Ted:,"Are you kidding?
"
4,20,179,Marshall:,"Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.
"
4,20,180,Barney:,"You're kidding!
"
4,20,181,Marshall:,"How are you?
"
4,20,182,Barney:,"As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...
"
4,20,183,Marshall:,"I know you're in love with Robin.
"
4,20,184,Barney:,"What?
"
4,20,185,Marshall:,"Lily told me.
"
4,20,186,Barney:,"She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.
"
4,20,187,Marshall:,"Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.
"
4,20,188,Barney:,"Really?
"
4,20,189,Marshall:,"It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.
"
4,20,190,Barney:,"Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.
"
4,20,191,Marshall:,"Tell her how you feel?
"
4,20,192,Barney:,"No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.
"
4,20,193,Marshall:,"I can perhaps help you.
"
4,20,194,Barney:,"You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.
"
4,20,195,Ted (2030):,"Meanwhile, I thank you without fight against Robin and PJ continued.
"
4,20,196,Ted:,"I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?
"
4,20,197,Robin:,"I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?
"
4,20,198,PJ:,"Listen... you're great. But I chose another job. This is for you. Robin, I hope this letter will offer a conclusion. You will really miss.
"
4,20,199,Chow-Man:,"Manny Ramirez is not exchange against two replacements!
"
4,20,200,Toy-man:,"If you put your veto, I am going!
"
4,20,201,PJ:,"I'll find something.
"
4,20,202,Barney:,"Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.
"
4,20,203,Robin:,"Are you okay?
"
4,20,204,Ted:,"And if I did not think the books?
"
4,20,205,Robin:,"Sorry?
"
4,20,206,Ted:,"There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?
"
4,20,207,Robin:,"No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.
"
4,20,208,Ted:,"The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.
"
4,20,209,Robin:,"You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy ""funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious."" And apparently, I just... ""In my apartment."" You thought that you would have understood, now?
"
4,20,210,Ted:,"Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.
"
4,20,211,Robin:,"You can do it.
"
4,20,212,Ted:,"Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future.
"
4,20,213,Robin:,"It looks good.
"
4,20,214,Ted:,"I looked confident?
"
4,20,215,Robin:,"Now known as a real customer.
"
4,20,216,Ted:,"Great.
"
4,20,217,Marshall:,"Hey, Chow-man!
"
4,20,218,Barney:,"Hey, Toy-man!
"
4,20,219,Marshall:,"Who's this guy?
"
4,20,220,Barney:,"He is not here. I think we should leave.
"
4,20,221,Marshall:,"Really?
"
4,20,222,Barney:,"It's happened before.
"
4,8,1,Ted (2030):,"Children at the end of 2008, your Aunt Robin was unemployed and a little adrift, so his friendship with Lily was more important than ever.
"
4,8,2,Robin:,"So, it seems that Marshall has to work late on Friday.You know what that means, party girls.
"
4,8,3,Lily:,"Well, a teacher at my school, Jillian, a birthday. What?
"
4,8,4,Robin:,"It's just that... I have never heard of this before Jillian, and suddenly, it's your best friend. You do not stop talking about her.
"
4,8,5,Lily:,"Do not be jealous. We hang out together all the time.
"
4,8,6,Robin:,"Yeah, but Marshall is still there. There was not much time to talk, just us two.
"
4,8,7,Lily:,"This is false.
"
4,8,8,Robin:,"This is where the story gets really good. So it goes...
"
4,8,9,Marshall:,"Hi.
"
4,8,10,Robin:,".. place. And then this... guy talking about this thing with the stuff of which I spoke the other day about this place.Well, anyway... it happened.
"
4,8,11,Marshall:,"My God. You and the guy the mayor's office did it to the UN under the office of Ambassador of Zaire? Cool.
"
4,8,12,Robin:,"I wish we had time for girls. I love Marshall, but I am not free to express myself.
"
4,8,13,Lily:,"Come with me and Jillian, then.
"
4,8,14,Robin:,"OK, but I want to stay too late because... (Marshall and Ted joined them at the table) Do you remember... this thing last month after going there? You know who said it was going, but she gave me tips.
"
4,8,15,Marshall:,"You always mycoses?
"
4,8,16,Barney:,"I want to take this moment.
"
4,8,17,Marshall:,"Which one?
"
4,8,18,Barney:,"The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted.
"
4,8,19,Ted:,"Marshall is my best friend.
"
4,8,20,Barney:,"Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect?
"
4,8,21,Ted:,"My best friend does not, but still.
"
4,8,22,Barney:,"You draw what now?
"
4,8,23,Ted:,"Well, you renovate the library Nouillorc.
"
4,8,24,Robin:,"That's great!
"
4,8,25,Ted:,"No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts: fishing and not fishing.
"
4,8,26,Barney:,"I think you'll love what's happened at work.
"
4,8,27,Bilson:,"While corruption has destabilized the regime and killed most of the royal family, it helped to relax banking regulation in Rangoon. Good for us. Last order of the meeting it was decided to continue on the project's new headquarters in the city of Goliath National Bank.
"
4,8,28,Ted:,"Who's going to draw?
"
4,8,29,Barney:,"That was my first question.
"
4,8,30,Barney:,"Who's going to draw?
"
4,8,31,Bilson:,"We approached a company. This Swedish architectural collective called Sven.
"
4,8,32,Ted:,"Sven?
"
4,8,33,Ted (2030):,"Sven was this swedish architecture collective revered for their bold, innovative designs. I hated them.
"
4,8,34,Ted:,"I hate them. Swedish architecture collective.
"
4,8,35,Robin:,"No one.
"
4,8,36,Lily:,"Pretentious.
"
4,8,37,Ted:,"""It is not a company. It is a collective. ""
"
4,8,38,Barney:,"I know. ""We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower. ""
"
4,8,39,Marshall:,"Sweden, this is not France. You know that?
"
4,8,40,Barney:,"It's France. No matter, I told Bilson...
"
4,8,41,Barney:,"Bislon, saving your...
"
4,8,42,Barney:,"No, I get up, and I told Bilson...
"
4,8,43,Barney:,"Bislon, saving your...
"
4,8,44,Barney:,"Music. Imagine a patriotic music.
"
4,8,45,Barney:,"Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that...
"
4,8,46,Bilson:,"Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?
"
4,8,47,Barney:,"Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.
"
4,8,48,Barney:,"All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours.
"
4,8,49,Ted:,"You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?
"
4,8,50,Barney:,"It's not the best. We three, we'll work together.
"
4,8,51,Marshall:,"Ted will come to call.
"
4,8,52,Barney:,"Yes, totally.
"
4,8,53,Ted:,"What is it?
"
4,8,54,Barney:,"It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said...
"
4,8,55,Barney:,"Marshall, the teleconference begins soon.
"
4,8,56,Marshall:,"Sorry, I gotta go.
"
4,8,57,Barney:,"And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer.
"
4,8,58,Marshall:,"It's great. Drinking at work.
"
4,8,59,Barney:,"Basically, it is of ""Mad Men.""
"
4,8,60,Marshall:,"Yes! There is too much ""Mad Men""!
"
4,8,61,Barney:,"I'll spank a secretary.
"
4,8,62,Marshall:,"That's exactly what they would do in this series.
"
4,8,63,Barney:,"What series?
"
4,8,64,Barney:,"And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons.
"
4,8,65,Marshall:,"I do not do that.
"
4,8,66,Ted:,"I love to do that.
"
4,8,67,Barney:,"I will realize your dream.
"
4,8,68,Ted:,"Seriously, Barney, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me.
"
4,8,69,Ted (2030):,"It was true. You see, children, when I became an architect, I had a dream... contribute to building a panorama of New York. I wanted to point one of these buildings and say, ""See that? That right there? This is mine. ""This job was the opportunity to realize that.
"
4,8,70,Robin:,"Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19?
"
4,8,71,Lily:,"No. Believe me, it's not his style. She must not know what kind of place this is.
"
4,8,72,Jillian:,"We're here, my little p *** sexy! We just get served!
"
4,8,73,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,74,Lily:,"Oh, my God. At school, she is so calm and normal. I thought it was not... a Woo.
"
4,8,75,Ted (2030):,"What is Woo? Let me explain. Woo is a kind of a young woman, who, like the cuckoo and the nightingale, takes its name from its singular it produces. Also, a Woo can be triggered in different ways. On one particular song on the jukebox...
"
4,8,76,Jillian:,"My God, this song is my story too.
"
4,8,77,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,78,Ted (2030):,".. to a cheap shooter. On a ride on a mechanical bull... up, everything and anything.
"
4,8,79,Jillian:,"Oh my God, I was afraid of not having fed the cat, then I remembered that I had done.
"
4,8,80,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,81,Lily:,"I swear, at school, Jillian is not so Woo.
"
4,8,82,Robin:,"It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo.
"
4,8,83,Ted:,"Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.
"
4,8,84,Barney:,"Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless.
"
4,8,85,Ted:,"My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?
"
4,8,86,Barney:,"No, that's fine.
"
4,8,87,Marshall:,"Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos.
"
4,8,88,Jillian:,"My God, girls, my breast just out of my top bar. And no! I took it out for a drink blackjack!
"
4,8,89,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,90,Robin:,"So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it?
"
4,8,91,Jillian:,"If rewarding. I dunno if you know the RIE method, but it derives from the philosophy of progressive education Steiner founded the Waldorf school, which is... Oh my God, I love this song! Come on bitches, let's dance!
"
4,8,92,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,93,Jillian:,"You too, my ****** s.
"
4,8,94,Lily:,"No thank you... drag ignorant.
"
4,8,95,Barney:,"Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd.
"
4,8,96,Lily:,"You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.
"
4,8,97,Barney:,"Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist.
"
4,8,98,Lily:,"None of this stuff...
"
4,8,99,Barney:,"Industry shooters memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when ""Brown Eyed Girl"" happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And ""Brown Eyed Girl."" But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo?
"
4,8,100,Jillian:,"Who wants to name my tits?
"
4,8,101,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,102,Barney:,"Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine.
"
4,8,103,Ted (2030):,"The weeks that followed, I immersed myself in work. It was great to be on a project I really wanted to heart.Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived.
"
4,8,104,Ted:,"And we think this design will radiate timeless power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.
"
4,8,105,Ted (2030):,"I came out pretty confident about my chances.That evening I met Barney.
"
4,8,106,Ted:,"Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.
"
4,8,107,Barney:,"You did not have.
"
4,8,108,Ted:,"What?
"
4,8,109,Barney:,"The Board... Sven decided to choose.
"
4,8,110,Woman (in a limo):,"Wooo!
"
4,8,111,Ted:,"I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?
"
4,8,112,Barney:,"I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry.
"
4,8,113,Ted:,"It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.
"
4,8,114,Marshall:,"You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it?
"
4,8,115,Ted:,"I think I need it.
"
4,8,116,Barney:,"Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine.
"
4,8,117,Robin:,"It's been what?
"
4,8,118,Lily:,"Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day.
"
4,8,119,Robin:,"What?
"
4,8,120,Lily:,"You were seen to Woo.
"
4,8,121,Robin:,"Given that, do Woo?
"
4,8,122,Lily:,"You who did Woo?
"
4,8,123,Robin:,"I have not done Woo.
"
4,8,124,Lily:,"Oh, yes.
"
4,8,125,Robin:,"That's not true.
"
4,8,126,Lily:,"Your nose is growing. You've become best friends with Jillian now?
"
4,8,127,Robin:,"It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not.
"
4,8,128,Lily:,"Like what?
"
4,8,129,Robin:,"As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo.
"
4,8,130,Lily:,"I can Woo.
"
4,8,131,Robin:,"That's not true.
"
4,8,132,Lily:,"But if.
"
4,8,133,Robin:,"It's not you, that.
"
4,8,134,Marshall:,"Bilson? I just wanna say, I know that you chose Sven, but... Ted Mosby is extremely talented, and... he would have made a hell of a job.
"
4,8,135,Bilson:,"Yes. I voted for him.
"
4,8,136,Barney:,"It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free.
"
4,8,137,Marshall:,"Teleconference. Now.
"
4,8,138,Marshall:,"You wanna tell me something?
"
4,8,139,Barney:,"Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk.
"
4,8,140,Marshall:,"Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?
"
4,8,141,Barney:,"Okay.
"
4,8,142,Ted:,".. will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.
"
4,8,143,Barney:,"So?
"
4,8,144,Bilson:,"It was great. I like it.
"
4,8,145,Barney:,"It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see...
"
4,8,146,Man:,"I'm Sven Jorgensen. With me, there's Pilsen and Sven Sven Johanssen, and it is... Sven! You are the Goliath National Bank. You are at the forefront. You are new and fresh.Women want to be with you, men want to hurt you, but the fool who dares challenge you will be crushed! Your home office will show the world these facts. And one more thing... Do not look now! (It shows a dinosaur) Who is Barney Stinson, the head of the Research Committee?
"
4,8,147,Barney:,"Oh, my God. It's me!
"
4,8,148,Sven:,"You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power and virility.Your office will be here in the head of Tyrannosaurus.
"
4,8,149,Barney:,"I've never known so far, but I've always wanted.
"
4,8,150,Sven:,"On your desktop rosewood Honduras, there is this button.
"
4,8,151,Barney:,"What does this button?
"
4,8,152,Sven:,"Press! Press for the glory!
"
4,8,153,Barney:,"It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome.
"
4,8,154,Sven:,"There is a striptease club in the letter ""N"".
"
4,8,155,Marshall:,"What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small.
"
4,8,156,Barney:,"It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.
"
4,8,157,Marshall:,"You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.
"
4,8,158,Barney:,"It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall.
"
4,8,159,Marshall:,"""Fire Marshall"".
"
4,8,160,Barney:,"I have not even paid attention.
"
4,8,161,Marshall:,"How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.
"
4,8,162,Barney:,"I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons.
"
4,8,163,Marshall:,"No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.
"
4,8,164,Barney:,"Like what?
"
4,8,165,Marshall:,"Because, that.
"
4,8,166,Jillian:,"My God, girls. Yesterday, we collected $ 10 000 for my charity that fights illiteracy children. It's a real problem.
"
4,8,167,Robin:,"Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking!
"
4,8,168,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,169,Lily:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,170,Robin:,"What are you doing here?
"
4,8,171,Lily:,"The same things are funny as singles.
"
4,8,172,Robin:,"That's what the fireman's helmet?
"
4,8,173,Lily:,"I had no cowboy hat, and it was the day of fire safety at school... My God, ***** s. This is our theme.
"
4,8,174,Robin:,"Really? Who sings that?
"
4,8,175,Lily:,"LL Cool J stuff always comes out?
"
4,8,176,Barney:,"That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam?
"
4,8,177,Sven:,"I do not understand. Where is the call?
"
4,8,178,Barney:,"It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great.
"
4,8,179,Sven:,"It's a waste of time. Pumps!
"
4,8,180,Jillian:,"Misty, you're a real slut. We get another shot.
"
4,8,181,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,182,Misty:,"It's you, the slut, drag. It is you who pays.
"
4,8,183,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,184,Woman:,"No, ***** s, it is you who pays. You're too p *** a.
"
4,8,185,All:,"Wooo!
"
4,8,186,Lily:,"You are a bunch of prostitutes. You must have STDs.
"
4,8,187,Jillian:,"Come and dance.
"
4,8,188,Robin:,"Lily, it does not work. You should not be there.
"
4,8,189,Lily:,"I get it. Because I am happily married, I'm a schmuck?
"
4,8,190,Robin:,"On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his gun t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo.
"
4,8,191,Lily:,"You say that to make me feel not like an old married.
"
4,8,192,Robin:,"Look at those girls. Look at them and listen to what they mean Woo.
"
4,8,193,Woman:,"Wooo! (""I cry in the shower!"")
"
4,8,194,Misty:,"Wooo! (""I've never had a second date!"")
"
4,8,195,Jillian:,"Wooo! (""And if I was ever mother?"")
"
4,8,196,Woman 2:,"Wooo! (""I'm secretly in love with Jillian!"")
"
4,8,197,Ted:,"Wooo! (""My career and my love life going nowhere!"")
"
4,8,198,Lily:,"The poor girls... and Ted. I want to give them a hug.
"
4,8,199,Robin:,"Right now I am like them. I have no job, no boyfriend, I'm confused. So... occasionally, I need to Woo, but when I need to talk about something concrete, it is to you I turn. You're my best friend.
"
4,8,200,Lily:,"And you, mine. And I promise to dedicate ourselves more time. Marshall did not need to paste something from being done.
"
4,8,201,Marshall:,"You have tested those purple shots in test tubes? I took five. I believe that there is no alcohol in it.
"
4,8,202,Lily:,"Where did you get that hat?
"
4,8,203,Marshall:,"What hat?
"
4,8,204,Barney:,"It turned Sven.
"
4,8,205,Ted:,"What?
"
4,8,206,Barney:,"Those guys were morons. Of course, they had cool ideas... really cool ideas. In fact, I wonder if it's not too late...The fact is: you have the job.
"
4,8,207,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,8,208,Barney:,"The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy.
"
4,8,209,Ted:,"It's weird.
"
4,8,210,Barney:,"Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted...
"
4,8,211,Marshall:,"It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.
"
4,8,212,Barney:,"You know...
"
4,8,213,Ted:,"Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! (""Now, only my love life is a disaster!"") The next is for me.
"
4,8,214,Barney:,"Why you helped me?
"
4,8,215,Marshall:,"You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment.
"
4,8,216,Barney:,"You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall.
"
4,8,217,Ted (2030):,"Marshall eventually cracked and confessed the truth about Barney, like, ten minutes later, so much so that Uncle Barney attached to a mechanical bull, set to position ""Mixed Paint"" and it returned.
"
4,8,218,Ted:,"I love you, man.
"
4,8,219,Barney:,"Me too, buddy.
"
4,8,220,Ted:,"You mount the bull?
"
4,8,221,Barney:,"No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem.
"
4,8,222,Ted (2030):,"It was a rather brilliant night.
"
4,8,223,Man:,"three hours. This is the record of the bar.
"
4,8,224,Barney:,"That's right, girls.
"
4,8,225,Woman:,"You know what would be really crazy, funny and stupid to do tonight? If you and I, we found a guy to do it for three.
"
4,8,226,Jillian:,"Maybe... If we find the right guy.
"
4,8,227,Woman:,"Yes, and... if there is not the right guy, both could just...
"
4,8,228,Jillian:,"You know who is more cute? This guy, Ted. Come and get it.
"
4,9,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, it is believed all know how long it takes to recover from a breakup.
"
4,9,2,Lily:,"Half the time the relationship.
"
4,9,3,Marshall:,"One week per month spent together.
"
4,9,4,Robin:,"Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes.
"
4,9,5,Barney:,"You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!
"
4,9,6,Ted (2030):,"But you're beginning to recover when you meet the person who puts you in the game. This is the story of how I met this person. (Ted takes the elevator with a woman. She goes out and Ted is in the elevator) Children, if you go swimming, you immerse them directly. (Another, he finds himself again in the elevator with the woman) First, you dip your toe in the water.
"
4,9,7,Ted:,"Hi.
"
4,9,8,Woman:,"Hi.
"
4,9,9,Ted (2030):,"You take the temperature, to get an impression.
"
4,9,10,Ted:,"For me it's Ted.
"
4,9,11,Ted (2030):,"And you come back gently into the water.
"
4,9,12,Ted:,"I was left on the altar, there is one month.
"
4,9,13,Ted (2030):,"Or, you know, the bomb.
"
4,9,14,Ted:,"It was a complete disaster and since then I have not even managed to look at another woman. Except the old lady in the subway that makes break dancing. I look at it that way. I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it: These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?
"
4,9,15,Vicky:,"Yes.
"
4,9,16,Ted (2030):,"Children, I saw a bunch of crazy stuff on entering the apartment all these years.
"
4,9,17,Lily:,"Sorry guys. I'll just make a fruit cup.
"
4,9,18,Marshall:,"It's been 12 minutes!
"
4,9,19,Robin:,"Put it!
"
4,9,20,Man 1:,"You first!
"
4,9,21,Man 2:,"Why you referred me, Ike?
"
4,9,22,Ike:,"Do not say my name!
"
4,9,23,Robin:,"Ask your weapons!
"
4,9,24,Ted (2030):,"But one of the craziest things I saw happened when I was a roommate with your Aunt Robin.
"
4,9,25,Ted:,"You're who?
"
4,9,26,Ted:,"What are you doing, Mitch?
"
4,9,27,Mitch:,"You must be the roommate. I'm with Robin. She came out to take a call. I think its handheld gaming here.
"
4,9,28,Ted:,"Robin did not use the super secret signal. We put the old menu on the handle. This restaurant had to close. Mr. Popol...No need to explain why it's funny. I'm off. When leaving, take the pillow with you. This is a waste now.
"
4,9,29,Robin:,"I think I am more than qualified for the job. My weaknesses? I would say too caring, overworked, and I spend my career first. Oops! The latter is true. What?
"
4,9,30,Ted:,"Apparently, our sweet, innocent, little Robin led a lover. A young skinny named Mitch.
"
4,9,31,Lily:,"His thing arranged? A real disaster. She sent me text messages all night. She just let go to use the bathroom.
"
4,9,32,Ted:,"Excuse me one minute.
"
4,9,33,Mitch:,"Man, you annoy me. I am in action here.
"
4,9,34,Ted:,"What action?
"
4,9,35,Mitch:,"This is my technique. It's called, ""The guy with hair.""
"
4,9,36,Ted:,"""The guy naked?""
"
4,9,37,Mitch:,"That's the trick. You're the first date, you've had a few drinks, you go out an excuse to go to the girl.
"
4,9,38,Robin:,"The bathroom is. (His phone rings) You know what, I will respond.
"
4,9,39,Mitch:,"Then when she leaves, you undress and wait for you.When she returns, she laughs. She is so fascinated by your insurance, and your bravado she sleep with you.
"
4,9,40,Ted:,"No chance it works!
"
4,9,41,Mitch:,"Two out of three.
"
4,9,42,Ted:,"Two out of three?
"
4,9,43,Mitch:,"Two out of three. You just choose your moment. ""The guy naked"" mostly run as a last resort, the last resort to first appointment when you know that there will be no second.
"
4,9,44,Ted:,"How do you know?
"
4,9,45,Mitch:,"Look at me.
"
4,9,46,Ted:,"I'd rather not.
"
4,9,47,Mitch:,"Robin is not in my division. I'm not smart, funny and handsome. As you can see, there is nothing impressive nowhere there. My only chance with a girl like Robin, is the surprise. And let's be honest, a little pity. This is shock and ""Ohhh.""
"
4,9,48,Ted:,"It does not work really.
"
4,9,49,Mitch:,"Two out of three. Guaranteed.
"
4,9,50,Marshall:,"No December '.
"
4,9,51,Ted:,"Two out of three. He assured me.
"
4,9,52,Barney:,"Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers.
"
4,9,53,Lily:,"She'll beat him up, yes.
"
4,9,54,Marshall:,"It's going to take his gun and shoot him.
"
4,9,55,Marshall:,"My God!
"
4,9,56,Ted:,"It worked.
"
4,9,57,Marshall:,"The business returns for Mr. Popol.
"
4,9,58,Barney:,"""The naked guy"" works! It will revolutionize the blows of an evening! It's like the forward pass in American football.Dunk the basketball. This stuff barber where they hold the wick and cut above. It changes everything!
"
4,9,59,Lily:,"Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?
"
4,9,60,Barney:,"""The naked guy"" is more important than me and Robin. All these years, I broke my ass, with my secret identity, my laps and my gadgets. I mean, I'm Batman. But this guy is Superman. He tears his clothes and go.
"
4,9,61,Lily:,"What kind of gadgets you talking about?
"
4,9,62,Ted:,"So, it's going to be, a roommate? I come home, and guys with whom you will go out sitting on the couch, naked.
"
4,9,63,Robin:,"I can not tell you.
"
4,9,64,Ted:,"I can not believe that ""The guy with hair 'market has on you.
"
4,9,65,Robin:,"How do you say? I entered and he was naked. It was funny. I laughed, he laughed. And then it happened. I know not.
"
4,9,66,Marshall:,"I say ***** s!
"
4,9,67,Robin:,"Sorry?
"
4,9,68,Marshall:,"Sorry Robin, but cate with this type suggests that all that separates you from s*x, it's the clothes.
"
4,9,69,Robin:,"I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked.
"
4,9,70,Marshall:,"So, why did you lie?
"
4,9,71,Robin:,"Because... It... It... because I like Mitch. Much. There was a... connection specificity. Specificity and feelings.
"
4,9,72,Marshall:,"Because he was naked. Sorry, but I disagree. There is only one reason to sleep with someone, and it is ""love"".Marshall is a big girl because he believes in love and read ""And it was true"" because the secretaries were forced to join the Oprah book club. But you know I'm right.
"
4,9,73,Lily:,"Marshall, I love you, but there are plenty of reasons to lie.
"
4,9,74,Marshall:,"Cite me one.
"
4,9,75,Lily:,"I will quote 50.
"
4,9,76,Marshall:,"You could not.
"
4,9,77,Lily:,"Number one: last Thursday.
"
4,9,78,Lily:,"Marshall, you wanna do?
"
4,9,79,Marshall:,"I'm here.
"
4,9,80,Marshall:,"You have defiled the marital bed because you could not sleep?
"
4,9,81,Lily:,"It was you who said, ""This shadow on the ceiling, it looks an awful clown toothless. Good night, Lily. ""
"
4,9,82,Marshall:,"Okay! It makes one. But I dare you to...
"
4,9,83,Lily:,"I'll give you 50. There's s*x reconciliation... breaking s*x, and s*x ""a friend told you about a new position.""
"
4,9,84,Barney:,"You're welcome. There is also ""revenge"", ""bounce back"", ""parachuting"". When you're traveling, but instead of going to the hotel, you'll live in a bar to find a girl to get a foothold.
"
4,9,85,Robin:,"Oh, that, ""the kiss for a roof.""
"
4,9,86,Marshall:,"***** S!
"
4,9,87,Robin:,"I do not. My roommate in college did.
"
4,9,88,Marshall:,"No, Robin, it's just a bad cough. I'm not really a bad cough. We all know that the ""roommate in college,"" it's you, ***** s! Nobody has a Strepsil?
"
4,9,89,Lily:,"Oh, I have one. s*x ""bugger all on TV.""
"
4,9,90,Ted:,"The s*x ""hotel room"".
"
4,9,91,Barney:,"""Curiosity,"" style, ""Me have always wondered how to do this is with a great girl."" Big guy not a girl, just great. Like...if a normal girl was 2.10 m, 2.25 m high, and... wearing a mini denim skirt. I wonder how it is.
"
4,9,92,Robin:,"s*x, ""He says he loves you, but do not want to say the same.""
"
4,9,93,Lily:,"43.
"
4,9,94,Ted:,"""The co-pilot who jumps on the grenade to a friend.""
"
4,9,95,Lily:,"44.
"
4,9,96,Barney:,"""Condoms will expire.""
"
4,9,97,Lily:,"45. It gets a little tough.
"
4,9,98,Barney:,"46!
"
4,9,99,Lily:,"Still 4. ""You make a crisp fall on his knees and the when you picked up, he thinks it is an approach, and it happens.""
"
4,9,100,Marshall:,"Thanks for ruining the memory of the anniversary of our six months.
"
4,9,101,Lily:,"You gave me some chips.
"
4,9,102,Marshall:,"You can stop with this stupid list? You make me sad.
"
4,9,103,Lily:,"No, I have fun. But this thing of a ""partner"", it sucks sometimes. I always talk about you. I can not play ""I never,"" because everyone knows all the quirks that I let you do.
"
4,9,104,Marshall:,"The only oddity that I did was to open my heart and my soul when I had put me to hair when the room was empty.
"
4,9,105,Robin:,"I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked!Mitch and I have something special. My fingers are crossed.That may be correct.
"
4,9,106,Marshall:,"The good? Mitch? The guy naked?
"
4,9,107,Barney:,"You mean the naked genius. All this time I wore a suit when I should have removed it. That's it. I ""The guy naked,"" tonight. And you too.
"
4,9,108,Ted:,"What?
"
4,9,109,Barney:,"With the girl from the elevator. You're with her tonight?""Dude naked""!
"
4,9,110,Ted:,"This is the first girl I had the courage to invite, from Stella.
"
4,9,111,Barney:,"""Dude naked""!
"
4,9,112,Ted:,"This is the eighth place I try tonight! I cut my hair 3 times! I am out!
"
4,9,113,Robin:,"You're makeup?
"
4,9,114,Ted:,"It's not the makeup! It is a sun cream with a subtle shade of... It is for men. It's good, I want my eyes stand out.
"
4,9,115,Barney:,"""Dude naked""!
"
4,9,116,Ted:,"No, Barney, I like Vicky. It could be serious. I want to do anything stupid to jeopardize that.
"
4,9,117,Barney:,"I really like... this girl, but... I had not seen from behind. I really like... this girl. And I am willing to compromise our future for a night of glory. ""Dude naked""!
"
4,9,118,Ted (2030):,"That night we all had something to prove. Robin wanted to defend his honor.
"
4,9,119,Robin (on phone):,"Mitch, baby, that's me. Robin. Want to grab something to eat tonight? Because you're my boyfriend!
"
4,9,120,Ted (2030):,"Lily needed to prove she could finish his list.
"
4,9,121,Lily:,"I'm stuck. I find it the last 2.
"
4,9,122,Marshall:,"Reason 48: ""To reinforce good behavior, such as shaving or dental hygiene."" Now you conditioned me? Great!That's why I have an erection when I go floss.
"
4,9,123,Ted (2030):,"I had to prove that as scary as it may be out, Stella and I had forgotten I was ready to return. (Barney from the bar with a woman) And Barney had to prove that he too could be ""The guy naked.""
"
4,9,124,Barney:,"Thanks for letting me see your aquarium. You save my life.
"
4,9,125,Woman:,"Sure, no problem.
"
4,9,126,Barney:,"I just go to the bathroom and I'm off. Ted, I do. I ""The guy naked""!
"
4,9,127,Ted:,"Me too!
"
4,9,128,Barney:,"You...
"
4,9,129,Ted:,"I do. I ""The guy naked""!
"
4,9,130,Barney:,"It's great! Why did you change your mind?
"
4,9,131,Ted:,"The evening started well, but... not as good as I hoped.
"
4,9,132,Vicky:,"Oh, my God! Ted, you're so funny! And I can tell you that you have beautiful eyes.
"
4,9,133,Ted:,"What, this old stuff?
"
4,9,134,Vicky:,"Well done, hothead.
"
4,9,135,Server:,"I'm sorry.
"
4,9,136,Vicky:,"Stop! Go and tell the director he owes us an entry. One of those with shrimp! Nothing. You were saying? And then his cane missed the last step and fell, while, I swear, at least 2 minutes. God, I love old.
"
4,9,137,Ted:,"When I realized that there was no future in this relationship, I decided to do.
"
4,9,138,Barney:,"Great! OK, the important question: What will your pose ""naked guy""?
"
4,9,139,Ted:,"It's a good question. I have not really thought.
"
4,9,140,Barney:,"I thought ""Superman.""
"
4,9,141,Ted:,"And the ""Captain Morgan""?
"
4,9,142,Barney:,"And ""Oops, I did not have you seen?""
"
4,9,143,Ted:,"The Thinker?
"
4,9,144,Barney:,"And the Heisman?
"
4,9,145,Ted:,"Mr. Clean?
"
4,9,146,Barney:,"The ""Burt Reynolds"".
"
4,9,147,Robin:,"It's a pleasure to see you again. I really enjoyed it last night. So how does it feel to hold a Pizza Hut? Who had the idea to put a pineapple in the...
"
4,9,148,Mitch:,"OK, enough. I know what it is. I have already given. This is the hot date ""I'm not a ***** s"".
"
4,9,149,Robin:,"What? It's crazy. Usually, you see clearly in my game, but there you are mistaken.
"
4,9,150,Mitch:,"C'mon, Robin. One of us has had a good time, and you know it's me.
"
4,9,151,Mitch:,"Really? How was the s*x?
"
4,9,152,Robin:,"I have not hated.
"
4,9,153,Mitch:,"Did you see my technique. That's it. I have nothing to offer you. I am ruined, I sweat when I eat, and I'm in fantasy football leagues 5. I talking about it. Believe me, you want to be.
"
4,9,154,Robin:,"What? Of course I do! I did not sleep with you just because you were naked.
"
4,9,155,Mitch:,"But if. And now you pretend that it was more to feel better. Say what you want, at least ""The naked guy"" is honest.
"
4,9,156,Ted:,"What do you think of the good old ""Baby Cadum""?
"
4,9,157,Barney:,"The Olympic gymnast successful landing.
"
4,9,158,Ted:,"I gotta go.
"
4,9,159,Barney:,"""Dude naked""!
"
4,9,160,Ted:,"It's nice home!
"
4,9,161,Vicky:,"Thank you, from you, it's a real compliment. I love you to be an architect, it's fascinating. I could listen to you talk about design structures all night.
"
4,9,162,Ted (2030):,"This is where I saw, lying on the table, a book of love poems by Pablo Neruda. The same issue I had in college. And the bookmark was my favorite poem. Maybe I was wrong about this girl. It was perhaps a future.
"
4,9,163,Ted:,"Damn!
"
4,9,164,Vicky:,"And that's it.
"
4,9,165,Ted:,"Pablo Neruda.
"
4,9,166,Vicky:,"Yeah, this book is a sh1t. An idiot with whom I left it out there. This is in Mexico. (She returns to the kitchen) You know who writes good poems? Jewel. She has rotten teeth and she lives in a car. It has stuff to tell.
"
4,9,167,Ted:,"""The naked guy"" works! I just sleep with a horrible person. I'm back!
"
4,9,168,Marshall:,"Congratulations, buddy.
"
4,9,169,Ted:,"You're not the only one who provided e ""Dude-haired.""
"
4,9,170,Marshall:,"You just want to do to change the subject.
"
4,9,171,Lily:,"Hey, it's 49! It worked?
"
4,9,172,Marshall:,"As if I had just flossing.
"
4,9,173,Lily:,"I love you.
"
4,9,174,Marshall:,"It's been 50.
"
4,9,175,Ted:,"Pretty! What made you ask?
"
4,9,176,Lily:,"It's ""I have breasts.""
"
4,9,177,Marshall:,"right on target.
"
4,9,178,Ted:,"My God! Guys, guys! That's him! This is ""The guy naked""!
"
4,9,179,Robin:,"Ted, his name is Mitch. And... this is my boyfriend. So...
"
4,9,180,Marshall:,"Okay, I'll treat you more ***** s.
"
4,9,181,Robin:,"Okay you can go. It's over.
"
4,9,182,Mitch:,"Thank you.
"
4,9,183,Ted:,"Wait, Mitch, I have to thank you. We all tried ""The guy naked,"" tonight.
"
4,9,184,Marshall:,"We should see what is Barney.
"
4,9,185,Woman:,"Hello?
"
4,9,186,Marshall:,"Hi, Barney's there?
"
4,9,187,Woman:,"No.
"
4,9,188,Woman:,"My God. What is your problem? Vire!
"
4,9,189,Barney:,"I take my costume. It is expensive. Just tie...
"
4,9,190,Woman:,"Get out, now! Releases, you ugly whack!
"
4,9,191,Barney:,"Call me.
"
4,9,192,Woman:,"And if I see him, I called the cops.
"
4,9,193,Mitch:,"Two out of three.
"
4,9,194,Ted:,"I want you to know tonight, as crazy as it was, took me out of my shell.
"
4,9,195,Mitch:,"That's the beauty of the ""naked guy."" It gives you just what you need. Nothing more, nothing less. If you'll excuse me, I have to replace the shoulder of one of my quaterbacks imaginary football. He dislocated his shoulder!
"
4,9,196,Ted:,"A toast... Mitch. The sum of its parts makes him a man.But when it serves its parts, it becomes much more. It does not fit the definition of a hero, but he is the one I needed. The hero who helped me get over the disaster of the failure of my marriage and I was almost back in the saddle. He lives in the shadows. Is this a dream? The truth? A fiction? Damnation?Salvation? It is all that and also, no nothing. Because it is...""The guy with hair.""
"
4,9,197,Woman:,"My God!
"
4,9,198,Barney:,"thank you God.
"
4,21,1,Ted:,"Super. So I'll call you.
"
4,21,2,Woman:,"I hope so.
"
4,21,3,Marshall:,"Look at this.
"
4,21,4,Ted:,"I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.
"
4,21,5,Barney:,"Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.
"
4,21,6,Marshall:,"Yeah, it's true.
"
4,21,7,Barney:,"And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.
"
4,21,8,Ted:,"You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw.
"
4,21,9,Barney:,"You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.
"
4,21,10,Ted:,"This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him.""
"
4,21,11,Barney:,"Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.
"
4,21,12,Ted:,"My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?
"
4,21,13,Barney:,"Jesus.
"
4,21,14,Marshall:,"Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.
"
4,21,15,Barney:,"Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: ""Jesus, are you? ""And Jesus would probably have said,"" You okay? I died yesterday! ""And they would say:"" You have the air alive, man. "" And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, ""Okay, whatever you want, dude.""
"
4,21,16,Robin:,"The dialogues seem pompous old now.
"
4,21,17,Barney:,"And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.
"
4,21,18,Ted:,"I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.
"
4,21,19,Barney:,"And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.
"
4,21,20,Ted:,"Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.
"
4,21,21,Ted (2030):,"But I said nothing about texting. I started with something pretty and charming. ""I thought about you, then, I thought you send a text message piti."" By pressing send, I realized that it was not at all charming. That was the thing that sucks the most anyone has told someone. And the worst with texting, is that once sent... can not recover them. And then...(23 minutes later...) you wait. And just when you decided to never again send a text message... (His phone rings) ""I thought you too, it's crazy that you send me a text when I'm in my bath.""
"
4,21,22,Robin:,"What was that?
"
4,21,23,Ted:,"What?
"
4,21,24,Robin:,"You made a noise.
"
4,21,25,Ted:,"This is my laptop, a text message.
"
4,21,26,Robin:,"Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.
"
4,21,27,Ted:,"What?
"
4,21,28,Robin:,"When you see a naked girl, you make noise.
"
4,21,29,Ted:,"That's not true.
"
4,21,30,Robin:,"Really?
"
4,21,31,Ted:,"Sorry, Lily.
"
4,21,32,Voice:,"While the men hunt, women of the Korowai tribe native wash their clothes in the river.
"
4,21,33,Ted:,"It's a breast.
"
4,21,34,Robin:,"This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?
"
4,21,35,Ted:,"To call. Texting, it's different.
"
4,21,36,Robin:,"Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl.
"
4,21,37,Ted:,"I make no noise.
"
4,21,38,Robin:,"Really?
"
4,21,39,Ted (2030):,"Holly and I, we had sent text messages until 2am.And all the next day, too. It seemed perfect.
"
4,21,40,Ted:,"Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.
"
4,21,41,Robin:,"Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you.
"
4,21,42,Ted:,"How do you know?
"
4,21,43,Robin:,"Because no woman in history has never, ""asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. ""
"
4,21,44,Ted:,"Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.
"
4,21,45,Robin:,"What?
"
4,21,46,Ted:,"She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.
"
4,21,47,Robin:,"""Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. ""Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill.
"
4,21,48,Ted:,"Come down.
"
4,21,49,Robin:,"""And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.""Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry.
"
4,21,50,Robin:,"Hi guys! What is it?
"
4,21,51,Marshall:,"A meal that I Generro back to Lily.
"
4,21,52,Robin:,"Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!
"
4,21,53,Barney:,"What?
"
4,21,54,Robin:,"You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?
"
4,21,55,Barney:,"We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.
"
4,21,56,Marshall:,"We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.
"
4,21,57,Barney:,"""Piti texting""?
"
4,21,58,Marshall:,"Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.
"
4,21,59,Barney:,"Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.
"
4,21,60,Marshall:,"It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.
"
4,21,61,Barney:,"It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy.
"
4,21,62,Marshall:,"It's better.
"
4,21,63,Ted:,"I wear them right now and they are very sexy.
"
4,21,64,Barney:,"He put the boots!
"
4,21,65,Marshall:,"He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.
"
4,21,66,Barney:,"Or... we remove our shirts.
"
4,21,67,Marshall:,"It's better.
"
4,21,68,Barney:,"Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.
"
4,21,69,Marshall:,"I believe that wearing anything underneath.
"
4,21,70,Barney:,"It is hot.
"
4,21,71,Marshall:,"There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!
"
4,21,72,Barney:,"Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?
"
4,21,73,Marshall:,"I think we'll... have s*x with Ted.
"
4,21,74,Robin:,"You did this all day? This is wicked.
"
4,21,75,Marshall:,"No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.
"
4,21,76,Barney:,"The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything.""
"
4,21,77,Marshall:,"The same he had with you the first time.
"
4,21,78,Barney:,"We all know what it gave.
"
4,21,79,Ted:,"I'm in love with you.
"
4,21,80,Robin:,"What?
"
4,21,81,Robin:,"I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash: detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean.
"
4,21,82,Marshall:,"It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her.
"
4,21,83,Barney:,"And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.
"
4,21,84,Marshall:,"First: he jokes with the marriage.
"
4,21,85,Barney:,"""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? ""
"
4,21,86,Marshall:,"Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.
"
4,21,87,Barney:,"""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. ""
"
4,21,88,Marshall:,"Third: it says too early personal things.
"
4,21,89,Barney:,"""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. ""
"
4,21,90,Robin:,"And he really knows not what means MDR.
"
4,21,91,Marshall:,"Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought.
"
4,21,92,Barney:,"And then we met Stan.
"
4,21,93,Stan:,"Why do you so much noise?
"
4,21,94,Marshall:,"So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating.
"
4,21,95,Stan:,"Why not say you know it's there, thinking of you, concerned about you, and you feel safe? Your fears, your past disappear. And that the only hope is the promise of a hug.
"
4,21,96,Robin:,"Super Stan. Who is it?
"
4,21,97,Barney:,"A guard who works nights.
"
4,21,98,Marshall:,"He eats here every day.
"
4,21,99,Barney:,"And he had not finished.
"
4,21,100,Marshall:,"Far from it.
"
4,21,101,Stan:,"I thank God for every mistake I made, because each of them told me the path that led me to you.
"
4,21,102,Marshall:,"It's... really nice.
"
4,21,103,Barney:,"No matter. It's OK.
"
4,21,104,Holly:,"""And when, finally, we will be together, I want you to enlaces. ""
"
4,21,105,Stan:,"Hug me all night. Stroking my hair. Tell me I'm a woman and show me that you are a man. Until there is now. You and me... and now.
"
4,21,106,Marshall:,"You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.
"
4,21,107,Holly:,"""I do not ask someone to explain the night. I wait and it envelops me. And you're like bread, light and shadow. ""
"
4,21,108,Stan:,"This is Pablo Neruda.
"
4,21,109,Marshall:,"I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.
"
4,21,110,Barney:,"Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you.
"
4,21,111,Stan:,"That's cool. Still nothing?
"
4,21,112,Marshall:,"It is perhaps not in love with us.
"
4,21,113,Barney:,"How is this possible? It's all there waiting!
"
4,21,114,Marshall:,"I do not understand men.
"
4,21,115,Stan:,"I go to work.
"
4,21,116,Marshall:,"Do... you come back?
"
4,21,117,Stan:,"I'll be back when the wind, destiny and luck will take me back. That is to say tomorrow. This is the day of the cheesesteak.
"
4,21,118,Robin:,"That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?
"
4,21,119,Barney:,"All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.
"
4,21,120,Robin:,"It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?
"
4,21,121,Barney:,"Yes. (Barney out of the bar) Or...
"
4,21,122,Ted:,"Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now.
"
4,21,123,Robin:,"Really? How she explained the scope of texting?
"
4,21,124,Ted:,"Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy.
"
4,21,125,Robin:,"Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled.
"
4,21,126,Ted:,"And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl.
"
4,21,127,Robin:,"You cling to Barney and Marshall.
"
4,21,128,Ted:,"What?
"
4,21,129,Robin:,"They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall.
"
4,21,130,Ted:,"Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?
"
4,21,131,Robin:,"I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.
"
4,21,132,Ted:,"It's true.
"
4,21,133,Robin:,"Yes, it was them.
"
4,21,134,Ted:,"Incredible!
"
4,21,135,Robin:,"I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.
"
4,21,136,Ted:,"Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.
"
4,21,137,Robin:,"I see. Why not: ""I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live""?
"
4,21,138,Ted:,"Not bad. And: ""I killed a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface""?
"
4,21,139,Robin:,"I love this thing someone said about three months to live.
"
4,21,140,Ted:,"""I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. ""
"
4,21,141,Robin:,"It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live.
"
4,21,142,Ted:,"Wait. I think I have.
"
4,21,143,Marshall:,"He replied! ""I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. ""
"
4,21,144,Barney:,"That's it, man. This is the ""I love you.""
"
4,21,145,Marshall:,"I would like Stan to be there.
"
4,21,146,Barney:,"Stan. What?
"
4,21,147,Marshall:,"""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.""
"
4,21,148,Barney:,"""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. ""
"
4,21,149,Marshall:,"Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?
"
4,21,150,Barney:,"Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.
"
4,21,151,Marshall:,"Dude, I'm his best friend.
"
4,21,152,Barney:,"Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state.
"
4,21,153,Marshall:,"That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.
"
4,21,154,Barney:,"I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.
"
4,21,155,Marshall:,"Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he √©poustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?
"
4,21,156,Barney:,"I know. It's weird.
"
4,21,157,Barney:,"Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay.
"
4,21,158,Marshall:,"And by ""me"", he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams.
"
4,21,159,Robin:,"So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?
"
4,21,160,Marshall:,"Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?
"
4,21,161,Ted:,"It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.
"
4,21,162,Barney:,"You can tell us. This is a secure area.
"
4,21,163,Marshall:,"Your feelings are quite natural.
"
4,21,164,Ted:,"That's what happened.
"
4,21,165,Ted (2030):,"And I wasted half an hour of life of these bastards, tell them about this dream where I dine with my top 5 best architects.
"
4,21,166,Ted:,"Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, ""Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.""Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up.
"
4,21,167,Marshall:,"That's it?
"
4,21,168,Barney:,"No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?
"
4,21,169,Marshall:,"OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel?
"
4,21,170,Ted:,"Of course.
"
4,21,171,Marshall:,"So, the machines... killed everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?
"
4,21,172,Ted:,"And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you?
"
4,21,173,Barney:,"Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.
"
4,21,174,Ted:,"It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?
"
4,21,175,Holly:,"I loved that he called me right away. It's very romantic.And I do not assoies home to read architectural magazines uniformed cheerleader. I do it naked.
"
4,21,176,Ted:,"Holly and I are going to dinner.
"
4,21,177,Holly:,"I'll meet you outside.
"
4,21,178,Marshall:,"Sorry. It was just trying to help you.
"
4,21,179,Barney:,"And also, it was really funny.
"
4,21,180,Ted:,"I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an ""I"".
"
4,21,181,Ted (2030):,"I had proved that the Rule of Three Days was wrong and I went out to dinner with a pretty girl. And so far, I have told anyone the truth about this hot date.
"
4,21,182,Holly:,"It's funny! I also love indie music. We should get married. I laugh. Or not? I laugh again. That's it. We go to Brazil together! I saw my doctor this morning, he told me that everything was settled, so I can go. I think I love you.
"
4,21,183,Ted (2030):,"Finally, I did not have to wait three days, but Holly should really have. Like many rules, sometimes you follow them and sometimes not. But I will say this. When I was your mother's number, I called immediately.
"
4,21,184,Stan:,"Hi, friends.
"
4,21,185,Barney:,"You work right?
"
4,21,186,Stan:,"I took leave.
"
4,21,187,Marshall:,"Great! We can have fun!
"
4,21,188,Stan:,"I can not. I have a date. Ready?
"
4,21,189,Robin:,"Yes.
"
4,21,190,Barney:,"What...
"
4,21,191,Marshall:,"Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?
"
4,21,192,Barney:,"Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?
"
4,21,193,Stan:,"Friends. It's time to say goodbye. We all shared a special afternoon and it's something I cherish. I will never forget you.
"
4,21,194,Robin:,"You know their names?
"
4,21,195,Stan:,"No. The large, this is Ted?
"
4,21,196,Robin:,"No, it's Marshall. Married to Lily.
"
4,21,197,Stan:,"OK. Do you like chicken wings?
"
4,23,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, Stella was the girl I thought to end my life. Before she left me on the altar, breaking my heart. So, when I cross seven months later, I had only one thing to say.
"
4,23,2,Ted:,"Stella! Glad to see you again!
"
4,23,3,Stella:,"I do too.
"
4,23,4,Ted:,"And Tony! What a nice surprise.
"
4,23,5,Robin:,"""What a nice surprise""? No, a nice surprise would have been a safe falls from 40 stories e crushes them both. You let yourself do?
"
4,23,6,Ted:,"We had a friendly discussion and we resumed our respective paths.
"
4,23,7,Robin:,"You're f*cked up. He f*cked up, right?
"
4,23,8,Barney:,"Well played, sir.
"
4,23,9,Marshall:,"Well done.
"
4,23,10,Robin:,"What?
"
4,23,11,Marshall:,"You know, Ted has played cool, that's exactly what he should do. In fact, I would say on a scale of...
"
4,23,12,"Ted, crying:","And I kept your sweater... and sometimes, I sit in the bathtub for hours, you know, feel it.
"
4,23,13,Marshall:,".. up...
"
4,23,14,"Ted, with a lookalike Stella:","It's my new bride. This is Stella, except that it is French and, as you see, she has enormous breasts.
"
4,23,15,Lookalike Stella:,"Magic.
"
4,23,16,Tony:,"Enchanted.
"
4,23,17,Marshall:,"I think you've been great.
"
4,23,18,Barney:,"I would say even more. You, sir, did think Stella. ""Ted looked so cool now. Do I chose the wrong? ""Wait a week. The bush on the back. And belly. Have you felt that? There was an earthquake ""Tope-there"".
"
4,23,19,Ted:,"I am not on the back. Or stomach. I want to move forward.And it was an important step towards that. The future.
"
4,23,20,Ted (2030):,"And you know, I meant it. But anyway, that night, my mind wandered.
"
4,23,21,Stella:,"I made a terrible mistake.
"
4,23,22,Ted:,"I know. I'm better than you.
"
4,23,23,Stella:,"Bluntly. Ressortons lie down together and much more.
"
4,23,24,Ted:,"Sold!
"
4,23,25,Tony:,"Hi, Ted.
"
4,23,26,Ted:,"No, between. It's not weird at all.
"
4,23,27,Tony:,"I knew it was wrong to steal someone's girlfriend. I got used to it. I could not sleep. And for the wrong reasons.Sometimes for good reasons. Stella and I, we had not seen for five years, so you can imagine, at first it was fast and intense.Broken lamps, furniture moved. You see this bald area?Regardless, we turned the page. Me, Lucy, Stella, we would be moving to LA I was going to become a screenwriter. Then, you have been crossed, and you looked so... sad.
"
4,23,28,Ted:,"Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance.
"
4,23,29,Tony:,"You're wrong, OK? As a small dachshund with back pain who should be walking in a bag.
"
4,23,30,Ted:,"Why are you here?
"
4,23,31,Tony:,"I know I can be a bit harsh, but I can not bear to have you as many wounded. Fate put me in the street to fix it.Obviously, I can not fill the crater left by Stella in your heart.
"
4,23,32,Ted:,"I met lots of girls.
"
4,23,33,Tony:,"And I know you've been fired.
"
4,23,34,Ted:,"I switched to running a small business. This is the lung of the economy.
"
4,23,35,Tony:,"No. Ted, my family has a lot of money. And I want to use that money to fix it with you.
"
4,23,36,Marshall:,"Tony is rich? Tell me that you wrote a check. Tell me that you did a very big check. So big that he not remove his shirt to go swimming.
"
4,23,37,Barney:,"It's a very big check. IF big, that if you sleep with, you would not tell your friends.
"
4,23,38,Marshall:,"It's a very big check.
"
4,23,39,Robin:,"So big, that when you sit next to on the plane, you wonder if the check would not have had to buy two seats.
"
4,23,40,Marshall:,"It's...
"
4,23,41,Barney:,"A very big check!
"
4,23,42,Ted:,"Yeah! He has not signed a check.
"
4,23,43,Tony:,"Ted, I want to offer you a job.
"
4,23,44,Ted:,"A job?
"
4,23,45,Tony:,"Every year, my family gives a lot to Columbia University, I have contacts. How would you like to design...
"
4,23,46,Ted (2030):,"My heart jumped. A new library? A conservatory?
"
4,23,47,Tony:,".. your own resume as professor of architecture.
"
4,23,48,Ted:,"No thank you.
"
4,23,49,Marshall:,"What do you mean ""no thank you""? You'd be a great teacher. You are an expert, you can talk, and when necessary, you can get to grow a beautiful beard.
"
4,23,50,Ted:,"I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic.
"
4,23,51,Barney:,"Okay. Today, I had a $ 200 fine for speeding.
"
4,23,52,Marshall:,"That sucks, dude. You did not manage to blow it up?
"
4,23,53,Barney:,"You can not blow a fine.
"
4,23,54,Marshall:,"I have done. It was... when? In 1998.
"
4,23,55,Policeman:,"Where's the fire?
"
4,23,56,Marshall:,"There is no fire. In fact, you know, there's a fire in the barbecue where I go. Nothing special. Burgers, chops...merguez.
"
4,23,57,Policeman:,"You know it's dangerous to go... You said ""sausages""?
"
4,23,58,Marshall:,"Yeah, merguez. My mother's marinated in beer for 2 days. That's it. It's weird, I could have sworn that what those big, succulent smoked sausages had writing on it. Bizarre.You were saying?
"
4,23,59,Policeman:,"That was writing what? The merguez?
"
4,23,60,Marshall:,"It said: ""Ownership of Minnesota police, Jorgensen.""You like merguez, Jorgensen agent?
"
4,23,61,Policeman:,"You go to this address? Follow me with the siren.It will burn red lights.
"
4,23,62,Barney:,"I would have done that too, if I went to a barbecue.Slim, I went there.
"
4,23,63,Marshall:,"It's all in the assessment of your enemy. I knew he loved the sausages because he was out of breath just by coming to my car and he had mustard on his holster.
"
4,23,64,Robin:,"Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy.
"
4,23,65,Barney:,"You think I can not blow a fine? You think I can not blow my fine? I am Barney Stinson, master of manipulation. If I managed to make me pay for a stripper to dance, I can blow a fine. Challenge accepted... wait.
"
4,23,66,Ted:,"I understand. ""Ack-Ted. ""I understood.
"
4,23,67,Ted:,"What now?
"
4,23,68,Tony:,"You wanna be an architect? Super. A guy I was in school wants a new home. The job is yours if you want.
"
4,23,69,Ted:,"Tony, I do not need your help.
"
4,23,70,Tony:,"That's his job.
"
4,23,71,Ted:,"Now that's a very big check.
"
4,23,72,Barney:,"Let's go.
"
4,23,73,Police:,"Driver and vehicle registration.
"
4,23,74,Barney:,"Of course, officer. On.
"
4,23,75,Policeman:,"Sir, this is a gift certificate for a custom Italian suit.
"
4,23,76,Barney:,"So, what's good?
"
4,23,77,Barney:,"$ 375! And he kept the gift certificate. Emilio and I'll call him tell him to shorten the crotch.
"
4,23,78,Robin:,"You're wrong about that, man.
"
4,23,79,Barney:,"Anything, Robin. Like you've already blown a fine.
"
4,23,80,Marshall:,"Are you kidding? Robin is a pretty girl. They have no fines. I bet she was often stopped and has never had.
"
4,23,81,Robin:,"This is outrageous! And relevant.
"
4,23,82,Policeman:,"Permits and... Sweetie. No, do not cry. OK, not fine for you. Drive slower next time, OK?
"
4,23,83,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
4,23,84,Barney:,"Excuse me. I left something in New Jersey.
"
4,23,85,Robin:,"How was your lunch with the rich? It started well.
"
4,23,86,Ted:,"I want to design a home that showcases the landscape without dominating. IN 1935, when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house to the waterfall...
"
4,23,87,Man:,"Yes, that's fine. You will do a good job. My concern is the basement. Especially the laundry.
"
4,23,88,Ted:,"The laundry room?
"
4,23,89,Man:,"I want a laundry room of 5 x 5 meters, ceramic tiles stain-resistant floor to ceiling. I am a man who likes to do his own laundry, and sometimes it's messy.
"
4,23,90,Marshall:,"Gruesome?
"
4,23,91,Ted:,"Gruesome.
"
4,23,92,Man:,"steel chains hanging from the ceiling 3 meters. This is where my bags of laundry will be hung for three days and three nights before I... cleans.
"
4,23,93,Robin:,"Ted, it looks like this guy asks you to design...
"
4,23,94,Ted:,"A deadly house.
"
4,23,95,Robin:,"That's it. A house of horror.
"
4,23,96,Tony:,"By practicing martial arts, I learned to believe in my instinct and my instinct tells me that... it sounds great.
"
4,23,97,Ted:,"The steak is very rare.
"
4,23,98,Ted:,"Do not you?
"
4,23,99,Man:,"One last point, soundproofing. I tend to make much noise when I wash. I'll show you. I'll go in the laundry room and tell me if you hear me.
"
4,23,100,Ted:,"It's a bit serious, huh?
"
4,23,101,Tony:,"Grave well. You hit the nail.
"
4,23,102,Robin:,"You can not do this house!
"
4,23,103,Ted:,"I will not do.
"
4,23,104,Marshall:,"You can not do it!
"
4,23,105,Ted:,"I will not do it!
"
4,23,106,Barney:,"Come on. Mr. Officer, please, my wife is having a baby! She just lost the waters!
"
4,23,107,Policeman:,"Where is your wife?
"
4,23,108,Barney:,"She took the other car. It's Italian leather, so... I... go...
"
4,23,109,Tony:,"Sorry for this house of horror. It was my fault. It is for me.New plan. My friend, you will build a husband to the Statue of Liberty. I have some knowledge in the town hall.
"
4,23,110,Ted:,"Stop! I do not want your help, OK? You did not do that.
"
4,23,111,Tony:,"Yes
"
4,23,112,Ted:,"Why?
"
4,23,113,Tony:,"Because... when you were with Stella, I missed her terribly. I can imagine how you feel.
"
4,23,114,Ted:,"Let me reassure you. I do not want to Stella. She lied to me, dumped me at the altar. Who can do that? I'm better off without her. It is all yours, buddy.
"
4,23,115,Tony:,"Okay. A weight less.
"
4,23,116,Ted (2030):,"And that was all. Tony is gone and I started to put it all behind me. Finally, I thought.
"
4,23,117,Ted:,"Stella?
"
4,23,118,Stella:,"Tony left me.
"
4,23,119,Ted:,"Tony left you?
"
4,23,120,Stella:,"He said it was because of what you said.
"
4,23,121,Robin:,"You did break Tony and Stella? Really sorry, but I must insist that you topes there.
"
4,23,122,Ted:,"Let's talk in the hallway.
"
4,23,123,Robin:,"I'll wait.
"
4,23,124,Ted:,"Why are you here?
"
4,23,125,Stella:,"Look, Ted, I was 7 months late, but that's how. I'm in love with Tony, since high school. We went out for a long time, and then... I became pregnant and for a 19 year old daughter, it was too much to handle, and it broke. And for a long time, I too thought about my role as mother. I forgot Tony. I forgot...what it was like being in love. Then you came and everything was resurrected. And I loved you for that. I loved you so much, in fact, it was just... enough. But I always liked Tony.
"
4,23,126,"Woman, leaving her:","Take it back on, darling. He's sorry.
"
4,23,127,Ted:,"No, it's not what happens. Tuck, Mrs. Matsen. Delighted to have you review, Stella.
"
4,23,128,Stella:,"Can you talk to Tony?
"
4,23,129,Ted:,"What?
"
4,23,130,Stella:,"He'll listen. You made him change his mind. You can do it again. It is cruel to ask that...
"
4,23,131,Ted:,"Yes, it's cruel to ask it.
"
4,23,132,Stella:,"I do not know what else to do. I love it.
"
4,23,133,Ted:,"You love her? What, you do call my romance? It's your strategy? Because this guy is gone. You can have me over like that. I am attached to nothing, thanks to you.
"
4,23,134,Ms. Matsen:,"Come on, darling, kiss me!
"
4,23,135,"Stella, shouting:","Tuck, Mrs. Matsen!
"
4,23,136,Ted:,"Enter!
"
4,23,137,Barney:,"OK, you can do it. You can do it! You can do it.
"
4,23,138,Police:,"Driver and...
"
4,23,139,Barney:,"Licensing and registration papers.
"
4,23,140,Police:,"Pardon?
"
4,23,141,Barney:,"You must have a permit to be as pretty. And this body? I imagine that something as explosive must be registered with the authorities.
"
4,23,142,Police:,"Exit the vehicle.
"
4,23,143,Barney:,"Why, am I under arrest?
"
4,23,144,Police:,"No. It depends on what you will do me.
"
4,23,145,Robin:,"False. This has never happened.
"
4,23,146,Marshall:,"It's from a porno. I saw him. sh1t, I did.
"
4,23,147,Barney:,"When will you understand the difference between my life and a porno is that my life has better lighting.
"
4,23,148,Robin:,"You're lying.
"
4,23,149,Barney:,"I'm not lying! I swear on my mother. I swear Goliath National Bank. I swear on my costumes. I... do... mens... not.
"
4,23,150,Ted (2030):,"He lied. That's what really happened.
"
4,23,151,Ms. Matsen:,"Come on, darling, kiss me!
"
4,23,152,Stella:,"Tuck, Mrs. Matsen!
"
4,23,153,Ted:,"Enter!
"
4,23,154,Stella:,"I can not do anything to fix everything?
"
4,23,155,Ted:,"No.
"
4,23,156,Barney:,"It's me! This is Barney. With the help! I have big problems!
"
4,23,157,Ted:,"Slow down. What's going on?
"
4,23,158,Barney:,"I imagine that something as explosive must be registered with the authorities.
"
4,23,159,Police:,"Get out.
"
4,23,160,Barney:,"Why, am I under arrest?
"
4,23,161,Police:,"Yes, I did a search. You have 15 offenses of the past three days. Exit the vehicle.
"
4,23,162,Barney:,"No, my wife will give birth! I have a sausage with your name!
"
4,23,163,Police:,"Get out!
"
4,23,164,Barney:,"You must come to Brazzaville, in New Jersey to take me out.
"
4,23,165,Ted:,"I'm a little busy.
"
4,23,166,Barney:,"Come on. You have no idea what kind of criminals with whom they put me.
"
4,23,167,Boy:,"Let's get our painting?
"
4,23,168,Barney:,"Save me, Ted!
"
4,23,169,Ted:,"You wanna do something for me? I have to go in New Jersey.
"
4,23,170,Stella:,"You pay the toll, eh? I laugh.
"
4,23,171,Ted (2030):,"So, Stella and I went to New Jersey, to release your uncle Barney and we went home.
"
4,23,172,Barney:,"By the way, how's the girl you see? This superb French with huge tits?
"
4,23,173,Ted:,"You talk about Claudette? She is fine.
"
4,23,174,Barney:,"The highest good of all those with whom you're never out! Ever!
"
4,23,175,Stella:,"Again, sorry for everything. Actually...
"
4,23,176,Ted:,"I talk to Tony.
"
4,23,177,Stella:,"Really?
"
4,23,178,Ted:,"I want you to be happy. I will speak to him.
"
4,23,179,Ted (2030):,"And I did. I know what I told him, but he had to change his mind because the next day they went to California.Stella opened a new office. And against all odds, Tony became a successful writer. His film, ""The Bride"" was a hit. But we will come back.
"
4,23,180,Ted:,"Just tell me one thing. Why Tony? I mean, it's money, pajamas kung fu? Finally... What is it?
"
4,23,181,Stella:,"That is correct.
"
4,23,182,Ted:,"Good.
"
4,23,183,Stella:,"It's a little silly, but yes.
"
4,23,184,Ted:,"I will say out loud something that I had managed not to say out loud. Have you, Tony and you... That at one point I thought I had with you... I know that Marshall and Lily... I want that. I want to. I keep waiting and waiting for that to happen and... I guess I'm just... tired of waiting. And that's all I have to say about it.
"
4,23,185,Stella:,"I've already told you that I avoided a PV?
"
4,23,186,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,23,187,Stella:,"I was at my parents by doing 130 and I was arrested.The cop comes out of his car. He struts around a bit to me like, ""Girl, I've waited all day. ""Then I looked and I said,"" Sorry, Mr. Officer. I came as fast as I could. ""
"
4,23,188,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,23,189,Stella:,"An old joke. I know you're tired of waiting and may require you to wait a little longer, but it happens, Ted. And it happens as fast as she can.
"
4,23,190,Barney:,"She was found two days later, in the directory. I've never put my name in my underwear.
"
4,23,191,Barney:,"You're back!
"
4,23,192,Lily:,"When listening to this joke of peanut butter and jam, I was completely disgusted. But this morning in the shower, I thought about it and it made me laugh. Peanut butter. So I think I could win. According to Marshall.
"
4,23,193,Barney:,"It's good to see you, Lily.
"
4,23,194,Lily:,"Thank you. So what's new?
"
4,23,195,Barney:,"I'm in a world of amnesia with lots of pictures of my son and an alliance. I will find the best woman / woman and we will...
"
4,23,196,Lily:,"OK, that's enough for tonight. I'll go slowly.
"
4,22,1,Ted (2030):,"In May 2009, I was about to have my first big client as an independent architect. I was desperate for this to happen.
"
4,22,2,Man:,"That's what you want, son. It's very simple. Opening a restaurant called Rib Town and it is to have the form... a cowboy hat.
"
4,22,3,Ted (2030):,"Everything.
"
4,22,4,Ted:,"A hat? This is brilliant. I love it! Nothing better to say ""delicious"" as inside a cowboy hat. I tell you, I'm your man. I think being born to draw this building. I... I see.
"
4,22,5,Ted:,"I see it. I see it. (Robin enters) What is it good?
"
4,22,6,Robin:,"All-Nighter?
"
4,22,7,Ted:,"I told them I had a vision for this thing. They want a drawing in a week and I have nothing!
"
4,22,8,Robin:,"It's cute.
"
4,22,9,Ted:,"Cute? I can draw concert halls and bridges. Bridges so beautiful they could be in museums. And I could draw these museums. But I draw, what instead? Where is my career? A two-story Stetson... with a terrace on the edge. It's a cosmic joke. The universe conspires against me.
"
4,22,10,Robin:,"Did you just need to get out. Take a walk. Pay yourself a bagel.
"
4,22,11,Ted:,"Yeah, that'll solve everything. I have not slept for 34 hours, but a bagel is the answer. Cinnamon and raisin bagel with some cream. It looks good. I'll buy one.
"
4,22,12,Robin:,"Take an umbrella. It's going to rain, according Galoshes, our clown-weather.
"
4,22,13,Ted:,"Your show has a clown to present the weather? It's a bit nase, right?
"
4,22,14,Robin:,"And this restaurant that you draw, what form it, Hoss?
"
4,22,15,Ted:,"Okay. You want to fire me from here, I go out. I look forward to seeing what the universe has prepared me.
"
4,22,16,Ted (2030):,"Children, I tell you the story of meeting your mother. There is so much to learn from this story and it is most important. The greatest moments in life, it is not always what you do. This is also what happens to us. I'm not saying you can not influence the course of your life. You must act and you will. But remember that one day you could put one foot out and see your life changed forever. (He gives money to a homeless man) You know, the universe has a plan, children, and that plan is still moving. A butterfly flaps its wings... and it starts raining. (He opens his umbrella) It's scary. But it is also wonderful. All these workings of the machine running constantly, ensuring that you are exactly where you should be, exactly when you should be. The right place... (Someone taps him on the shoulder) at the right time.
"
4,22,17,Ted (2030):,"Children, it's a miracle I've been at this corner.Especially since it would have been easy I'm not there.
"
4,22,18,Ted (2030):,"For example, when leaving the apartment, I almost go right instead of left. Why not right? For that, we must go back. As you know, your Aunt Robin had a show.
"
4,22,19,Robin:,"Eunice is itself these handbags. They are hand-embroidered silks at best. And each takes months to do. I can not say how long... (Robin threw in a bag) Weather, fools!
"
4,22,20,Clown:,"Hi, everyone! A high pressure system arrives from the west...
"
4,22,21,Robin:,"On the other hand, I bought a big bag today.
"
4,22,22,Ted:,"Wait, why did you vomit?
"
4,22,23,Robin:,"You want to know.
"
4,22,24,Ted:,"Come on. Tell me.
"
4,22,25,Robin:,"I'm pregnant.
"
4,22,26,Ted:,"I will raise this child with you. You're not alone. You can get married if you want, but I want to see other girls, it would be one of those marriages...
"
4,22,27,Robin:,"Stop! I'm not pregnant. This is an intoxication. I ate something at the restaurant, three hours later, I vomited like a fountain.
"
4,22,28,Ted:,"Where?
"
4,22,29,Robin:,"This is a disgusting issue.
"
4,22,30,Ted:,"Where was your meal?
"
4,22,31,Robin:,"I want to tell you.
"
4,22,32,Ted:,"What?
"
4,22,33,"Barney, entering:","Go to YouTube. Tape ""Robin Scherbatsky show vomit"". Robin, already gone.
"
4,22,34,Robin:,"Someone has already put on YouTube?
"
4,22,35,Barney:,"Yeah... someone. So... why did you vomit? You're pregnant?
"
4,22,36,Robin:,"Yeah, I'm pregnant.
"
4,22,37,Ted:,"Why do you not tell me where you got your intoxication?
"
4,22,38,Robin:,"You adore this place. If I tell you, it will ruin it.
"
4,22,39,Ted:,"It makes sense. Do not say anything.
"
4,22,40,Ted:,"This Indian restaurant where the cat jumps on the tables?
"
4,22,41,Robin:,"I say nothing.
"
4,22,42,Ted:,"The Spanish restaurant with the cradle?
"
4,22,43,Robin:,"I say nothing.
"
4,22,44,Ted:,"Is it here? Tell me!
"
4,22,45,Robin:,"You really want to know? This is Schlegel's Bagels.
"
4,22,46,Ted:,"Why do you have told me? Schlegel's? Thank you! I'll have to find another New York place that serves bagels.
"
4,22,47,Ted (2030):,"The children, though as usual, I had gone to Schlegel's Bagels, I would have gone right. I would have taken a bagel would be returned to work on this building and you would perhaps never been born. But I went left, towards my second favorite place. And the rest is history. Of course, on the way, I stopped in this booth. Why I got arrested? That's why.
"
4,22,48,Barney:,"The Bro's Life magazine. Page 83. Look.
"
4,22,49,Ted:,"""What does your paintball on your personality? ""
"
4,22,50,Barney:,"Lowest.
"
4,22,51,Ted:,"""The last 3 kilos: how the push to lose. ""
"
4,22,52,Barney:,"Highest.
"
4,22,53,Ted:,"Petra Petrova.
"
4,22,54,Barney:,"The Girl of the Year in May, according to Bro's Life magazine. A delicate flower in stiletto heel leopard thong and riding a 4x4.
"
4,22,55,Ted:,"These magazines are broken. It is certainly retouched.
"
4,22,56,Barney:,"I have an appointment with.
"
4,22,57,Ted:,"You are my hero! Really? How did you do?
"
4,22,58,Barney:,"It's not in the story. I waited a long time to say that.This girl... is the daughter.
"
4,22,59,Ted:,"Of course it is. Marry them! It.
"
4,22,60,Barney:,"Marrying? I have something even more special in mind. Petra, if all goes well, will be my... wait, my 200th! Can not wait. Too exciting.
"
4,22,61,Ted:,"The 200th with that... get laid?
"
4,22,62,Barney:,"Who I'll lie. I want the highest ""Tope there.""
"
4,22,63,Ted:,"Even if I was wearing protective clothing. 200 is too much!
"
4,22,64,Barney:,"As if there could be too much of something wonderful.""Babe Ruth, gently, my grandfather. Do not hit too many home runs. Steve Guttenberg, you should not do that three Police Academy. America has laughed enough. ""
"
4,22,65,Ted:,"Who are these girls? It was rhetorical. Show me the list.
"
4,22,66,Barney:,"199 satisfied customers. Finally, the big night is Thursday. I give a reception before, in McClaren's. Prepares a toast. Tuxedo optional but desired. Gifts are, I would say useless, but follow your heart.
"
4,22,67,Ted:,"200 is too much.
"
4,22,68,Barney:,"It's not too much.
"
4,22,69,Ted:,"That's too!
"
4,22,70,Marshall:,"It's not too much.
"
4,22,71,Barney:,"Thank you.
"
4,22,72,Marshall:,"Do not misunderstand. You're disgusting and the cops should put a shoe on your part, but this number should be higher. After Barney told me about that, I reviewed the figures and... I have some graphics. Barney dredge about 20 girls a week.
"
4,22,73,Barney:,"It's more than 20. B. Does nothing more precise estimate.
"
4,22,74,Marshall:,"Let 20. So 20 girls a week, that's 1,040 girls a year.In its 16 years of sexual activity, it would mean that he has dredged 16,640 girls. If he has slept with 199, it's a success rate... slightly higher than one per cent. This is an average of 12 hits, eight times worse than average in career... launcher in one hand, the launcher... Jim Abbott.
"
4,22,75,Barney:,"Jealous. Jealous. Hero. Strangely silent during this conversation on his number of sexual partners. Hero. The grand total, it is the only number that matters.
"
4,22,76,Ted:,"Who said so?
"
4,22,77,Barney:,"Matthew Panning, the stud of Port Richmond College.
"
4,22,78,Matthew:,"Stinson, you're an amateur. I bet you've never done.
"
4,22,79,Barney:,"You neither.
"
4,22,80,Matthew:,"How many times I have to tell you? I did it with 100 girls. Fifth in school from my cousin in Long Island.
"
4,22,81,Barney:,"You know what, Matthew? One day, I would have done with 200.
"
4,22,82,Matthew:,"Call me when it happens.
"
4,22,83,Barney:,"And I'll call.
"
4,22,84,Ted:,"I think he'll say it again very slowly.
"
4,22,85,Barney:,"I will... the call.
"
4,22,86,Robin:,"You have noted Gaby Allan dual, 78 and 162.
"
4,22,87,Barney:,"What? Let me see. Sixty... Once. Oh, my God. Wait...I counted the same girl twice? That means I'm only at 198?
"
4,22,88,Marshall:,"It just means you're less than 0.5% was thought disgusting.
"
4,22,89,Barney:,"I win a Czech supermodel in two hours. I can not waste it in the 199th. Petra must be the 200th.
"
4,22,90,Ted:,"are you gonna do? You will find not a partner in the next 2 hours.
"
4,22,91,Barney:,"Astronaut Millionaire. You come home to see shells?
"
4,22,92,Woman 1:,"Get out.
"
4,22,93,Barney:,"I come from the grave of my wife. I buried her there was just one year. I miss her. I need comfort.
"
4,22,94,Woman 2:,"You're scary.
"
4,22,95,Barney:,"You're not as sick of all these games? I just want to settle down and have an army of toddlers at once.
"
4,22,96,Woman 3:,"I have a mass and I love to use it.
"
4,22,97,Barney:,"Marshall? Knowing how important it is for me, you think that Lily... I would do the job...
"
4,22,98,Marshall:,"I'll kill you.
"
4,22,99,Barney:,"Okay.
"
4,22,100,Ted:,"Where did Barney? It's been over an hour.
"
4,22,101,Robin:,"You know, looking at the names on this list, I do not see a lot of ethnic diversity. It should really be questioned.
"
4,22,102,Barney:,"It's done. 199 made of, more than one. Have you finished your drink? (He takes the ice in the glass of Ted and puts them under the table) That's better.
"
4,22,103,Ted:,"It has happened to you what?
"
4,22,104,Barney:,"There... a girl in the gym. Pauline. She runs after me for a while.
"
4,22,105,Ted:,"Why wait till then?
"
4,22,106,Barney:,"It's not really my type.
"
4,22,107,Barney:,"Good, Pauline. You're going to have all of Fonte Leveuse Sarasota Classic this fall. I thought... to you and me.And if you're still interested...
"
4,22,108,Pauline:,"Ok, this is the hour of cardio.
"
4,22,109,Barney:,"Good grief! Mom!
"
4,22,110,Barney:,"Every inch tasted like roast beef and creatine. But I did. I did and I still have 30 minutes before meeting with Petra.Robin, you have the foundation? I want to cover bruises and razor burn.
"
4,22,111,Robin:,"I hate to tell you this, but...
"
4,22,112,Barney:,"What?
"
4,22,113,Robin:,"You did the right Gaby Allan counted 2 times, but...you're also spent 138 to 138. Have you used the same number twice.
"
4,22,114,Barney:,"So that means... Pauline is not the 199th, it is the 200th?
"
4,22,115,Ted:,"Congratulations!
"
4,22,116,Barney:,"It must have Petra! Petra was to be the 200th!Beautiful, feminine, ""unrestrained power in bed"", Petra!
"
4,22,117,Ted:,"Go! Happened to you at 200. You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud. We do not care if Pauline does not pose in bikinis in magazines.
"
4,22,118,Barney:,"It does. She will be in the next Muscle Sexxy. And like many women in this magazine, Sexxy has two X and one Y.
"
4,22,119,Ted (2030):,"So, bagel on the way, I stopped a minute in a booth to see the photo of the 200th Barney. If I had not done that, I would have missed the cut by the booth and came 77th in this corner a minute earlier. I would have had the bagel, worked a little, and you children, you would not be born. Why I cut through the 77th and gave a dollar to the homeless? That's why. In the early days of Marshall to Goliath National Bank...
"
4,22,120,Marshall:,"Fran, I will not bother you, but I have a presentation tomorrow and it would help me if I could have tables and graphs. Can you help me?
"
4,22,121,Fran:,"This is the graphics department. We can make all the graphs, tables, in all colors on the paper you want.
"
4,22,122,Marshall:,"We'll have fun. (At the bar...) I ranked the presidents in order of disloyalty. A: Johnson. Two: Bush. Three Harding.Four: Polk. (At the apartment...) This circle represents ""Those who break my heart."" And this circle represents ""Those who constantly undermine my confidence. ""And where they meet: Cecilia. (Back at the bar...) This is a pie chart describing my favorite bars. And that is a graph describing my favorite pies.(Ted, Barney and Robin Marshall waiting for a response) What is it?
"
4,22,123,Robin:,"That's enough tables.
"
4,22,124,Barney:,"What about the graphics.
"
4,22,125,Ted:,"Any visual representation of data.
"
4,22,126,Marshall:,"I'm not stupid. I know what you think of my paintings and graphics. In fact, I made a picture of your reactions to my paintings. See it. Yes, that's true, since Cecilia, your interest in my paintings do not stop falling. But based on recent trends, I also... projection boards! And look... a large peak of interest is coming! And it's not just a blip dead cat. It is a long-term growth.
"
4,22,127,Barney:,"It's you, sustained growth.
"
4,22,128,Marshall:,"So, I prepared some charts to show how the setting up of a shell company in Bermuda could minimize our losses in the second quarter. And you avoid jail. To begin with...Excuse me a moment?
"
4,22,129,Ted:,"Mosbius Designs.
"
4,22,130,Marshall:,"What happened to my pictures?
"
4,22,131,Ted:,"They were thrown.
"
4,22,132,Marshall:,"What?
"
4,22,133,Ted:,"That's an intervention. You could not stop eating, so we threw your cam.
"
4,22,134,Marshall:,"Come on, Ted! I need my pictures! Only for today and I promise to never ever do. I suffered a lot of pressure. I need my paintings, Jack!
"
4,22,135,Ted:,"You make tables work?
"
4,22,136,Marshall:,"It's for work, idiot! I make a great show and if I have not these pictures, I'm gonna get fired!
"
4,22,137,Ted:,"Damn. Not move. I bring them.
"
4,22,138,Marshall:,"Magne! I will research how to wait. (Marshall back in the room) Sorry, there is a little late with the tables. But we'll begin in a moment. Fish are weird, right? I mean, what's their problem?
"
4,22,139,Voice:,"Tables! Buy your tables!
"
4,22,140,Ted:,"I'm sorry, Milt? I think these are my paintings.
"
4,22,141,Milt:,"These tables? On my coverage?
"
4,22,142,Ted:,"This is my blanket. We'll see later. But I need these tables.
"
4,22,143,Milt:,"Good thing they are selling.
"
4,22,144,Ted:,"Okay, how?
"
4,22,145,Milt:,"One million.
"
4,22,146,Ted:,"I give you five dollars.
"
4,22,147,Milt:,"One million.
"
4,22,148,Ted:,"No one will pay a million for these pictures!
"
4,22,149,Milt:,"One million.
"
4,22,150,Ted:,"OK, Milt, you won. I will give one million.
"
4,22,151,Milt:,"I'm urine...
"
4,22,152,Ted:,"The problem is that the distributor...
"
4,22,153,Milt:,"The alien time machine...
"
4,22,154,Ted:,"The alien time machine has a withdrawal limit. That's what I'll do. I give you a dollar... per day... for a million days.
"
4,22,155,Milt:,"It's... It's been 2700 years. It works! (Ted gives him a ticket and take the pictures) Big nase.
"
4,22,156,Marshall:,"Sorry, there is a star of earth? (Ted comes into the meeting room with tables) start.
"
4,22,157,Ted (2030):,"If I had not bought these tables for Marshall, I would not be passed by the 77th to give Milt his dollar. In short, you know the rest. And now, children. There are lots of little reasons that great things happen to us. If I knew then that these things take me and how I shall be grateful to them, I probably would have done something like that.
"
4,22,158,Ted (2030):,"The next day, Uncle Barney finally confronted Matthew Panning, the stud of the school of Port Richmond.
"
4,22,159,Barney:,"I slept with 200 women.
"
4,22,160,Matthew:,"My God! This is too much. Finally... It's disgusting.Have you thought of consulting as a s*x addict? You're the perfect candidate.
"
4,22,161,Barney:,"You've thought of consulting as ""I win, you lose""?Suddenly, your 100 girls in fifth, it is so impressive.
"
4,22,162,Matthew:,"100 girls? This is what it is? I lied!
"
4,22,163,Barney:,"Of course.
"
4,22,164,Matthew:,"I was 12, I was lying of course. I had no Ewok companion.
"
4,22,165,Barney:,"Of course.
"
4,22,166,Matthew:,"Your adult life is built on... something... on which I lied to 12?
"
4,22,167,Barney:,"Jealous?
"
4,22,168,Matthew:,"I get my kids to school. Looks like you got a lot of problems. Good luck, I guess.
"
4,22,169,Barney:,"I'm awesome. 200. Now what?
"
4,19,1,Barney:,"You believe not what happened last night laser tag.
"
4,19,2,Ted:,"People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?
"
4,19,3,Barney:,"Yeah, almost.
"
4,19,4,Barney:,"Go! You want that!
"
4,19,5,Girl:,"My shoulder!
"
4,19,6,Barney:,"Come on.
"
4,19,7,Pattern:,"Stinson, in my office! Now!
"
4,19,8,Barney:,"sh1t.
"
4,19,9,Pattern:,"Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!
"
4,19,10,Barney:,"I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!
"
4,19,11,McCracken:,"Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you.
"
4,19,12,Barney:,"You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.
"
4,19,13,Barney:,"My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.
"
4,19,14,McCracken:,"I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck shooting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!
"
4,19,15,Barney:,"You regret it.
"
4,19,16,McCracken:,"It's over, Stinson. You are banned for life!
"
4,19,17,Marshall:,"I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?
"
4,19,18,Barney:,"What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.
"
4,19,19,Ted:,"Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.
"
4,19,20,Barney:,"Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle.
"
4,19,21,Ted:,"Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.
"
4,19,22,Barney:,"No list of Murtaugh.
"
4,19,23,Robin:,"What is the Murtaugh list?
"
4,19,24,Ted (2030):,"The Murtaugh list was created around my 30th birthday. It all started with the beer funnel your uncle.
"
4,19,25,Marshall:,".. two, one, chug!
"
4,19,26,Ted (2030):,"In our 20 years, with each party, this funnel came out. And to our 30 years, none. Of course, at age 20, the day looked like this. (Marshall and Ted fight) But to our 30 years, the day looked like this. (Ted is sitting on the couch, the trash next to him) Then one day, in the suffering of the worst hangover of my life, I realized that one person in the world understood me: Detective Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover in the masterpiece 1987: Lethal Weapon, known for his often repeated motto:
"
4,19,27,Roger Murtaugh:,"I'm too old for this...
"
4,19,28,Ted (2030):,"Stuff. He said, ""I'm too old for this stuff. ""
"
4,19,29,Ted:,"It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night.
"
4,19,30,Marshall:,"I'm too old for this stuff.
"
4,19,31,Ted:,"Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.
"
4,19,32,Marshall:,"I'm too old for this stuff.
"
4,19,33,Ted:,"Or put posters on the wall without a frame.
"
4,19,34,Marshall:,"""Riggs. ""I'm too old for this stuff. In fact, it's Lethal Weapon?
"
4,19,35,Robin:,"I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is killed by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta...
"
4,19,36,Marshall:,"I gotta go.
"
4,19,37,Lily:,"Hi, baby. Good workout.
"
4,19,38,Robin:,"What? It's still one-man band? Because it was crap.
"
4,19,39,Ted (2030):,"In fact, Marshall was to coach the basketball team's class Lily. He thought it was funny, but Lily was dizzy: training father.
"
4,19,40,Marshall:,"My God! Orange wedges. That's nice. What are you doing here?
"
4,19,41,Lily:,"I could not resist. I wanted to see Marshmallow coach at work.
"
4,19,42,Marshall:,"The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?
"
4,19,43,All:,"Yeah!
"
4,19,44,Marshall:,"Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little sh1ts, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! Suicide, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.
"
4,19,45,Barney:,"There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.
"
4,19,46,Ted:,"Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.
"
4,19,47,Barney:,"Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.
"
4,19,48,Ted:,"And if you fail?
"
4,19,49,Barney:,"I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.
"
4,19,50,Ted:,"It works for me. Robin, you do the honors?
"
4,19,51,Robin:,"An agreement of honor!
"
4,19,52,Barney:,"Come on guys, you do it!
"
4,19,53,Robin:,"Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.
"
4,19,54,Ted:,"There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?
"
4,19,55,Barney:,"""To pierce the ear. ""Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. (Barney hand, then returned several hours later) Do you mind if I use your futon?
"
4,19,56,Robin:,"There is no futon.
"
4,19,57,Barney:,"Put it there, guys.
"
4,19,58,Robin:,"What's the matter?
"
4,19,59,Barney:,"It's on the list. ""Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. ""
"
4,19,60,Robin:,"I'm too old for this stuff.
"
4,19,61,Ted:,"You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.
"
4,19,62,Barney:,"What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, ""pushing a medical"" on the list. (His phone rings) Hold on. Bar here...
"
4,19,63,Marshall:,"It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things. (He throws the basketball on a kid) you not being there! You fall!
"
4,19,64,Ted (2030):,"The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room.
"
4,19,65,Barney:,"Done. (Barney is McClaren's) ""Drinking shots with strangers. ""Done.
"
4,19,66,Ted:,"OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.
"
4,19,67,Barney:,"No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth! (He can not drink his glass) You should have a straw?
"
4,19,68,Robin:,"There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?
"
4,19,69,Ted:,"This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.
"
4,19,70,Robin:,"It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey.
"
4,19,71,Ted:,"I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.
"
4,19,72,Lily:,"Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?
"
4,19,73,Marshall:,"I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow.
"
4,19,74,Lily:,"Winning? There are no points.
"
4,19,75,Marshall:,"What?
"
4,19,76,Lily:,"There are no points.
"
4,19,77,Marshall:,"You not count... What interest not to do? How do you know... Lily, what were you doing with the team before I arrive?
"
4,19,78,Lily:,"I was training.
"
4,19,79,Lily:,"That's my little angels. You are luminous beings of light.
"
4,19,80,Boy:,"What's the score?
"
4,19,81,Lily:,"Gender: joy joy!
"
4,19,82,Lily:,"Because that's the point of playing, having fun.
"
4,19,83,Marshall:,"The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy?
"
4,19,84,Lily:,"Everyone. This is a participation trophy, everyone has one.
"
4,19,85,Marshall:,"Everything that's Chinese to me.
"
4,19,86,Barney:,"Hi, this is Barney.
"
4,19,87,Robin:,"And Robin.
"
4,19,88,Barney:,"We can not answer because...
"
4,19,89,Robin:,"He watches football and I'm...
"
4,19,90,Barney:,"Part shopping. Leave a message, you are reminded...
"
4,19,91,Robin:,".. soon...
"
4,19,92,Barney:,".. we...
"
4,19,93,Robin and Barney:,".. can!
"
4,19,94,Barney:,"""Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.""Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay.
"
4,19,95,Robin:,"Your ear begins to feel.
"
4,19,96,Barney:,"It's good.
"
4,19,97,Ted:,"I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.
"
4,19,98,Robin:,"Okay. It's good. You have your own list.
"
4,19,99,Ted:,"What?
"
4,19,100,Robin:,"A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old.
"
4,19,101,Ted:,"Removes ""colonoscopy"" and ""sleeping with an old"", and is a cinch.
"
4,19,102,Barney:,"New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.
"
4,19,103,Ted:,"Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.
"
4,19,104,Barney:,"Bet held.
"
4,19,105,Robin:,"An agreement of honor!
"
4,19,106,Lily:,"Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that.
"
4,19,107,Marshall:,"Sure. I learned that way.
"
4,19,108,Lily:,"Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that?
"
4,19,109,Marshall:,"Come on, Dad. I'm tired.
"
4,19,110,Father:,"Sleep is for the winners. You go to bed when you get labeled.
"
4,19,111,Marshall:,"I'm trying.
"
4,19,112,Father:,"I give you two points for trying. But I take off two points because of your big head.
"
4,19,113,Marshall:,"With my father, no mercy and I did not ask. I really need to call this guy. Continue stretching!
"
4,19,114,Ted:,"""Put on reading glasses. ""Done. ""Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. ""With pleasure. (Ted was about to leave when Robin and Barney come but this box) What happened to you?
"
4,19,115,Barney:,"I just had a little ""screw up my knee and it hurts"" incident.
"
4,19,116,Ted:,"How did you do?
"
4,19,117,Barney:,"It... ""Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer.""
"
4,19,118,Robin:,"Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.
"
4,19,119,Ted:,"16 pm! Supper time.
"
4,19,120,Lily:,"Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes.
"
4,19,121,Marshall:,"Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children.
"
4,19,122,Lily:,"OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?
"
4,19,123,Marshall:,"There are different...
"
4,19,124,Lily:,"Is that clear?
"
4,19,125,Marshall:,"Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...
"
4,19,126,Barney:,"Ted Calls. I want to go.
"
4,19,127,Robin:,"Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened.
"
4,19,128,Ted:,"Got up at 4am... Done.
"
4,19,129,Barney:,"It answers?
"
4,19,130,Robin:,"I have not called yet.
"
4,19,131,Barney:,"Hurry up, Robin.
"
4,19,132,Ted:,"Okay. ""Take time to answer the phone. ""
"
4,19,133,Barney:,"Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was.
"
4,19,134,Ted:,"Done.
"
4,19,135,Marshall:,"I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun.
"
4,19,136,Ted (2030):,"Children, over time your Uncle Marshall rehashed the story this game hundreds of times. And in fact, children from the other team were older than one class. But harping on the story, they looked like that.
"
4,19,137,Marshall:,"Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not shoot! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?
"
4,19,138,Referee:,"I'm no referee, but Kenny. And watch your tone.
"
4,19,139,Marshall:,"No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later.
"
4,19,140,Robin:,"As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.
"
4,19,141,Barney:,"No, he remains a. ""The beer funnel. ""
"
4,19,142,Ted:,"It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement.
"
4,19,143,Robin:,"The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?
"
4,19,144,Ted:,"Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.
"
4,19,145,Barney:,"No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is killing me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.
"
4,19,146,Ted:,"You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal Weapon.
"
4,19,147,Ted:,"I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal Weapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal Weapon 4, I realized...
"
4,19,148,Ted:,".. that Murtaugh kept repeating: ""I'm too old for this stuff,"" but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.
"
4,19,149,Barney:,"And then the hospital.
"
4,19,150,Marshall:,"Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0.
"
4,19,151,Boy:,"What are we doing wrong, coach?
"
4,19,152,Marshall:,"You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun.
"
4,19,153,Ted (2030):,"Because they did not want to argue in front of children, your uncle and your aunt Lily Marshall had a telepathic conversation.
"
4,19,154,Lily:,"Do not look at me like that.
"
4,19,155,Marshall:,"I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy!
"
4,19,156,Lily:,"Stop yelling at me!
"
4,19,157,Marshall:,"I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way?
"
4,19,158,Lily:,"OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar.
"
4,19,159,Ted (2030):,"Was it the determination of Marshall, Lily of encouragement, or the magic combination of both, but in the second half, the disorganized group of little urchins... have actually made things worse. In fact, according to Uncle Marshall, in the second half, the other team had even grown.And one of them had changed into a werewolf.
"
4,19,160,Marshall:,"There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.
"
4,19,161,Lily:,"They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded.
"
4,19,162,Marshall:,"It was not a market, right? You're killing me! You kill me outright!
"
4,19,163,Kenny:,"Attention, coach, or I put a technical foul.
"
4,19,164,Marshall:,"I beg you to put me in one.
"
4,19,165,Ted (2030):,"When the final whistle sounded charitably, the score was, according to the estimate of Marshall, 118 to nothing. And even if they did not win, everyone, including the coach, received a trophy for participation.
"
4,19,166,Lily:,"I understand that you like it not.
"
4,19,167,Marshall:,"I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value.
"
4,19,168,Lily:,"I know, baby.
"
4,19,169,Marshall:,"Your way is perhaps not completely stupid.
"
4,19,170,Lily:,"Thank you. Yours is.
"
4,19,171,McCracken:,"My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.
"
4,19,172,Barney:,"Really?
"
4,19,173,McCracken:,"Good God, no! I call the police! Major cons with pink hair that dangle from the PQ. Are you kidding. I'm too old for this...
"
4,19,174,Ted (2030):,"Stuff. He said ""Stuff"".
"
4,24,1,Ted (2030):,"Each architect has a building that changed his career. For me it was to my 31st birthday. It was not a museum or a concert hall or a skyscraper. It was something else.
"
4,24,2,Man:,"We opened a restaurant called the Rib Town, we want it shaped...
"
4,24,3,Ted:,".. hat cowboy. Listen, I need this job. I have no other option.
"
4,24,4,Robin:,"You can always do prof.
"
4,24,5,Ted:,"I have not worked as hard to finish in a crappy job. Get me wrong, Lily.
"
4,24,6,Lily:,"I was pissed 3 times this morning. I can not say.
"
4,24,7,Ted:,"I pass this building, so I see you in three days.
"
4,24,8,Ted (2030):,"The next three days, I worked as ever. And it led me... nowhere.
"
4,24,9,Barney:,"What are you doing?
"
4,24,10,Ted:,"A hat-shaped building.
"
4,24,11,Barney:,"It's time to talk?
"
4,24,12,Ted:,"No.
"
4,24,13,Barney:,"What do you think of Robin?
"
4,24,14,Ted:,"I have to really work, so...
"
4,24,15,Barney:,"Awesome. Say that is a tailor and you have found a nice suit. A nice suit Canada. Superb chest. You try it, but it does not suit you perfectly. So you return it. Then I try it. I'm not too keen... a suit that you have caught the eye, but at the same time, I love this costume.
"
4,24,16,Ted:,"Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel.
"
4,24,17,Barney:,"But Ted, remember your answer, because... The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?
"
4,24,18,Ted:,"I'm with you.
"
4,24,19,Barney:,"Now. For I have explained.
"
4,24,20,Ted:,"What...
"
4,24,21,Marshall:,"Come on, man, you're on it for three days without stopping. This is your birthday. Come have a beer on the roof.
"
4,24,22,Ted:,"Impossible, the presentation is tomorrow. These hats are not alone.
"
4,24,23,Marshall:,"That's a big restaurant for tourists. Just put wide doors and chairs strengthened. Birthday beer on the roof. Let's go!
"
4,24,24,Ted:,"Why do you want as I go on the roof? You made me a surprise party?
"
4,24,25,Marshall:,"What? We brought you a surprise party, last year.Thou shalt have no surprises on two holidays. The fact that the world has come to the first was surprising. Not? Two surprises on Christmas! It is very strong! It is very strong! Great!(Marshall goes on the roof) Super... It still will not mount.
"
4,24,26,Robin:,"Come on. This is boring! I knew it was a bad idea.
"
4,24,27,Marshall:,"Yes, Robin, I know. This festival is... is... a disaster.It was my idea. I take responsibility. There is one thing to do.
"
4,24,28,Lily:,"Marshall, no.
"
4,24,29,Marshall:,"Lily, I have to! (He stands on the edge of the roof) It's useless to procrastinate.
"
4,24,30,Ted (2030):,"I should explain. A few years earlier...
"
4,24,31,Barney:,"Forget it. It really is not class. At best, it sucks.
"
4,24,32,Marshall:,"You know who knows how to live? These people.
"
4,24,33,Ted (2030):,"The terrace of the building next door. A paradise waiting for us behind a pit of 2 or 3 meters. And the best...
"
4,24,34,Marshall:,"It looks to be a... sacred... spa.
"
4,24,35,Barney:,"Owl. How do we go? We will do what? Jump?
"
4,24,36,Marshall:,"I can jump it.
"
4,24,37,Ted:,"Recently, you need two tries to get up from the couch.You can not skip it.
"
4,24,38,Marshall:,"Really?
"
4,24,39,Ted:,"Really.
"
4,24,40,Marshall:,"Look.
"
4,24,41,Ted (2030):,"But he did not jump.
"
4,24,42,Barney:,"Actually, it's not bad.
"
4,24,43,Ted:,"Right?
"
4,24,44,Ted (2030):,"And the following years, he continued to try. But each time, without exception... He did not jump.
"
4,24,45,Marshall:,"Do not worry. If I can jump tonight, it will save the evening.
"
4,24,46,Lily:,"Honey, come down here, please.
"
4,24,47,Marshall:,"When Evel Knievel rode his rocket star on the shore of Snake River Canyon, you think his wife said ""Honey, come down here '?
"
4,24,48,Lily:,"For the last time, I'm not Linda Knievel! I will never be Linda Knievel!
"
4,24,49,Marshall:,"No need to remind me.
"
4,24,50,Lily:,"Marshall, do not do that. Do not jump, please.
"
4,24,51,Marshall:,"Sorry, but I have to.
"
4,24,52,Lily:,"You can not.
"
4,24,53,Marshall:,"Why?
"
4,24,54,Lily:,"You want a reason? You're going to have one. I am pregnant.
"
4,24,55,Marshall:,"My God! My God, really? I saw you look fat...
"
4,24,56,Lily:,"I was lying, b*st*rd! Go ahead, jump! I hope u gonna die!
"
4,24,57,Marshall:,"This is the permission I needed.
"
4,24,58,Barney:,"Look, Robin... I must tell you something.
"
4,24,59,Robin:,"Wait. Before that, I must tell you something.
"
4,24,60,Barney:,"What is it?
"
4,24,61,Robin:,"I think I love you.
"
4,24,62,Lily:,"This is Ted. Everyone! Ted, are you?
"
4,24,63,Ted:,"She's here, Lily. She looks at me.
"
4,24,64,Lily:,"What?
"
4,24,65,Ted:,"The goat.
"
4,24,66,Ted (2030):,"I have already told you some of the history of the goat.
"
4,24,67,Ted (2030):,"When Aunt Lily a farmer invited to speak to his class how he brought the goat, and told the class what he would do later. How Aunt Lily, in a fit of kindness, bought a goat to commute his sentence.
"
4,24,68,Barney:,"It's been an incredible thing. I was talking to Robin, I would tell him my feelings, but just before, you will believe what ever she said.
"
4,24,69,Robin:,"I think I love you.
"
4,24,70,Lily:,"You said what?
"
4,24,71,Barney:,"In your opinion? What we can say to that?
"
4,24,72,Barney:,"Robin, you're great listening. You're really great, but we're friends. This is not a good idea.
"
4,24,73,Robin:,"You must be right. Have fun.
"
4,24,74,Barney:,"You too, sweetie.
"
4,24,75,Lily:,"What?
"
4,24,76,Barney:,"Once she told me that, more than feelings. I'm more in love.
"
4,24,77,Lily:,"You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more.
"
4,24,78,Barney:,"It's not great?
"
4,24,79,Ted:,"It's a wuss. Not food. (He takes the mop in the bathroom and closes the door behind him) How...?
"
4,24,80,Marshall:,"It is. It... is... go! It is.
"
4,24,81,Barney:,"Tracey, tell Lily what you just said.
"
4,24,82,Tracey:,"What I just arrived in New York?
"
4,24,83,Barney:,"No, how you've arrived there.
"
4,24,84,Tracey:,"I just get off the bus from Iowa.
"
4,24,85,Barney:,"Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes?
"
4,24,86,Tracey:,"I believe in a classic story of showbiz.
"
4,24,87,Lily:,"Honey, you're there. You're really there.
"
4,24,88,Barney:,"You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much?
"
4,24,89,Tracey:,"Of course!
"
4,24,90,Lily:,"Damn.
"
4,24,91,Barney:,"What?
"
4,24,92,Lily:,"Everyone always says, ""Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. ""And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret. And here you come with that crap and you force me to become the Lily will spill the beans!
"
4,24,93,Barney:,"What song? There was a piece?
"
4,24,94,Lily:,"There was a song.
"
4,24,95,Barney:,"The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?
"
4,24,96,Ted:,"I'm with you.
"
4,24,97,Barney:,"Now. As I explained...
"
4,24,98,Ted:,"What...
"
4,24,99,Robin:,"sh1t.
"
4,24,100,Lily:,"He said that? My God! What an incredible surprise!
"
4,24,101,Robin:,"You know since when?
"
4,24,102,Robin:,"And you've said anything since? Bravo.
"
4,24,103,Marshall:,"Bravo, Lily. I mean, what a bomb. Who saw this coming?
"
4,24,104,Robin:,"You know since when?
"
4,24,105,Marshall:,"7 months and 29 days.
"
4,24,106,Robin:,"I will do what?
"
4,24,107,Lily:,"I know. Are you gonna do?
"
4,24,108,Robin:,"I'll marry Barney in a large church. We'll move to New Hampshire and open cottages.
"
4,24,109,Marshall:,"Really?
"
4,24,110,Robin:,"No! This is Barney. I mean... This is Barney. But it's Barney. I have to say no.
"
4,24,111,Lily:,"Boy, you're going to break her... The thing that this black mud pump through his veins.
"
4,24,112,Robin:,"You're right. For the first time he likes a girl, she pushes him away? And not just any girl. It's going to destroy it.
"
4,24,113,Marshall:,"OK, first... Second, there is a trick you can try. It's risky, but it can pay off. Lack of anything better, I'll call it... The Mosby.
"
4,24,114,Robin:,"The Mosby?
"
4,24,115,Lily:,"No, she can not mosbyser.
"
4,24,116,Marshall:,"It could squarely mosbyser.
"
4,24,117,Robin:,"What is the Mosby?
"
4,24,118,Marshall:,"Do you remember your first time with Ted? You wanted to get on the train Ted, visit his yard.
"
4,24,119,Robin:,"I was ready to jump the turnstile.
"
4,24,120,Marshall:,"What changed everything?
"
4,24,121,Ted:,"I think I love you.
"
4,24,122,Robin:,"What?
"
4,24,123,Robin:,"The Mosby! It's great! And... excuse me.
"
4,24,124,Marshall:,"You're really pretty, but abnormally high and you will not believe in ghosts.
"
4,24,125,Barney:,"So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise.
"
4,24,126,Lily:,"That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.
"
4,24,127,Barney:,"Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great. (Tracey returns) So Robin does not like me.
"
4,24,128,Lily:,"No.
"
4,24,129,Barney:,"Why?
"
4,24,130,Ted:,"Mr. Goat? (He tries to open the bathroom but the door is closed) M. The goat? Enough. (He manages to enter) Crazy Goat. I do not understand your fascination with this mop. It should be normal with a brain the size of a...
"
4,24,131,Lily:,"Marshall, you can pick up Ted?
"
4,24,132,Marshall:,"I was about to jump. You've not heard saying ""OK"" loop?
"
4,24,133,Lily:,"I'm sorry. Go ahead and jump.
"
4,24,134,Marshall:,"It's good. Sorry, everyone. Lily does not want me jumping. (He descends from the rim) Thank God.
"
4,24,135,Ted:,"The hospital!
"
4,24,136,Lily:,"What has happened?
"
4,24,137,Ted:,"It happened... you left a wild animal in our apartment. I've been attacked.
"
4,24,138,Lily:,"This is the sweetest and adorable goat in the world.
"
4,24,139,Ted:,"""The sweetest and adorable goat in the world""?
"
4,24,140,Ted (2030):,"I lacked sleep, it was certainly not like that, but that's how I remember it.
"
4,24,141,Doctor:,"You're the one who wanted to be a goat?
"
4,24,142,Ted:,"It's the goat jumped on me! Can I go?
"
4,24,143,Doctor:,"Yes. But remember, ""Bee"" means ""bee"".
"
4,24,144,Ted:,"Great, I'm late for my presentation. Thank you, Mr. Goat.
"
4,24,145,Lily:,"Mr. Goat? It's a girl. Her name is Missy.
"
4,24,146,Marshall:,"You got beat by a girl.
"
4,24,147,Barney:,"So... You're in love with me?
"
4,24,148,Robin:,"What? Yes. Much.
"
4,24,149,Barney:,"You can stop. Lily told me everything.
"
4,24,150,Robin:,"Damn, Lily!
"
4,24,151,Barney:,"I can not believe it.
"
4,24,152,Robin:,"It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that.
"
4,24,153,Barney:,"Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same.
"
4,24,154,Robin:,"Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, ""stifles it in the bud"" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you.
"
4,24,155,Barney:,"It's going pretty fast, do not you think?
"
4,24,156,Robin:,"What?
"
4,24,157,Barney:,"We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends?
"
4,24,158,Robin:,"Friends.
"
4,24,159,Barney:,"My God. You just do it again. You've mosbys√©!
"
4,24,160,Robin:,"But no.
"
4,24,161,Barney:,"But if, little flirtatious.
"
4,24,162,Robin:,"You're right. I've just mosbyser.
"
4,24,163,Barney:,"Why are you scared to try?
"
4,24,164,Robin:,"Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.
"
4,24,165,Barney:,"Bad idea.
"
4,24,166,Robin:,"You're right. There must be a mistake.
"
4,24,167,Barney:,"No.
"
4,24,168,Robin:,"I love you.
"
4,24,169,Barney:,"Friends.
"
4,24,170,Robin:,"Friends, then.
"
4,24,171,Barney:,"I love you.
"
4,24,172,Robin:,"Let's get married.
"
4,24,173,Barney:,"No, you're smothering me.
"
4,24,174,Robin:,"OK, forget it.
"
4,24,175,Barney:,"You know what? We'll see later.
"
4,24,176,Robin:,"Yeah, let's go.
"
4,24,177,Ted (2030):,"It was a long and crazy night, but in the morning, against all odds, I made my presentation.
"
4,24,178,Ted:,"There he is, gentlemen. Rib Town. Is it not? Is it not?
"
4,24,179,Man:,"Ted, listen. You are great and you did a... great job, and you'll make other restaurants very happy one day, but... we...decided to go... in another direction.
"
4,24,180,Ted:,"What?
"
4,24,181,Man 2:,"Treat yourself with... Rib Town!
"
4,24,182,Ted:,"Sven...
"
4,24,183,Marshall:,"I'll tell you, I will eat more chops.
"
4,24,184,Barney:,"Yeah, right.
"
4,24,185,Marshall:,"I will not eat.. never... chops! Before Ted!
"
4,24,186,Ted:,"It's a disaster. How I will recover?
"
4,24,187,Lily:,"OK, I'm just asking. You really want to recover?
"
4,24,188,Ted:,"What does that mean?
"
4,24,189,Lily:,"Architecture is killing you and it kills us to see her kill you.You're like the goat with the mop. You want it so much, and whenever the world try to get the resume, it hooks you. But you know what? This is only a wimp. Why do you want?
"
4,24,190,Ted:,"Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan.
"
4,24,191,Lily:,"In the crapper, the plan. I wanted to be a famous artist.Marshall wanted to be environmental lawyer. Robin wanted to be a TV reporter.
"
4,24,192,Robin:,"I am a TV reporter. I am on the air at 4am.
"
4,24,193,Lily:,"It continues? Bravo.
"
4,24,194,Robin:,"What someone looks, please.
"
4,24,195,Lily:,"Barney wanted to be a violinist. Need not tell me. You can not draw your life as a building. It does not work like that. You must live it and draw it to itself.
"
4,24,196,Ted:,"So what, I should do anything?
"
4,24,197,Lily:,"Look what the world tells you to do and took the leap.
"
4,24,198,Marshall:,"You're right. You're completely right. I love you, Lily.
"
4,24,199,Lily:,"A metaphorical leap. A metaphorical leap!
"
4,24,200,All:,"Do not do that. Not cool.
"
4,24,201,Marshall:,"I did it!
"
4,24,202,Lily:,"Honey, you did it!
"
4,24,203,Marshall:,"I can do anything!
"
4,24,204,Lily:,"It's true!
"
4,24,205,Marshall:,"I bought a motorcycle!
"
4,24,206,Lily:,"No, not at all!
"
4,24,207,Marshall:,"OK, sorry. Come on, guys.
"
4,24,208,Ted (2030):,"This is the year that I was left at the altar. The year I was a bartender tared Knocked The year I got fired. The year I got beat by a goat. A girl goat, and more. Yet it was the best year of my life. Because if this had not happened, I never had the best job of my life. But most importantly, I would not have met your mother, because as you know... It was in this class.Of course, this story is just beginning.
"
4,18,1,Ted (2030):,"In spring 2009, I was hired to design a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank. And I hasten to add up to the plans of architect my paw.
"
4,18,2,Ted:,"Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it!
"
4,18,3,Ted (2030):,"There was a problem and his name was Bilson.
"
4,18,4,Bilson:,"Wood? Natural light? Oh, no! It reminds employees that there is an outside world where they have family and friends. We want to crush it! You arrive in the dark, you come home in the dark. You spend your whole damn day in the dark!
"
4,18,5,Marshall:,"I need to hear Lily.
"
4,18,6,Bilson:,"Who told you to leave?
"
4,18,7,Ted (2030):,"Bilson killed every one of my original ideas. Then one day the GNB has withdrawn from the project to create a new working group to oversee my plans. Everything changed at once.
"
4,18,8,Ted:,"On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home.
"
4,18,9,Ted (2030):,"Everything was fine until one day in the elevator.
"
4,18,10,Ted:,"Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?
"
4,18,11,Woman:,"Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try.
"
4,18,12,Barney:,"Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue.
"
4,18,13,Marshall:,"If I got a celebrity, it would be Lily. This is the star of my heart.
"
4,18,14,Lily:,"For me it would be Hugh Jackman.
"
4,18,15,Robin:,"You know, the celebrities, they like really weird s*x stuff. Believe me.
"
4,18,16,Barney:,"How do you know that?
"
4,18,17,Robin:,"It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity.
"
4,18,18,Lily:,"My God! Seriously?
"
4,18,19,Robin:,"He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story.
"
4,18,20,Lily:,"No, not the end of history. I need to know who, what, when and where. Balance!
"
4,18,21,Marshall:,"Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.
"
4,18,22,Barney:,"But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.
"
4,18,23,Robin:,"Not you, Barney.
"
4,18,24,Lily:,"Who's who?
"
4,18,25,Marshall:,"Now you've spun him hiccups.
"
4,18,26,Robin:,"I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection.
"
4,18,27,Marshall:,"What do you mean ""collection""?
"
4,18,28,Robin:,"As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.
"
4,18,29,Barney:,"Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.
"
4,18,30,Robin:,"I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much.
"
4,18,31,Lily:,"So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian s*x act.
"
4,18,32,Robin:,"Yes.
"
4,18,33,Lily:,"Tell us.
"
4,18,34,Robin:,"I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.
"
4,18,35,Marshall:,"It is simply impossible.
"
4,18,36,Robin:,"Right.
"
4,18,37,Lily:,"I do not even know of Canadian s*x act.
"
4,18,38,Barney:,"You have the Sled Dog, the Lobster Trap, the Mounted Police.
"
4,18,39,Lily:,"How do you know that?
"
4,18,40,Barney:,"Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite.
"
4,18,41,Marshall:,"Point org?
"
4,18,42,Barney:,"Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.
"
4,18,43,Ted:,"I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?
"
4,18,44,Barney:,"It is said? It should.
"
4,18,45,Marshall:,"No. I want to.
"
4,18,46,Barney:,"There's been no light.
"
4,18,47,Ted:,"What's going on?
"
4,18,48,Marshall:,"It's time you know. A few weeks ago, Bilson called us.
"
4,18,49,Bilson:,"We abandon the project for the new headquarters. This recession is killing us. It cancels all the superfluous. And I have difficult choices to make during my semi retirement in St. Croix.
"
4,18,50,Marshall:,"Dude, Ted will be devastated.
"
4,18,51,Bilson:,"Not if he learns his best friend.
"
4,18,52,Marshall and Barney:,"I have to say?
"
4,18,53,Marshall:,"Tell him, you're his best friend.
"
4,18,54,Barney:,"No, it's you.
"
4,18,55,Marshall:,"No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.
"
4,18,56,Barney:,"White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him.
"
4,18,57,Ted:,"How are you?
"
4,18,58,Marshall:,"You okay?
"
4,18,59,Ted:,"I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.
"
4,18,60,Barney:,"You should leave the project.
"
4,18,61,Marshall:,"It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.
"
4,18,62,Barney:,"It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...
"
4,18,63,Ted:,"Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.
"
4,18,64,Barney:,"It's funny you mention the project. Because...
"
4,18,65,Marshall:,"You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!
"
4,18,66,Ted:,"Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.
"
4,18,67,Barney:,"What was that?
"
4,18,68,Marshall:,"I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.
"
4,18,69,Barney:,"You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.
"
4,18,70,Marshall:,"But if I can.
"
4,18,71,Barney:,"Lie to me, there.
"
4,18,72,Marshall:,"I have a spaceship.
"
4,18,73,Barney:,"What kind of fuel?
"
4,18,74,Marshall:,"I have no spaceship.
"
4,18,75,Barney:,"But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.
"
4,18,76,Marshall:,"It is what color?
"
4,18,77,Barney:,"When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help.
"
4,18,78,Marshall:,"My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?
"
4,18,79,Ted:,"So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.
"
4,18,80,Marshall:,"We did it to protect you.
"
4,18,81,Ted:,"I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.
"
4,18,82,Lily:,"In Canada, it's called a snow plow Vicious.
"
4,18,83,Ted:,"This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.
"
4,18,84,Marshall:,"Sorry, Ted.
"
4,18,85,Ted:,"I need a drink.
"
4,18,86,Lily:,"The poor. It's moved if I return to Canada on s*x?
"
4,18,87,Marshall:,"Not at all.
"
4,18,88,Barney:,"You've been slow.
"
4,18,89,Lily:,"What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?
"
4,18,90,Robin:,"Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands.
"
4,18,91,Lily:,"Pack milk Manitoba?
"
4,18,92,Robin:,"It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi.
"
4,18,93,Lily:,"A Lobster Trap of Newfoundland?
"
4,18,94,Robin:,"I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy.
"
4,18,95,Lily:,"Well, I decided my first proposal.
"
4,18,96,Robin:,"Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection.
"
4,18,97,Lily:,"Well, I'm starting. Bryan Adams. He collects baseball cards and he wanted to make you... an oily Kayak.
"
4,18,98,Robin:,"No.
"
4,18,99,Barney:,"Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling.
"
4,18,100,Robin:,"No.
"
4,18,101,Marshall:,"Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake.
"
4,18,102,Robin:,"No. I would have accepted it.
"
4,18,103,Ted:,"Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?
"
4,18,104,Barney:,"Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson.
"
4,18,105,Marshall:,"So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team.
"
4,18,106,Marshall:,"You see Roy Waterman, Vice President of Venture Capital? It's actually... Roy maintenance. (In the hallway...) I'm sorry, Roy. How would you like to make you some money?
"
4,18,107,Roy:,"How far I have DESAPER?
"
4,18,108,Marshall:,"Louisa Mendoza, Vice President at Capital ex√©cutie, It's actually... Louisa from the cafeteria. (In the canteen...) Louisa, I need your help, but forbidden to speak.
"
4,18,109,Louisa:,"I speak English.
"
4,18,110,Marshall:,"Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say ""secret"" in Spanish?
"
4,18,111,Louisa:,"Pellets?
"
4,18,112,Marshall:,"Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street. (In the street...) Excuse me. One can argue?
"
4,18,113,Arty:,"Actually, my assistant, Reginald took my appointments.
"
4,18,114,Marshall:,"It was completed with the group of trainees and paid $ 50 for them to look enthusiastic when you talked...
"
4,18,115,Arty:,"Reginald, next week, get me out of here.
"
4,18,116,Ted:,"That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited.
"
4,18,117,Lily:,"Alex Trebek, a Guardian Event√©, teddy bear!
"
4,18,118,Robin:,"No.
"
4,18,119,Lily:,"Damn!
"
4,18,120,Ted:,"Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.
"
4,18,121,Marshall:,"Good job.
"
4,18,122,Barney:,"All right!
"
4,18,123,Ted:,"Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!
"
4,18,124,Louisa:,"No, I can not. I am engaged to Mr. Barney. We do not care. We live once!
"
4,18,125,Ted:,"No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!
"
4,18,126,Ted:,"Is there anything else you want to tell me?
"
4,18,127,Marshall:,"When you played third base for the softball team GNB.
"
4,18,128,Barney:,"There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.
"
4,18,129,Ted:,"My lap of honor was bogus?
"
4,18,130,Marshall:,"Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that.
"
4,18,131,Ted:,"Lying?
"
4,18,132,Marshall:,"Sometimes, yes, to protect them.
"
4,18,133,Ted:,"False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.
"
4,18,134,Barney:,"Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?
"
4,18,135,Marshall:,"You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. ""Trout. ""Right? ""Sturgeon. ""I think so buddy.""Salmon. ""I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? ""Bar. ""This guy is what I mean. ""Halibut. ""Thank you, good evening. How do I?
"
4,18,136,Ted:,"Super. Very funny.
"
4,18,137,Barney:,"Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone.
"
4,18,138,Marshall:,"Timeout. You do not like fish?
"
4,18,139,Ted:,"It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.
"
4,18,140,Marshall:,"Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me.
"
4,18,141,Ted:,"It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone.
"
4,18,142,Robin:,"For me, it's called a...
"
4,18,143,Lily:,"A Totem of Saskatoon. It's here.
"
4,18,144,Ted:,"Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?
"
4,18,145,Barney:,"Nice shirt.
"
4,18,146,Ted:,"You're the devil.
"
4,18,147,Marshall:,"What if we told you that you found another project to GNB, where you have to redo part of the 20th floor.
"
4,18,148,Ted:,"If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?
"
4,18,149,Barney:,"This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us.
"
4,18,150,Ted:,"Wait, what is a P.T.E.?
"
4,18,151,Barney:,"Room for Transitional Employees.
"
4,18,152,Ted:,"What does that mean?
"
4,18,153,Barney:,"It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.
"
4,18,154,Marshall:,"It turns people here.
"
4,18,155,Ted:,"It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?
"
4,18,156,Marshall:,"GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.
"
4,18,157,Barney:,"It's serious there.
"
4,18,158,Ted (2030):,"Reluctantly, I agreed to design a room where people turn. But I was determined to put my key.
"
4,18,159,Ted:,"Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call ""the Renaissance Corridor Quiet."" Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life.
"
4,18,160,Bilson:,"I love.
"
4,18,161,Barney:,"Really?
"
4,18,162,Bilson:,"Good job, Ted.
"
4,18,163,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
4,18,164,Bilson:,"You can add these keys to the PTE the 18th floor?
"
4,18,165,Ted:,"Absolutely.
"
4,18,166,Bilson:,"Awesome. 'll See about that.
"
4,18,167,Ted:,"OK, I think this wall...
"
4,18,168,Bilson:,"You're fired!
"
4,18,169,Ted:,"What?
"
4,18,170,Bilson:,"I wanted this piece! This same room, two floors up!
"
4,18,171,Ted:,"But...
"
4,18,172,Bilson:,"You're fired! Away from here. (His phone rings and Ted lot) Hi, honey.
"
4,18,173,Lily:,"Anyone of Rush, a Meat Pie from Montreal and a lunchbox superhero.
"
4,18,174,Robin:,"No.
"
4,18,175,Lily:,"Rick Moranis, the Reverse Rich Moranis, of Jewish antiquities. I give up. It's been three days that I seek. I stop. If that means I could ever be.
"
4,18,176,Robin:,"Well.
"
4,18,177,Lily:,"Tell us about it!
"
4,18,178,Robin:,"You really want to know?
"
4,18,179,"Marshall, Lily and Barney:","Yes!
"
4,18,180,Robin:,"But this info does not leave the table.
"
4,18,181,Lily:,"My God. I am so excited. (Robin passes him a paper) I will read.
"
4,18,182,Barney:,"Read it.
"
4,18,183,Marshall:,"Read it.
"
4,18,184,Lily:,"I will read it. Let's go. ""The Frozen Snowshoe,"" ""Old King Clancy"", ""The Plateaux of Harvey.""
"
4,18,185,Robin:,"So?
"
4,18,186,Lily:,"I do not understand any of these words.
"
4,18,187,Barney:,"One of them is supposed to be famous?
"
4,18,188,Marshall:,"Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is?
"
4,18,189,Robin:,"This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup.
"
4,18,190,Marshall:,"And fame, this is Harvey L√©plateaux?
"
4,18,191,Robin:,"No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!
"
4,18,192,Lily:,"So fame was...
"
4,18,193,Robin:,"The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick ""The Daredevil"" at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic.
"
4,18,194,Lily:,"So you say you Racket Jelly invited him home to show you trays of Harvey, and you've asked him to do an Old King Clancy?
"
4,18,195,Robin:,"Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone.
"
4,18,196,Lily:,"My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.
"
4,18,197,Barney:,"You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?
"
4,18,198,Marshall:,"Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE?
"
4,18,199,Ted:,"I'm more about the project.
"
4,18,200,Marshall:,"What?
"
4,18,201,Ted:,"Bilson fired me.
"
4,18,202,Marshall:,"You're kidding.
"
4,18,203,Lily:,"What does that mean for your company? You're going to be fired?
"
4,18,204,Ted:,"Actually, I just resign.
"
4,18,205,Marshall:,"Why?
"
4,18,206,Ted:,"I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your ""working group"", I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.
"
4,18,207,Barney:,"They've turned, eh?
"
4,18,208,Ted:,"Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box.
"
4,18,209,Lily:,"It's exciting.
"
4,18,210,Barney:,"With this economy?
"
4,18,211,Marshall:,"So, do we want it?
"
4,18,212,Ted:,"Ultimately, I am grateful.
"
4,18,213,Barney:,"What was it with Bilson?
"
4,18,214,Ted:,"After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.
"
4,18,215,Barney:,"You've hit with a chair?
"
4,18,216,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
4,18,217,Barney:,"Well done.
"
4,18,218,Man:,"That one, I got to the restaurant between Milverton and Wawa.
"
4,18,219,Robin:,"It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.
"
4,18,220,Man:,"We're friends. Call me ""racket"". Sit down.
"
4,18,221,Robin:,"So... Snowshoeing Would you like me... Old King Clancy one?
"
4,18,222,Snowshoeing:,"You should go.
"
4,15,1,Lily:,"Look. Three beautiful blondes drinking bad decision juice at 8am.
"
4,15,2,Marshall:,"Pretty radar chest. This is my wife.
"
4,15,3,Barney:,"No, I must go.
"
4,15,4,Lily:,"Seriously? They are blond and stuffed. This is not your type?
"
4,15,5,Barney:,"Maybe I did not like. My God, you think that the male spirit is really so simple, we all have a favorite type? Lord.Asian, big tits. I go to the bathroom, then I'm going.
"
4,15,6,Lily:,"You noticed that Barney is weird lately?
"
4,15,7,Ted:,"Actually, yes. You know, he never gives flowers to a girl, because living things remind babies?
"
4,15,8,Lily:,"Yes.
"
4,15,9,Ted:,"The other day I saw him in a flower shop on the 82nd, he bought roses.
"
4,15,10,Robin:,"What?
"
4,15,11,Marshall:,"Now that you say, Barney did something weird yesterday at the office.
"
4,15,12,Barney:,"OK, to Saturday. (Marshall is in the doorway) I was thinking of a brunch, and perhaps a hike. I love you too.
"
4,15,13,Marshall:,"I thought he was talking to a girl he just wanted to jump. Or Ted, but now I know more.
"
4,15,14,Lily:,"You think it is possible that Barney Stinson has a girlfriend?
"
4,15,15,Barney:,"A plus.
"
4,15,16,Lily:,"Wait. Where are you going?
"
4,15,17,Barney:,"Nowhere. At the beach. It's winter. Laser Tag. At home. Shut up! It is you who are going somewhere.
"
4,15,18,Lily:,"My God. He goes to see now.
"
4,15,19,Marshall:,"Where is Barney?
"
4,15,20,Ted:,"Yeah. It is even more in Manhattan. Where does this girl?
"
4,15,21,Robin:,"We talk about a woman that Barney Stinson has worked. I vote for Narnia.
"
4,15,22,Ted:,"He stops.
"
4,15,23,Barney:,"What are you doing here?
"
4,15,24,Lily:,"Where is she?
"
4,15,25,Barney:,"Who?
"
4,15,26,Lily:,"Your girlfriend. You did not really like, huh?
"
4,15,27,Barney:,"These are my friends. Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin.Guys, here is Loretta. My mother.
"
4,15,28,Loretta:,"Nice to meet you. I feel I already know you. Barney can not stop talking about you every day.
"
4,15,29,Robin:,"You call your mother every day?
"
4,15,30,Barney:,"Mom!
"
4,15,31,Lily:,"So that's what we hide you? You did not want people to know that you're a momma's boy.
"
4,15,32,Barney:,"Yes, you got me. I guess you can leave.
"
4,15,33,Woman:,"Hello.
"
4,15,34,Robin:,"Hi.
"
4,15,35,Woman:,"Who are these people?
"
4,15,36,Barney:,"Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin. I present to you Betty... my wife. And my son, Tyler.
"
4,15,37,Loretta:,"Betty and I are going to prepare dinner. There will be something for everyone.
"
4,15,38,Betty:,"But forget, one meatloaf, after what was said Dr. Grossbard on your cholesterol.
"
4,15,39,Barney:,"She wants me to live long.
"
4,15,40,Betty:,"Guilty. I love you.
"
4,15,41,Barney:,"Me too.
"
4,15,42,Tyler:,"Me-seven!
"
4,15,43,Barney:,"Will in, little rascal! I'll see you at the bar?
"
4,15,44,Robin:,"What's that, Barney?
"
4,15,45,Barney:,"It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price.
"
4,15,46,Robin:,"Very good program.
"
4,15,47,Marshall:,"Bob Barker is your father.
"
4,15,48,Barney:,"She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill.
"
4,15,49,Barney:,"I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged.
"
4,15,50,Barney:,"I hired an actress to play my girlfriend ""Betty"". His real name is Margaret. It is mainly small theaters. Superb actress.In it a Moliere. I say no more. This is political. I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise.
"
4,15,51,Barney:,"You see, Mom? I found someone who makes me happy. As you wished.
"
4,15,52,Loretta:,"It's beautiful. I wish I could stay for small children.
"
4,15,53,Betty:,"I'm pregnant!
"
4,15,54,Barney:,"And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep ""Betty"" and make a casting to find my son, Tyler.
"
4,15,55,Lily:,"It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?
"
4,15,56,Barney:,"For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition.
"
4,15,57,Barney:,"four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave.
"
4,15,58,Woman:,"You said if I slept with you, my son would have the role.
"
4,15,59,Barney:,"Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11!
"
4,15,60,Barney:,"And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant.
"
4,15,61,Ted:,"Come on, Grant looks pretty good.
"
4,15,62,Barney:,"Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?
"
4,15,63,Grant:,"Yes?
"
4,15,64,Barney:,"You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s.
"
4,15,65,Lily:,"It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left.
"
4,15,66,Marshall:,"It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.
"
4,15,67,Barney:,"Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat.
"
4,15,68,Lily:,"Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde?
"
4,15,69,Barney:,"No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily.
"
4,15,70,Ted:,"I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!
"
4,15,71,Betty:,"Really?
"
4,15,72,Ted:,"Yes.
"
4,15,73,Betty:,"Thank you. I know not, finally, the purpose of Brecht's work is of course...
"
4,15,74,Ted and Betty:,".. to confuse people.
"
4,15,75,Ted:,"Yes. Sorry. You got a Brechtophile before thee!
"
4,15,76,Betty:,"You know it really theater.
"
4,15,77,Ted:,"Mrs Theatre has won my heart once and has never left me. Every year at Christmas, I created a piece for parents with all the kids.
"
4,15,78,Boy:,"Hey, Santa, do you think we can take off with this weather?
"
4,15,79,Ted:,"Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.
"
4,15,80,Ted:,"I always wanted to be an actor. It is this kind of dream that flies away with time.
"
4,15,81,Betty:,"Look, if you want, I can give you advice as an actor.
"
4,15,82,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,15,83,Betty:,"I would love. Rule number one player...
"
4,15,84,Grant:,"At least one person who still loves to play. I miss that.
"
4,15,85,Robin:,"You do not like playing the son of Barney?
"
4,15,86,Grant:,"I hate. But what can I do? I get no phone call.
"
4,15,87,Robin:,"I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years.
"
4,15,88,Grant:,"Come on, you're still beautiful. I love your new nose.
"
4,15,89,Robin:,"I have not had surgery.
"
4,15,90,Grant:,"That's it. Neither do I.
"
4,15,91,Lily:,"I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great?
"
4,15,92,Loretta:,"Thank you, darling. Actually, I was not so perfect a mother when I was younger.
"
4,15,93,Marshall:,"Do not say that. I'm sure you were great.
"
4,15,94,Loretta:,"Yeah, I was rather a drag.
"
4,15,95,Lily:,"I'm sorry?
"
4,15,96,Loretta:,"A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, ""I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet. "" Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive.
"
4,15,97,Marshall:,"Barney Mom? Loretta.
"
4,15,98,Loretta:,"Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect.
"
4,15,99,Marshall:,"You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.
"
4,15,100,Barney:,"No, no question. The truth would kill her.
"
4,15,101,Marshall:,"I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?
"
4,15,102,Lily:,"Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, ""Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. ""
"
4,15,103,Marshall:,"She was joking.
"
4,15,104,Lily:,"She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget.
"
4,15,105,Marshall:,"You're going to say what?
"
4,15,106,Lily:,"Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?
"
4,15,107,Barney:,"On the bed ""race car""?
"
4,15,108,Marshall:,"The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it.
"
4,15,109,Lily:,"Really? I hate your mother.
"
4,15,110,Marshall:,"You know what? I hate you!
"
4,15,111,Loretta:,"In two minutes, meat loaf!
"
4,15,112,Tyler:,"Meatloaf? Tyler to love!
"
4,15,113,Barney:,"We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!
"
4,15,114,Grant:,"But it's funny.
"
4,15,115,Barney:,"I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.
"
4,15,116,Robin:,"Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?
"
4,15,117,Barney:,"Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.
"
4,15,118,Robin:,"What kind?
"
4,15,119,Betty:,"And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears.
"
4,15,120,Barney:,"The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!
"
4,15,121,Betty:,"You better stop!
"
4,15,122,Barney:,"Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship.
"
4,15,123,Betty:,"So I go out raging in the garden, and... candles everywhere... and a string quartet. You come to believe?
"
4,15,124,Lily:,"No, not at all.
"
4,15,125,Loretta:,"And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?
"
4,15,126,Barney:,"Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?
"
4,15,127,Tyler:,"Well...
"
4,15,128,Barney:,"Page 4...
"
4,15,129,Tyler:,"The dinosaur bones at the museum have come back to life and chasing me?
"
4,15,130,Marshall:,"Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.
"
4,15,131,Barney:,"Tyler said: ""In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that. ""
"
4,15,132,Loretta:,"It was cute.
"
4,15,133,Barney:,"We're a happy family.
"
4,15,134,Loretta:,"I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen.
"
4,15,135,Barney:,"No weak link in this scene. Bravo!
"
4,15,136,Robin:,"Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs.
"
4,15,137,Marshall:,"You can stop with that?
"
4,15,138,Barney:,"Go and eat your ice.
"
4,15,139,Grant:,"I can not. I'm lactose intolerant.
"
4,15,140,Barney:,"Guess who is not lactose intolerant: Tyler. Tyler will go there and enjoy every bite.
"
4,15,141,Loretta:,"It's time for ice!
"
4,15,142,Barney:,"Yum!
"
4,15,143,Loretta:,"My God!
"
4,15,144,Tyler:,"Tyler dislike.
"
4,15,145,Barney:,"You're not gonna get us out a slogan.
"
4,15,146,Loretta:,"I do not understand.
"
4,15,147,Barney:,"I, yes. Follow me. I... been betrayed by my best friend.How could you do that, Ted? Think of the poor Tyler who tries valiantly to hold back tears. It's good my boy, you can cry.Weep!
"
4,15,148,Tyler:,"I do not want my mom and dad divorced!
"
4,15,149,Barney:,"What can you have to say for yourself?
"
4,15,150,Betty:,"Rule number one player: ""Do not be afraid to improvise.""
"
4,15,151,Ted:,"Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?
"
4,15,152,Barney:,"Sorry. What?
"
4,15,153,Betty:,"Rule number 5 player: ""Invent a rich backdrop for your character. ""
"
4,15,154,Ted:,"November 14, 1998. The night train to Monte Carlo. I was in the car pool arnaquant Algerians few thousand dinars, while thou s√©duisais my bride! Who is blind and took you for me.
"
4,15,155,Barney:,"For God's sake, what are you talking?
"
4,15,156,Betty:,"Rule number 8 player: ""Do not be afraid to come to blows. ""
"
4,15,157,Ted:,"You know not well what I mean?
"
4,15,158,Barney:,"No, not at all.
"
4,15,159,Ted:,"Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!
"
4,15,160,Barney:,"Mom, you leave us a moment?
"
4,15,161,Loretta:,"There was chocolate and caramel. There are lots of kinds of noodles and marshmallows.
"
4,15,162,Barney:,"You've lost your mind?
"
4,15,163,Betty:,"You were amazing! You really become that character.
"
4,15,164,Ted:,"Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.
"
4,15,165,Barney:,"What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?
"
4,15,166,Lily:,"It may be time to tell him the truth.
"
4,15,167,Marshall:,"I know. Sometimes, honesty leads people to say bad things about the woman who always took care of me because I was the runt of the family. For God's sake, I'm just a 92 m!
"
4,15,168,Grant:,"How were my tears?
"
4,15,169,Robin:,"Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do.
"
4,15,170,Grant:,"It may be like that in your new job.
"
4,15,171,Robin:,"You think so?
"
4,15,172,Grant:,"I know.
"
4,15,173,Robin:,"Thank you, Grant. You're pretty smart, you know that?
"
4,15,174,Grant:,"We are sorry! I thought something was happening.
"
4,15,175,Loretta:,"Honey, you okay?
"
4,15,176,Barney:,"Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over.
"
4,15,177,Loretta:,"My God!
"
4,15,178,Barney:,"None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family.
"
4,15,179,Loretta:,"What?
"
4,15,180,Barney:,"I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom.
"
4,15,181,Loretta:,"Well, Betty is not your wife?
"
4,15,182,Barney:,"No.
"
4,15,183,Loretta:,"thank you God! I do not like this woman.
"
4,15,184,Barney:,"Really?
"
4,15,185,Loretta:,"Yes. And Tyler... I know I am his grandmother and I'm supposed to love him, but I hate him. ""Tyler not love! ""What does that mean?
"
4,15,186,Barney:,"Is it not?
"
4,15,187,Loretta:,"With your fake friends over there, I wanted to shoot myself.
"
4,15,188,Barney:,"I know! They are not horrible? So really, you angry with me?
"
4,15,189,Loretta:,"I'm confused. I do not know why you thought having to do that. I love you, perfect family or not. I love you, no matter what.
"
4,15,190,Barney:,"Really?
"
4,15,191,Loretta:,"Really.
"
4,15,192,Barney:,"I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you.
"
4,15,193,Loretta:,"Whatever. I love you always.
"
4,15,194,Barney:,"Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do.
"
4,15,195,Loretta:,"When you were 3 years old, I left you with a babysitter and spent three weeks with Grand Funk Railroad, from one guy to another like a bang.
"
4,15,196,Barney:,"Mom!
"
4,15,197,Loretta:,"Promise me one thing. If ever you meet someone special, do not run away. Do not like me. Take a chance, okay?
"
4,15,198,Robin:,"The taxi is here.
"
4,15,199,Barney:,"I'll try.
"
4,15,200,Ted (2030):,"Thus ended one of the strangest afternoons of our lives.
"
4,15,201,Lily:,"And I just wanted to say, if I was never cold or distant, I'm sorry.
"
4,15,202,Robin:,"Who speaks it?
"
4,15,203,Marshall:,"My mother.
"
4,15,204,Lily:,"It mean a lot to me if we could be closer.
"
4,15,205,Betty:,"Breathe loudly as if the result would be hard to say. I love you.
"
4,15,206,Lily:,"I love you...
"
4,15,207,Ted:,"Mom...
"
4,15,208,Lily:,".. Mom.
"
4,15,209,Betty:,"Do like I was nice.
"
4,15,210,Lily:,"Do like I was nice. I mean, it's really nice of you, Judy.You too. See you soon.
"
4,15,211,Marshall:,"That I understand that. You tell me when you watch Karate Kid, you're not in San Daniel?
"
4,15,212,Barney:,"Nope!
"
4,15,213,Ted:,"Who do you like in Die Hard?
"
4,15,214,Barney:,"Hans Gruber, the villain class. At the end, it is trapped.This is the title character.
"
4,15,215,Lily:,"OK, and Breakfast Club?
"
4,15,216,Barney:,"The teacher who is watching. This is the only one who passes the whole movie in a suit.
"
4,15,217,Robin:,"I have one. Terminator.
"
4,15,218,Barney:,"What is the title, Robin? Who among us has not shed a tear when his small red eye goes to the end and he can not kill these people? Sorry. The film...
"
4,15,219,Ted:,"I'll watch the film again with you.
"
4,15,220,Barney:,"They even try to help!
"
4,1,1,Ted(2030):,"Kids, there is something I wish my dad told me. The longest pause you will ever experience in your life is the one that follows asking the question...
"
4,1,2,Ted:,"Will you marry me?
"
4,1,3,Ted(2030):,"Your brain goes into overdrive, imaging every possible response.
"
4,1,4,Stella:,"No.
"
4,1,5,Stella:,"Oh, God, no.
"
4,1,6,Stella:,"You want me to marry..(laughing).No.
"
4,1,7,Stella:,"Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't. Mark Johnson, the quarterback from your high school football team, already asked me.
"
4,1,8,Mark Johnson:,"What's up, Turd?
"
4,1,9,Ted:,"It's Ted!
"
4,1,10,Ted (2030):,"But if you're lucky, she may answer with the single greatest word in the English language.
"
4,1,11,Stella:,"Yes.
"
4,1,12,Ted (2030):,"Stella and I spent that summer happily engaged. Marshall was still coping with unemployment.
"
4,1,13,Marshall to lily:,"What are you doing?
"
4,1,14,Ted(2030):,"Lily threw herself into her painting.
"
4,1,15,Marshall to Barney:,"What are you doing?
"
4,1,16,Ted(2030):,"Barney was rehabilitating from his bus accident.
"
4,1,17,Marshall to himself:,"What are you doing?
"
4,1,18,Ted(2030):,"And well, Marshall just kept coping with unemployment.
"
4,1,19,Marshall to Robin:,"What are you doing?
"
4,1,20,Ted(2030):,"And Robin continued to uphold the high journalistic standards of Metro News 1.
"
4,1,21,Robin:,"Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family? Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking... Tooth.
"
4,1,22,Robin:,"Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter.
"
4,1,23,Barney:,"""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke.
"
4,1,24,Lily:,"Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny.
"
4,1,25,Barney:,"Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" Classic.
"
4,1,26,Lily:,"Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?
"
4,1,27,Barney:,"I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?
"
4,1,28,Lily:,"Barney, just say it.
"
4,1,29,Barney:,"I think I'm in love with Robin.
"
4,1,30,Marshall:,"Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas for Stella's wedding shower. Does she like to cook?
"
4,1,31,Ted:,"Actually, I don't know.
"
4,1,32,Marshall:,"What's her favorite color?
"
4,1,33,Ted:,"Don't know that either.
"
4,1,34,Marshall:,"Well, does she have any hobbies?
"
4,1,35,Ted:,"Yes. She's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies. And interests, too. I am one lucky son of a bitch.
"
4,1,36,Marshall:,"Dude, you don't know anything about the woman you're marrying.
"
4,1,37,Ted:,"What? You're crazy! I know plenty.
"
4,1,38,Marshall:,"What color are her eyes?
"
4,1,39,Ted:,"The color of the ocean after a storm.
"
4,1,40,Marshall:,"Which is?
"
4,1,41,Ted:,"Beautiful.
"
4,1,42,Lily:,"I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your s*x swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet!
"
4,1,43,Barney:,"It's not ""sweet."" It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything.
"
4,1,44,Lily:,"Barney, you don't ""catch"" feelings, you just have them. And they're good.
"
4,1,45,Barney:,"They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin.
"
4,1,46,Girl:,"Morning.
"
4,1,47,Barney:,"I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin.
"
4,1,48,Ted:,"Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something?
"
4,1,49,Marshall:,"No, Ted, I like Stella a lot. She's a Mets fan.
"
4,1,50,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,1,51,Marshall:,"It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?
"
4,1,52,Ted:,"I'll have a whole life time to get to know her better. Right now, I know the one thing that I have to: that I love her.
"
4,1,53,Lily:,"You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?
"
4,1,54,Barney:,"I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, ""How can an ant carry ""20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?"" Are the two even related? Really?
"
4,1,55,Lily:,"Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.
"
4,1,56,Barney:,"""Boyfriend""? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend.
"
4,1,57,Lily:,"Well, what do you want, then?
"
4,1,58,Barney:,"I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.
"
4,1,59,Lily:,"Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that.
"
4,1,60,Barney:,"Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?
"
4,1,61,Lily:,"I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little b*st*rd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?
"
4,1,62,Barney:,"Deal.
"
4,1,63,Robin:,"Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?
"
4,1,64,Stella:,"I know dudes think it's girlie for a guy to cook, but us ladies? We find it mighty sexy.
"
4,1,65,Ted:,"Really? You know... My grandma taught me how.
"
4,1,66,Stella:,"Oh, yeah, she did.
"
4,1,67,Ted:,"Yeah. I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because I wasn't good at sports.
"
4,1,68,Stella:,"I'm on fire right now. Delicious. What's in this pesto?
"
4,1,69,Ted:,"Oh, you know, the usual: basil, garlic, olive oil, but can you guess my secret ingredient?
"
4,1,70,Stella:,"Peanuts.
"
4,1,71,Ted:,"Yes. How did you know that?
"
4,1,72,Ted:,"OK, let me think, what else?
"
4,1,73,Stella:,"You know what, sweetie? I woke up so early and I had a really long day at work. And there was that whole thing where you tried to kill me. Can we please just go to sleep?
"
4,1,74,Ted:,"No, I clearly need to know more about you. Let's do firsts. First kiss?
"
4,1,75,Stella:,"Dale Harris, second grade. You're talking like peck on the cheek or a full-on passionate making out?
"
4,1,76,Stella:,"OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.
"
4,1,77,Ted:,"First time you had s*x.
"
4,1,78,Stella:,"Dale Harris, second...
"
4,1,79,Ted:,"Stop it.
"
4,1,80,Stella:,"Billy Devito, sophomore year of college.
"
4,1,81,Ted:,"Prude. Molly McKenzie, junior year of high school.
"
4,1,82,Stella:,"Slut.
"
4,1,83,Lily:,"Robin just needs to see this new see of you.
"
4,1,84,Barney:,"So just call her up?
"
4,1,85,Lily:,"Just call her up.
"
4,1,86,Barney (on the phone):,"Hi, Robin..(he jabbers something and hang up) She wasn't there. I left a voice mail.
"
4,1,87,Lily:,"You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times.
"
4,1,88,Barney:,"Yeah, but those were just booty calls.
"
4,1,89,Barney (present):,"On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say...
"
4,1,90,Barney:,"Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait.
"
4,1,91,Barney (present):,"But the later it gets, the fewer words you need.
"
4,1,92,Barney (present):,"And by 3:00 in the morning...
"
4,1,93,Barney:,"Sweet.
"
4,1,94,Lily:,"A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?
"
4,1,95,Barney:,"It's no worse than your super-obvious code words.
"
4,1,96,Lily:,"Rhinoceros.
"
4,1,97,Marshall:,"We have to go.
"
4,1,98,Lily:,"Great. Now we need a new code word.
"
4,1,99,Barney:,"Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure?
"
4,1,100,Robin:,"You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?
"
4,1,101,Barney (to lily):,"Help me!
"
4,1,102,Lily:,"Just ask her something.
"
4,1,103,Barney:,"How are you feeling today?
"
4,1,104,Robin:,"Fine.
"
4,1,105,Lily:,"Something personal.
"
4,1,106,Barney:,"At what age did you first get your period?
"
4,1,107,Robin:,"Did you just ask me about about my period?
"
4,1,108,Barney:,"No, I did not.
"
4,1,109,Robin:,"Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.
"
4,1,110,Lily:,"Just ask her out.
"
4,1,111,Barney:,"Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again.
"
4,1,112,Lily:,"Gross.
"
4,1,113,Ted:,"First movie you ever saw.
"
4,1,114,Stella:,"Benji,1981. I watched it recently with Lucy and I just thought, ""Oh, that dog is so dead right now."" What about you?
"
4,1,115,Ted:,"My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.
"
4,1,116,Stella:,"You know, I've actually never seen Star Wars.
"
4,1,117,Marshall:,"She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.
"
4,1,118,Ted:,"You've got to calm down.
"
4,1,119,Marshall:,"I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?
"
4,1,120,Ted:,"Dude, it's just a movie.
"
4,1,121,Marshall:,"Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.
"
4,1,122,Ted:,"It's just a movie. It's just a movie!
"
4,1,123,Ted:,"If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.
"
4,1,124,Marshall:,"You can't.
"
4,1,125,Ted:,"You want to watch it again?
"
4,1,126,Marshall:,"I do.
"
4,1,127,Barney:,"Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing.
"
4,1,128,Lily:,"I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.
"
4,1,129,Barney:,"Why?
"
4,1,130,Lily:,"Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.
"
4,1,131,Barney:,"Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot.
"
4,1,132,Lily:,"We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.
"
4,1,133,Barney:,"You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?
"
4,1,134,Lily:,"Ted hit that for over a year.
"
4,1,135,Barney:,"Wish me luck.
"
4,1,136,Ted:,"I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.
"
4,1,137,Stella:,"Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?
"
4,1,138,Ted:,"The movie's already started, so...
"
4,1,139,Stella:,"It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway.
"
4,1,140,Ted:,"Oh, my God. Marshall appears behind the couch.
"
4,1,141,Marshall:,"Off to a bad start.
"
4,1,142,Ted:,"What are you doing down there?
"
4,1,143,Marshall:,"I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing.
"
4,1,144,Ted:,"What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job.
"
4,1,145,Marshall:,"I really do, don't I?
"
4,1,146,Barney:,"So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened.
"
4,1,147,Robin:,"What?
"
4,1,148,Barney:,"I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen.
"
4,1,149,Robin:,"Why are you acting like this?
"
4,1,150,Barney:,"Like what?
"
4,1,151,Robin:,"You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.
"
4,1,152,Barney:,"I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful.
"
4,1,153,Robin:,"Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.
"
4,1,154,Barney:,"Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.
"
4,1,155,Robin:,"That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.
"
4,1,156,Barney:,"Your teeth look fantastic.
"
4,1,157,Robin:,"Who are you?
"
4,1,158,Stella:,"What?
"
4,1,159,Ted:,"Nothing.
"
4,1,160,Stella:,"You were staring at me.
"
4,1,161,Ted:,"You look really beautiful tonight.
"
4,1,162,Stella:,"You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck
"
4,1,163,Ted:,"Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.
"
4,1,164,Stella:,"Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?
"
4,1,165,Ted:,"Nothing.
"
4,1,166,Stella:,"Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go.
"
4,1,167,Marshall:,"Should I leave, too?
"
4,1,168,Ted:,"What part, what part?
"
4,1,169,Barney:,"Thanks.
"
4,1,170,Robin:,"Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?
"
4,1,171,Barney:,"I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.
"
4,1,172,Robin:,"There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.
"
4,1,173,Barney:,"Why not?
"
4,1,174,Robin:,"Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.
"
4,1,175,Barney:,"We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.
"
4,1,176,Robin:,"It's not as easy...
"
4,1,177,Barney:,"Promise me you'll apply.
"
4,1,178,Robin:,"I promise.
"
4,1,179,Marshall:,"She's up to the scene where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's trash compactor.
"
4,1,180,Ted:,"Great scene.
"
4,1,181,Marshall:,"Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep.
"
4,1,182,Ted:,"I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.
"
4,1,183,Marshall:,"I'll tell her you still want to be friends.
"
4,1,184,Ted:,"I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone) ""Stop watching me, jackasses.""
"
4,1,185,Barney:,"To taking chances.
"
4,1,186,Robin:,"To taking chances.
"
4,1,187,Barney:,"You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about.
"
4,1,188,Barman:,"Last call.
"
4,1,189,Barney:,"Of course it is. One more for the road?
"
4,1,190,Robin:,"Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?
"
4,1,191,Stella:,"I loved it.
"
4,1,192,Ted:,"Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.
"
4,1,193,Stella:,"What was that?
"
4,1,194,Ted:,"I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you m*st*rb*t*ng little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room.
"
4,1,195,Stella:,"It was so good.
"
4,1,196,Marshall:,"You hated it, didn't you?
"
4,1,197,Stella:,"It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?
"
4,1,198,Marshall:,"Wookiee.
"
4,1,199,Stella:,"He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, ""That's a good point, Bear, ""let's try that.""
"
4,1,200,Marshall:,"He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?
"
4,1,201,Stella:,"I do.
"
4,1,202,Marshall:,"Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.
"
4,1,203,Barney:,"So, here's the deal.
"
4,1,204,Robin:,"April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.
"
4,1,205,Barney:,"Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?
"
4,1,206,Robin:,"You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.
"
4,1,207,April:,"So are you... nervous about the game?
"
4,1,208,Barney:,"Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.
"
4,1,209,Barney:,"And that was it.
"
4,1,210,Lily:,"I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...
"
4,1,211,April:,"When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?
"
4,1,212,Barney:,"My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true.
"
4,1,213,Lily:,"Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now.
"
4,1,214,Barney:,"I choose bimbos.
"
4,1,215,Lily:,"What?
"
4,1,216,Barney:,"Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.
"
4,1,217,Lily:,"This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.
"
4,1,218,Barney:,"Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?
"
4,1,219,Lily:,"See you, Barney.
"
4,14,1,Marshall:,"It's crazy that Metro News One sends you this letter now.
"
4,14,2,Robin:,"Yes, I went for 4 months.
"
4,14,3,Lily:,"You got more fans than I thought.
"
4,14,4,Ted:,"And only 60% of them are prisoners.
"
4,14,5,Robin:,"These guys think what? I am far from my phase ""dating a prisoner."" It's like: ""Hi, I am over 19 years.""
"
4,14,6,Barney:,"The daughter of the lottery is there.
"
4,14,7,Robin:,"I'm sorry for these women. This is where careers go to die on TV.
"
4,14,8,Barney:,"Look. It's funny. I invented a little game
"
4,14,9,Presenter:,"The lotto numbers tonight are... 19...
"
4,14,10,Barney:,"Your age on arrival in New York after a photographer you have ""discovered"" to be published in Vogue.
"
4,14,11,Presenter:,"53...
"
4,14,12,Barney:,"The number of nude photos that he has done before you realize he had no connection to Vogue.
"
4,14,13,Presenter:,"22...
"
4,14,14,Barney:,"The age that you say you have.
"
4,14,15,Presenter:,"31...
"
4,14,16,Barney:,"Your real age.
"
4,14,17,Presenter:,"45...
"
4,14,18,Barney:,"The number of minutes for me to put in a taxi, get undressed and into my Jacuzzi.
"
4,14,19,Presenter:,"And the super bowl tonight is...
"
4,14,20,Barney:,"What happens after that is out of the jacuzzi. Great?
"
4,14,21,Ted (2030):,"Children in the winter of 2009, Robin was unemployed for months. But there was a glimmer of hope.
"
4,14,22,Robin:,"Hi.
"
4,14,23,Lily:,"How was the audition?
"
4,14,24,Robin:,"I went very confident. I knew it was just me against two other girls.
"
4,14,25,Barney:,"I listening.
"
4,14,26,Robin:,"Hello.
"
4,14,27,Woman 1:,"Hello.
"
4,14,28,Robin:,"Robin Scherbatsky. And you are?
"
4,14,29,Woman 1:,"You have obviously never been to Denver.Rochelle Harper, News Center 12. It was just the first string for the Rockies... 5 years on.
"
4,14,30,Robin:,"I was a presenter here for Metro News One.
"
4,14,31,Rochelle:,"Presenter. You must have a mirror finish.
"
4,14,32,Robin:,"Sorry?
"
4,14,33,Woman 2:,"You must have a mirror finish. Like Walker Cronkite: ""And that's how it is.""
"
4,14,34,Rochelle:,"What is yours?
"
4,14,35,Robin:,"I always ended up with a simple ""all of us at Metro News One, have a great evening.""
"
4,14,36,Barney:,"Mine: ""From all of us in Barney's apartment, get out.""
"
4,14,37,Lily:,"You do not let these bitches destabilize you, right?
"
4,14,38,Robin:,".. and the president's economic team hopes to have a proposal before Congress by the end of the month. All of us at News 10, have a great evening. So, good night, New York.And that the road ahead is illuminated in dreams and tomorrows. Which are lit with dreams... also.
"
4,14,39,Ted:,"It's terrible. And bad... also.
"
4,14,40,Robin:,"It's not over.
"
4,14,41,Robin:,"Arise, New York. Trust. Recycle. Exit covered.
"
4,14,42,Marshall:,"Leave covered?
"
4,14,43,Robin:,"I will not be a presenter at Channel 10, right?
"
4,14,44,Barney:,"It just fell.
"
4,14,45,Ted:,"The problem may be your CV. Have you seen like mine is ventilated? Yours is too busy.
"
4,14,46,Robin:,"As if everything on your resume is so important?""Program Director, Radio Wesleyan University""?
"
4,14,47,Marshall:,"My God.
"
4,14,48,Lily:,"Dr. X? You always talk to Dr. X?
"
4,14,49,Robin:,"Who is Dr. X?
"
4,14,50,Ted:,"No one knows. It was a mysterious and awesome DJ.
"
4,14,51,Marshall:,"It was Ted.
"
4,14,52,Ted:,"His identity is still secret.
"
4,14,53,Lily:,"It was Ted.
"
4,14,54,Ted:,"But this phantom waves changed the face of the campus radio.
"
4,14,55,Marshall:,"It was Ted.
"
4,14,56,Lily:,"The show was zero.
"
4,14,57,Radio:,"Here Dr. X, bullets of truth from an undisclosed location. For if I knew where they would silence me.
"
4,14,58,Marshall:,"You're the 3rd floor of the home student next to the playroom, dork.
"
4,14,59,Radio:,"I received lots of letters for my story on the menus of racist school.
"
4,14,60,Lily:,"How do you receive mail if someone knows where you are, moron?
"
4,14,61,Radio:,"This is why I organize an event to the self, Monday at midnight. It is time that leaders of the canteen remove ignorance and injustice menus. (Someone from the person of the radio) Ted, we are missing a player. What are you doing here, anyway? Dude, get out of here! I'll be right. Remember, self, Monday, midnight. Another event Dr. X. I'll be there, because X leaves its mark...
"
4,14,62,Marshall:,"If you think people liked your show, it's wrong...
"
4,14,63,Barney:,"Bizarre. Look at what is mixed with your fan mail.
"
4,14,64,Robin:,"What?
"
4,14,65,Barney:,"It comes from the Ministry of Immigration.
"
4,14,66,Robin:,"The postmark date of two months. My God.
"
4,14,67,Lily:,"What has he?
"
4,14,68,Robin:,"My work permit. If I can not find a job in the coming...seven days, they will refer me to Canada.
"
4,14,69,Barney:,"I can not believe you that turns the country.
"
4,14,70,Robin:,"I know. My whole life is here.
"
4,14,71,Ted:,"No. We will not let them. One of us will help you find.
"
4,14,72,Lily:,"Yes, I'm sure I can find you something at school.
"
4,14,73,Marshall:,"No, guys... it does not work like that. Robin will have its license if it works in his field. You could stay if you got married to a U.S. citizen. Yes, it might work. No. The procedure to formalize it would take too much time. It will not work.
"
4,14,74,Robin:,"I'm screwed. I send my demo for 3 months and nothing.
"
4,14,75,Ted:,"Maybe there is something in it that people do not like.We'll watch it, OK?
"
4,14,76,Robin:,"Good question, Norm. For the first, I was an intern for Channel 22 in Red Deer. Alberta. In Canada. The snow falls hard enough, but these intrepid fishermen are still happy to contribute to the gathering of bass fishing Lake Athabasca, a tradition of 1 August To you, Norm. What? It was my first job. It shows where I come from.
"
4,14,77,Barney:,"Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo.
"
4,14,78,Marshall:,"No, no, I understand. Your origins are part of what you sell. Moreover, in 'Special jurisdiction' on my resume, I put that in Minnesota, I was dunk champion Nicollet County in 1995.
"
4,14,79,Ted:,"You've put champion dunk in your CV?
"
4,14,80,Marshall:,"Yes, why not? Many companies have a basketball team. They like that TonnerreVanille can still crash into the net.
"
4,14,81,Robin:,"We called you TonnerreVanille?
"
4,14,82,Marshall:,"Yeah, TonnerreVanille. The ghost of snowshoes.The gate man. I was not very good in defense.
"
4,14,83,Ted:,"You can dunk more.
"
4,14,84,Marshall:,"Bine sure if. Finally, I could... until there is little.
"
4,14,85,Lily:,"Until the injury.
"
4,14,86,Doctor:,"It's tendonitis of the iliopsoas.
"
4,14,87,Lily:,"Wow, it's scary.
"
4,14,88,Doctor:,"More commonly known as the dancer's hip.
"
4,14,89,Marshall:,"Go! Iliopsoas tendinitis. This is the name. This is the only name.
"
4,14,90,Marshall:,"iliopsoas tendinitis. It's a basketball injury. Finally, nothing incredible.
"
4,14,91,Lily:,"The dancer's hip, Marshall's ax dancer.
"
4,14,92,Marshall:,"OK, no. They call it like that because it is very common among ballet dancers.
"
4,14,93,Robin:,"Tell me, other girls in your class have the dancer's hip?
"
4,14,94,Marshall:,"Sure.
"
4,14,95,Ted:,"I have a technical question. Is it easier to dance when you do not have external genitalia?
"
4,14,96,Marshall:,"Well, go ahead, feel free to me.
"
4,14,97,Lily:,"Come on, guys. It did not hurt while dancing.
"
4,14,98,Marshall:,"Thank you, Lily.
"
4,14,99,Lily:,"Obviously, the stirrups were too far apart during his last visit to the gynecologist.
"
4,14,100,Barney:,"Folks, sorry to stop you before Marshall falls into tears, but Robin, check it out. What you need is a super video resume. Like mine. I present to you: Barneysvideocv.com.(The video starts with an explosion) Hello. Barney Stinson, you have achieved great successes in business, sport and personal relationships, and have been an inspiration to many people.
"
4,14,101,Ted:,"Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself?
"
4,14,102,Barney:,"How could that be me? He is an Englishman. What would you recommend to your many admirers who want to reach the peak of their potential?
"
4,14,103,Ted:,"And a little Scottish.
"
4,14,104,Barney:,"The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset.
"
4,14,105,Ted:,"You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that?
"
4,14,106,Barney:,"And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit.
"
4,14,107,Marshall:,"You know you stand next to a horse. Impressive.
"
4,14,108,Lily:,"Barney, I do not understand. You doing anything in these clips.
"
4,14,109,Barney:,"Exactly. Because that's what the world wants to work.People who seem to take risks, but never do anything. In fact, you do things will turn. I write a book about this phenomenon.
"
4,14,110,Marshall:,"Really?
"
4,14,111,Barney:,"No, it would be... You listen? All my life I have dared to go beyond the possible. Until the impossible? In fact, beyond that... where the possible and the impossible meet to become... the possimpossible.
"
4,14,112,Lily:,"The possimpossible? Oh yeah?
"
4,14,113,Barney:,"Inventing your own word shows creativity and vision...""Visia-ness."" If I can leave you with one thought, is this one: nothing... and all... is possimpossible. (Several assembly passes with a song) This guy is awesome.
"
4,14,114,Ted:,"It's you again...? You sing a song about you?
"
4,14,115,Barney:,"Absolutely not. It would be stupid. Stinson, Barney Stinson singing this song, it would be really stupid. One of the fans who think this guy is awesome. Perfect and available.Great, Great, Great, Great, Great, Great... Great, great. Barney Stinson, committed. This jewel has earned me 11 jobs.
"
4,14,116,Ted:,"Impossible.
"
4,14,117,Lily:,"Barney, it was ridiculous and foolish.
"
4,14,118,Marshall:,"insensate-ule.
"
4,14,119,Robin:,"Make me one.
"
4,14,120,Lily:,"What?
"
4,14,121,Barney:,"Now, we talk about it.
"
4,14,122,Robin:,"What? I will be deported. I would try anything.
"
4,14,123,Barney:,"OK, we should get started. I have much to shoot, I can not use the tapes I have of you.
"
4,14,124,Robin:,"Bands on me?
"
4,14,125,Barney:,"Let's start.
"
4,14,126,Lily:,"Honey. You're always sorry for the joke of the dancer?They joked. We all know that this is a basketball injury.
"
4,14,127,Marshall:,"Yes, absolutely. I have something to say.
"
4,14,128,Lily:,"What?
"
4,14,129,Marshall:,"I dance more than you think.
"
4,14,130,Lily:,"What?
"
4,14,131,Marshall:,"I dance... more than you think.
"
4,14,132,Lily:,"I do not know how to answer that.
"
4,14,133,Barney:,"What does it mean to be a reporter for you?
"
4,14,134,Robin:,"Since I was little...
"
4,14,135,Barney:,"Cut! You're mired in details. We need you to be vague, at ease with buzzwords like ""synergy"" and ""dynamism"". You can invent a word, as... ""Relationality.""
"
4,14,136,Robin:,"How does make me feel stupid commit somewhere?
"
4,14,137,Barney:,"All right. Do not do it. There are many exciting stories to cover in Canada. I just read it, the nephew of the mayor of Winnipeg went fishing on the ice and took a pole of 7 Kg Live from the worst place in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
"
4,14,138,Robin:,"Rotate the camera. Connectitude.
"
4,14,139,Barney:,"I like it.
"
4,14,140,Robin:,"Transformatation.
"
4,14,141,Barney:,"Come on!
"
4,14,142,Robin:,"relationality.
"
4,14,143,Barney:,"relationality, this is mine.
"
4,14,144,Lily:,"How many dances are we talking about?
"
4,14,145,Marshall:,"I know. I think... I would say... average.
"
4,14,146,Lily:,"Why do you dance much, and I do not know why?
"
4,14,147,Marshall:,"I do that when I'm alone. When something good happens, and I'm excited and move, and I... I dunno, I want to talk about it.
"
4,14,148,Lily:,"You hurt the hip like that?
"
4,14,149,Man:,"You're aware of? They give us half a day. One can start at 14h.
"
4,14,150,Marshall:,"Super! Thank you, Herm.
"
4,14,151,Robin:,"These clothes are ridiculous. In addition, the armor of the amazon princess itch.
"
4,14,152,Barney:,"Showdown. You're not the first to wear it here. But it expresses the power. And that, too. Now, I need you break these 15 bricks with your forehead.
"
4,14,153,Robin:,"What? But you do anything in your video. You were right next to a horse and sitting on a motorcycle.
"
4,14,154,Barney:,"I am a man. You're a woman. Assume that you can do nothing. You must prove that society is wrong.
"
4,14,155,Robin:,"I can not break 15 bricks with my forehead.
"
4,14,156,Barney:,"There is more in 1950. Yes, you can.
"
4,14,157,Robin:,"I'm off.
"
4,14,158,Barney:,"Why?
"
4,14,159,Robin:,"It will not help me find a job. I'm going to evict. I know what to do. (Robin enters an office) This is where the auditions for the daughter of lottery?
"
4,14,160,Ted (2030):,"So your Aunt Robin had hit bottom. She auditioned to be the daughter of lottery.
"
4,14,161,Robin:,"And the lotto numbers for tonight are...
"
4,14,162,Man 1:,"Wait... Say the text before pressing the button.
"
4,14,163,Male 2:,"It creates suspense.
"
4,14,164,Man 1:,"It creates suspense.
"
4,14,165,Robin:,"And the lotto numbers for tonight are... 17...
"
4,14,166,Man 2:,"Stop it.
"
4,14,167,Man 1:,"Wait.
"
4,14,168,Man 2:,"Why she says like that? It's as if she did not care so that the 17. She looks nasty.
"
4,14,169,Man 1:,"Yes, she looks super wicked. You can repeat ""17"" for us?
"
4,14,170,Robin:,"17.
"
4,14,171,Man 2:,"I even understand what it does.
"
4,14,172,Man 1:,"Let me try something. Try to be a little disillusioned.
"
4,14,173,Robin:,"Disillusioned? On the 17th?
"
4,14,174,Man 1:,"Disillusioned with a small...
"
4,14,175,Man 2:,"crackling.
"
4,14,176,Man 1:,".. sparkle.
"
4,14,177,Robin:,"17.
"
4,14,178,Man 1:,"It was great!
"
4,14,179,Ted:,"I've taken a light beer. I know the dancers count calories.
"
4,14,180,Marshall:,"It's not funny. The doctor said if it gets worse, I should have surgery.
"
4,14,181,Ted:,"As a vaginal rejuvenation?
"
4,14,182,Marshall:,"You know who has not made a lot of vaginas in college?
"
4,14,183,Ted:,"Who?
"
4,14,184,Marshall:,"Dr. X.
"
4,14,185,Ted:,"It was perfect!
"
4,14,186,Lily:,"You know what? The two geniuses are going to remove that crap on their CV. You're not Dr. X, and you can not do the dunk. Forget.
"
4,14,187,Ted:,"Marshall and I are the only ones here with sh1t on our resume?
"
4,14,188,Lily:,"What are you insinuating?
"
4,14,189,Marshall:,"I know! Does July 4, 1995 does remind you of anything?
"
4,14,190,Lily:,"A species of b*st*rd.
"
4,14,191,Referee:,"End! And the new champion with 29 hot dogs, Lily ""The Belly"" Aldrin.
"
4,14,192,Ted:,"What it's related to your job as mistress?
"
4,14,193,Lily:,"It teaches kids... I can eat a lot of hot dogs very quickly.
"
4,14,194,Marshall:,"Yes, but you can not!
"
4,14,195,Lily:,"You can dunk over, hip cardboard!
"
4,14,196,Marshall:,"How dare you? These hips can...
"
4,14,197,Ted:,"Guys!
"
4,14,198,Robin:,"I have not even been taken as the daughter of lottery. I must leave Canada.
"
4,14,199,Lily:,"I think so.
"
4,14,200,Robin:,"I remember the night before. They made me a farewell party. They gave me a camera to take pictures and send them home. Everyone was sure I will have much success. You will really miss.
"
4,14,201,Barney:,"What's the matter?
"
4,14,202,Ted:,"Robin must leave Canada.
"
4,14,203,Barney:,"Oh, my God. It's horrible. It'll be along to commute.
"
4,14,204,Robin:,"What do you mean?
"
4,14,205,Barney:,"I've finished your video resume myself. I posted it to all channels of the city. A guy called from Channel 8. He adores you. He wants you to pass an audition.
"
4,14,206,Robin:,"My God!
"
4,14,207,Barney:,"I said no. Robin Scherbatsky do not audition. He is given the job or anything.
"
4,14,208,Robin:,"So, I have the job.
"
4,14,209,Barney:,"No. He cursed me and hung up. But after Channel 12, called. They'll love it too. They offer you to host their new talk show in the morning.
"
4,14,210,Robin:,"It's amazing!
"
4,14,211,Barney:,"I sent them sh1t.
"
4,14,212,Robin:,"Dude!
"
4,14,213,Barney:,"They want you even more. So they increased their offer by 10%. Congratulations. Looks like you'll have to stay.
"
4,14,214,Lily:,"You're not going to dance?
"
4,14,215,Marshall:,"It's OK. Later.
"
4,14,216,Robin:,"How did you do that?
"
4,14,217,Barney:,"I am the master of possimpossible.
"
4,14,218,Robin:,"Yes. Thank you.
"
4,14,219,Ted (2030):,"So, thanks to your uncle Barney, it was possible to keep your Aunt Robin. And the others decided it was time to drop some things. Finally, except Lily.
"
4,14,220,Marshall:,"That one is good. And... end! What is the total?
"
4,14,221,Ted:,"33!
"
4,14,222,Ted:,"Why nobody comes to my events?
"
4,2,1,Ted from 2030:,"When I first moved to New York, it was dingy, disgusting, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky and altogether terrifying, but then, sadly. The whole city started to go uphill. The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank.
"
4,2,2,Barney:,"Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!
"
4,2,3,Ted:,"Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?
"
4,2,4,Barney:,"Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? (He throws one to Ted.) Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.
"
4,2,5,Lily:,"Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.
"
4,2,6,Ted from 2030:,"That was the plan, anyway. (We can see Marshall in front of the mirror of the bathroom.) Over the next few weeks, Marshall went on a lot of interviews.
"
4,2,7,Marshall (to the mirror):,"You are confident, you are energetic, you are focused!
"
4,2,8,Ted from 2030:,"A lot of interviews.
"
4,2,9,Marshall(to the mirror):,"You are flexible on salary, you're willing to compromise, you're not gonna cry this time.
"
4,2,10,Ted from 2030:,"Too many interviews.
"
4,2,11,Marshall(to the mirror):,"You are sad, you are beaten down, you will get through this, come home, get in your big underpants and take a nap.
"
4,2,12,Ted from 2030:,"Which brings us to September 29, the night of the burger.
"
4,2,13,Ted:,"So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?
"
4,2,14,Wendy:,"Oh, we just got a new cook. You have to try the burger, it's amazing.
"
4,2,15,Robin:,"Great, we'll take five of those.
"
4,2,16,Wendy (taking note):,"Five burgers.
"
4,2,17,Ted:,"Really? You want to eat here?
"
4,2,18,Robin:,"Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse.
"
4,2,19,Marshall:,"I thought you started that yesterday.
"
4,2,20,Robin:,"I finished early, OK? (To Wendy) Five of those.
"
4,2,21,Wendy:,"Five burgers.
"
4,2,22,Ted:,"Wait. What about sushi?
"
4,2,23,Lily:,"We had sushi last night.
"
4,2,24,Barney:,"Italian.
"
4,2,25,Ted:,"I had Italian for lunch.
"
4,2,26,Wendy:,"I can come back.
"
4,2,27,Robin:,"No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?
"
4,2,28,Ted:,"Chinese?
"
4,2,29,Robin:,"Oh.
"
4,2,30,Barney:,"I don't like Chinese.
"
4,2,31,Ted:,"Indian?
"
4,2,32,Barney:,"I just said I don't like Chinese.
"
4,2,33,Ted:,"Indian isn't Chinese.
"
4,2,34,Barney:,"Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?
"
4,2,35,Ted:,"Mexican?
"
4,2,36,Barney:,"I just said I don't like Chinese.
"
4,2,37,Robin:,"God.
"
4,2,38,Wendy:,"Robin, yours will be right out.
"
4,2,39,Robin:,"Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me.
"
4,2,40,Everybody:,"Sweet! You shouldn't have. That's so kind of you.
"
4,2,41,Lily:,"My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas.
"
4,2,42,Ted:,"It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder.
"
4,2,43,Barney:,"I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.
"
4,2,44,Marshall:,"It's okay.
"
4,2,45,Everybody:,"Are you kidding me?
"
4,2,46,Marshall:,"Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet.
"
4,2,47,Robin:,"And you've had the best burger in New York?
"
4,2,48,Marshall:,"It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place.
"
4,2,49,Marshall:,"Oh, thank God it's just you.
"
4,2,50,Ted:,"You are being ridiculous. (Taking the bat.) Tell me, you left the apartment today?
"
4,2,51,Marshall:,"Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini? (Laughing) It's disgusting.
"
4,2,52,Ted:,"Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.
"
4,2,53,Marshall:,"What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang.
"
4,2,54,Ted:,"That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.
"
4,2,55,Marshall:,"No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable.
"
4,2,56,Ted:,"Go outside, go, go.
"
4,2,57,Marshall:,"Okay. (He takes the bat discreetly.)
"
4,2,58,Ted:,"Leave the bat.
"
4,2,59,Marshall:,"Fine.
"
4,2,60,Marshal:,"So I went for a walk in the big, scary city. And I discovered something amazing: it wasn't scary at all. All right. What's the word?
"
4,2,61,Man in the street (Distributing pamphlets):,"Your search is over!
"
4,2,62,Marshall:,"And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...
"
4,2,63,Marshall:,"And there it was.
"
4,2,64,Barney:,"Name two places where things get stuffed.
"
4,2,65,Marshall:,"So, I went inside.
"
4,2,66,Marshall voiceover:,"And I ordered the burger.
"
4,2,67,Marshal:,"Thank you.
"
4,2,68,Marshall:,"Ted, you got to wake up. Wake...
"
4,2,69,Ted:,"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
"
4,2,70,Marshall:,"I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude.
"
4,2,71,Ted:,"I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?
"
4,2,72,Marshall:,"I don't know. (Looking to his watch.) Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9:30?
"
4,2,73,Marshall voiceover:,"So we went out to get another burger. But after hours of searching...
"
4,2,74,Marshall (Raising hands in the sky.):,"Damn it! Where is this place?
"
4,2,75,Robin:,"You couldn't find it?
"
4,2,76,Ted:,"We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.
"
4,2,77,Marshall:,"Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?
"
4,2,78,Robin:,"Where do you think it was?
"
4,2,79,Lily:,"Probably tucked between her legs.
"
4,2,80,Barney:,"You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.
"
4,2,81,Marshall:,"Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger.
"
4,2,82,Man:,"I couldn't help but overhear.
"
4,2,83,Marshall:,"Okay, here we go.
"
4,2,84,Man:,"I know the place you're talking about.
"
4,2,85,Marshall:,"No, you don't.
"
4,2,86,Man:,"It's a place called the Corner Bistro. Greatburger.
"
4,2,87,Marshall:,"Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee: Starbucks.
"
4,2,88,Robin:,"So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.
"
4,2,89,Marshall:,"Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her.
"
4,2,90,Marshall (getting up):,"We're going.
"
4,2,91,Marshall:,"But none of those places even came close.
"
4,2,92,Ted:,"There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?
"
4,2,93,Barney:,"Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.
"
4,2,94,Marshall (Watching Ted):,"The autographed picture.
"
4,2,95,Regis Philbin (Lifting weights):,"Of course I remember the place. It was the best burger I ever had. I still have dreams about this burger. Beautiful, haunting dreams! I wake up at night screaming, ""Get out of my head, burger! Get out!""
"
4,2,96,Marshall:,"That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?
"
4,2,97,Regis Philbin(He knocks in a bag of boxing.):,"No! I never wrote it down. But not a day goes by that I don't regret it. (To Marshall) Why? Why? Do you know where it is?
"
4,2,98,Marshall:,"No.
"
4,2,99,Regis Philbin (Threatening him with his fists.):,"And if you tell me it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna smack you right in the face!
"
4,2,100,Barney:,"No. No, we don't know where it is.
"
4,2,101,Regis Philbin (Taking Barney by the collar):,"Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat.
"
4,2,102,Barney:,"I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!
"
4,2,103,Regis Philbin (To Marshall):,"What about you, Lurch? (To Ted) And what about you, satchel-mouth? (Giving a card to Barney) This is my cell. You find that burger; you call me day or night.
"
4,2,104,Barney:,"OK, Regis, we will, we will.
"
4,2,105,Regis Philbin:,"hat are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!
"
4,2,106,Barney:,"All right.
"
4,2,107,Regis Philbin:,"Let's go, all of you!
"
4,2,108,Marshall:,"That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says ""Burger.""
"
4,2,109,Robin:,"Green door, red neon sign that says ""Burger?""
"
4,2,110,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
4,2,111,Robin:,"I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.
"
4,2,112,Marshall:,"I knew it was on a numbered street!
"
4,2,113,Robin:,"Finally.
"
4,2,114,Marshall (taking Robin's burger in his hands):,"No! Robin! If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight, it's gonna be the best burger in New York. We're going downtown! He throws away the burger.
"
4,2,115,Robin:,"No...
"
4,2,116,Marshall:,"I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger
"
4,2,117,Lily:,"Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.
"
4,2,118,Barney:,"You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.
"
4,2,119,Lily:,"Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.
"
4,2,120,Barney:,"How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs.
"
4,2,121,Ted:,"We should probably call Regis.
"
4,2,122,Barney:,"Reg... (He takes his phone.) That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text.
"
4,2,123,"""Million Dollar:","Heads or Tails"" - Studio set
"
4,2,124,Regis Philbin:,"Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads. The one before that was tails. You polled the audience; they came out split, 50/50. No help at all there. So, for $258,000... I have to ask you, Kathy, what's it gonna be: heads...or... (His phone rings, he reads the text and starts to leave the studio.) Excuse me. Oh, boy. I've got to go. I've got to go!
"
4,2,125,Marshall:,"Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.
"
4,2,126,Robin (On nerves):,"I will eat your hand.
"
4,2,127,Marshall:,"et's just go inside then. Shall we?
"
4,2,128,Marshall (to the waitress):,"Thank you.
"
4,2,129,Waitress:,"ours will be right out.
"
4,2,130,Robin:,"Please, go ahead, start.
"
4,2,131,Robin:,"Just shut up and eat.
"
4,2,132,Barney:,"All right.
"
4,2,133,Ted:,"Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.
"
4,2,134,Lily:,"I think I just had my first burg-asm.
"
4,2,135,Barney:,"I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?
"
4,2,136,Marshall (putting his burger in his plate):,"This isn't it.
"
4,2,137,Everybody:,"What?
"
4,2,138,Marshall:,"It's not it.
"
4,2,139,Ted:,"Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same
"
4,2,140,Robin:,"I mean, it is just a burger.
"
4,2,141,Marshall:,"Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive ""pas de deux"". And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.
"
4,2,142,Lily:,"And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.
"
4,2,143,Marshall:,"Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says ""Burger"". I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.
"
4,2,144,Robin:,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.
"
4,2,145,Lily:,"Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job.
"
4,2,146,Ted:,"Tell them about the underpants.
"
4,2,147,Robin:,"What about the underpants?
"
4,2,148,Lily:,"It started a couple of weeks ago.
"
4,2,149,Marshall:,"Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.
"
4,2,150,Lily:,"Hey, baby.
"
4,2,151,Marshall:,"Hey!
"
4,2,152,Lily:,"Did you put on pants today?
"
4,2,153,Marshall:,"Nope. They laugh.
"
4,2,154,Lily:,"It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, ""Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that."" Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.
"
4,2,155,Ted:,"Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.
"
4,2,156,Robin:,"How big is Marshall's underpants radius?
"
4,2,157,Marshall:,"We're going.
"
4,2,158,Ted:,"Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.
"
4,2,159,Barney:,"You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. ""We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank."" Member FDIC.
"
4,2,160,Lily:,"We've got to find Marshall that burger.
"
4,2,161,Ted:,"Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.
"
4,2,162,Robin:,"I'm not eating that burger.
"
4,2,163,Lily:,"No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it.
"
4,2,164,Robin:,"Finally.
"
4,2,165,Lily:,"Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate.
"
4,2,166,Waitress:,"Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and ""Burger"" sign.
"
4,2,167,Ted:,"What? Uptown? Where?
"
4,2,168,Waitress:,"106th and Manhattan Avenue.
"
4,2,169,Robin:,"Damn it.
"
4,2,170,Marshall:,"106. A numbered street. Of course.
"
4,2,171,Barney:,"Barney Stinson.
"
4,2,172,Regis Philbin (in front of the last restaurant):,"Barney, where the hell are you?
"
4,2,173,Barney:,"I'm sorry, this is...?
"
4,2,174,Regis Philbin:,"Regis. I'm at the place.
"
4,2,175,Barney:,"Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.
"
4,2,176,Regis Philbin:,"What? Uptown? He breaks a mail box. Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20. If you get there first, medium rare.
"
4,2,177,Barney:,"Onions?
"
4,2,178,Regis Philbin (screaming):,"Onions?
"
4,2,179,Barney:,"Okay, no onions.
"
4,2,180,Marshall:,"Stop the cab!
"
4,2,181,Marshall:,"Wait. This is it.
"
4,2,182,Man in the streets:,"Your search is over. We got girls taking off their clothes.
"
4,2,183,Marshall:,"This is it.
"
4,2,184,Barney:,"One of 9,000 convenient locations.
"
4,2,185,Marshall:,"It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.
"
4,2,186,Robin:,"I don't understand. Where is the burger place?
"
4,2,187,Ted:,"It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.
"
4,2,188,Robin (getting crazy):,"That's fine. Let's just eat here.
"
4,2,189,Ted:,"We can't eat here. It's an ATM.
"
4,2,190,Robin:,"But... food.
"
4,2,191,Barney:,"What the...
"
4,2,192,Lily:,"This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.
"
4,2,193,Barney:,"It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily.
"
4,2,194,Lily:,"I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!
"
4,2,195,Barney:,"Marshall, Geez.
"
4,2,196,Lily:,"They suck, suck!
"
4,2,197,Barney:,"Will you just tell her already?
"
4,2,198,Lily:,"Tell me what? Tell me what?
"
4,2,199,Marshall:,"I got a job.
"
4,2,200,Lily:,"What? Where?
"
4,2,201,Marshall:,"Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.
"
4,2,202,Barney:,"Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.
"
4,2,203,Lily:,"But you want to be an environmental lawyer.
"
4,2,204,Marshall:,"Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.
"
4,2,205,Lily:,"You've got great pants.
"
4,2,206,Marshall:,"I love you.
"
4,2,207,Lily:,"I love you.
"
4,2,208,Ted:,"Robin, no!
"
4,2,209,Robin:,"They're unopened.
"
4,2,210,Ted:,"Give it.
"
4,2,211,Robin:,"They're barbecue.
"
4,2,212,Ted:,"Give it!
"
4,2,213,Lily:,"I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.
"
4,2,214,Marshall:,"It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.
"
4,2,215,Man:,"You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks.
"
4,2,216,Robin (Licking an envelope.):,"A hundred bucks? That's crazy.
"
4,2,217,Marshall:,"Let's pay the man.
"
4,2,218,Lily:,"I paid for the cab.
"
4,2,219,Ted:,"I have any cash.
"
4,2,220,Marshall:,"I haven't worked since March.
"
4,2,221,Barney:,"If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.
"
4,2,222,Barney:,"Member FDIC.
"
4,2,223,Ted from 2030:,"So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later...
"
4,2,224,Marshall:,"Thank you.
"
4,2,225,Ted:,"All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?
"
4,2,226,Marshall:,"This is it.
"
4,2,227,Everybody:,"Yes!
"
4,2,228,Marshall:,"It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up.
"
4,2,229,Ted from 2030:,"And so, after finally tasting again the burger he'd craved for so many years, Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants, and went to work, and he never looked back.
"
4,2,230,Lily:,"I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there.
"
4,2,231,Robin:,"Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.
"
4,2,232,Barney:,"This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.
"
4,2,233,Marshall:,"If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.
"
4,2,234,Regis Philbin:,"This isn't it.
"
4,2,235,Everybody:,"What? Come on.
"
4,2,236,Barney:,"That's outrageous.
"
4,2,237,Regis:,"That is unbelievable. Wait. This is it!
"
4,2,238,Marshall:,"You were just freakin' teasing us.
"
4,2,239,Regis:,"No, really.
"
4,16,1,Ted (2030):,"In 2009, your Aunt Robin had a morning show.She had to get up early enough. At what point?
"
4,16,2,1:,"5, Robin joined Barney, Ted, Marshall and Lily to McClaren's.
"
4,16,3,Robin:,"Hello, everyone.
"
4,16,4,Marshall:,"So you do really? You really gonna go to work at 2am.
"
4,16,5,Robin:,"I do not for me. I do it for the fans.
"
4,16,6,Marshall:,"Who is a fan of a program broadcast at 4am?
"
4,16,7,Lily:,"Those with a show at 5am?
"
4,16,8,Ted:,"The addicts who have not sold their TV?
"
4,16,9,Barney:,"The strippers in this weird time between work and waking the children?
"
4,16,10,Robin:,"They are. Put me know. It's been what?
"
4,16,11,Marshall:,"You know, as usual.
"
4,16,12,Barney:,"Really, as usual.? Think the funniest thing that ever happened.
"
4,16,13,Robin:,"It's good.
"
4,16,14,Barney:,"And twice that.
"
4,16,15,Robin:,"So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?
"
4,16,16,Barney:,"Something even funnier happened to Marshall today.
"
4,16,17,Marshall:,"First, nothing is funnier than that. Then it's not such a good story.
"
4,16,18,Robin:,"Come on, guys. You are four young people active in the most exciting city in the world. And you have nothing to tell me?
"
4,16,19,Lily:,"What do you want? Sometimes it's like that. The same thing over and over again. One of my students ate glue.
"
4,16,20,Barney:,"I have used questionable methods to skip a very silly girl.
"
4,16,21,Ted:,"My ex, Karen, is in New York. The usual routine.
"
4,16,22,Lily:,"Karen is here?
"
4,16,23,Barney:,"You're kidding me!
"
4,16,24,Ted (2030):,"Children, I think you talked about Karen.
"
4,16,25,Ted (2030):,"It was my girlfriend in high school and at times in college. She was beautiful, intelligent. I was crazy in love with her. The only problem, Marshall and Lily were not. It should probably come out of this as soon as we opened.
"
4,16,26,Karen:,"I like you live in a dorm. It's so American. Like eating rotten sandwiches and be racist.
"
4,16,27,Lily:,"My God, it was a real idiot.
"
4,16,28,Marshall:,"Dude, the gold medal of the andouille de Vire.
"
4,16,29,Ted:,"It was not that bad.
"
4,16,30,Lily:,"Of course, for you. You had it turned into a zombie of andouille.
"
4,16,31,Marshall:,"I want to eat your brain, but only if it is organic and free range.
"
4,16,32,Ted:,"What?
"
4,16,33,Lily:,"You pass me the salt?
"
4,16,34,Karen:,"The salt? It's so bourgeois.
"
4,16,35,Ted:,"Bluntly.
"
4,16,36,Karen:,"What is this?
"
4,16,37,Marshall:,"It's... a TV.
"
4,16,38,Karen:,"I not watch TV.
"
4,16,39,Ted:,"Bluntly.
"
4,16,40,Karen:,"You thought I would buy tickets to WrestleMania? It was ironic.
"
4,16,41,Ted:,"Bluntly.
"
4,16,42,Marshall (disguised):,"I know... you was ironic. Me too... I'm ironic.
"
4,16,43,Lily (arriving disguised):,"Let's go! What?
"
4,16,44,Marshall:,"This makeup has one month to go. I met with parents of Lily. I have never looked so stupid.
"
4,16,45,Barney:,"So far. Tells the story, tells the story!
"
4,16,46,Marshall:,"Get off me!
"
4,16,47,Robin:,"Wait. It's really funny?
"
4,16,48,Barney:,"I'm not kidding. I almost do not want you to hear, because really, for the rest of your life, nothing will ever be as fun and you, curse you for agreeing to hear. You gotta hear it.This is too funny.
"
4,16,49,Marshall:,"Okay.
"
4,16,50,Marshall:,"This morning I was in the gymnasium of the box to play basketball. The guys from work can be quite violent with their taunts.
"
4,16,51,Bilson:,"Look Wisniewski. He will cry. Look at him.
"
4,16,52,Man:,"Look at him.
"
4,16,53,Marshall:,"I think that the knees are made to bend like that. He may have torn his cruciate ligament.
"
4,16,54,Bilson:,"Dude, all that he has torn, that's her uterus or maybe her hymen.
"
4,16,55,Man:,"Yeah, or the fallopian tube.
"
4,16,56,Marshall:,"I can be a bit watered down dialogue, whatever...
"
4,16,57,Marshall:,"I searched my bag to get my stuff working...
"
4,16,58,Barney:,"Wait. Expect. I want to say.
"
4,16,59,Marshall:,"Okay. Say it.
"
4,16,60,Barney:,"He searched his bag to get his stuff, and... No, say it.It's more fun if you say so. Let me say it. No, say it. You say.Say it. At the same time. No, go ahead.
"
4,16,61,Marshall:,"I forgot...
"
4,16,62,Barney:,"He forgot his pants!
"
4,16,63,Barney:,"He forgot his pants.
"
4,16,64,Robin:,"He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey.
"
4,16,65,Ted:,"So, Karen in New York. Bizarre, no?
"
4,16,66,Lily:,"You can not get back with Karen.
"
4,16,67,Ted:,"I never said I'd do that. I thought it arrives. That would be the worst disaster if I called?
"
4,16,68,Marshall:,"It is not the worst, no. That would be the fourth worst.1: Super volcano. 2: An asteroid falls to Earth. 3: Any record of Evel Knievel is lost. 4: Ted called Karen. 5: Lily is eaten by a shark.
"
4,16,69,Lily:,"My name is Lily and I approve this order. You know the story. Ted and Karen had a rocky relationship in college. It always happened like this. They were having fun, being obnoxious until one day...
"
4,16,70,Ted:,"You find pepperoni fascist and you're so right, so... (He finds Karen in bed with another) Oh, my God! Karen!
"
4,16,71,Man:,"Sorry, dude.
"
4,16,72,Karen:,"Before you say a word, I think you should read Les Fleurs du Mal by Baudelaire.
"
4,16,73,Marshall:,"After that, they broke. Ted was totally depressed, and we waited the necessary time to tell him what we thought of it.
"
4,16,74,Ted:,"I broke up with Karen.
"
4,16,75,Lily:,"They hated it!
"
4,16,76,Marshall:,"Bye bye, the slut!
"
4,16,77,Lily:,"Then Ted went up the noggin and took the bus to Providence to tell Karen's four truths.
"
4,16,78,Marshall:,"How was it?
"
4,16,79,Ted:,"Super. Look who's here!
"
4,16,80,Marshall and Lily:,"Karen.
"
4,16,81,Lily:,"And finally, all over again from scratch.
"
4,16,82,Ted:,"It's gonna be 10,002 Maniacs, because I have tickets to Natalie Merchant...
"
4,16,83,Man:,"Sorry, dude.
"
4,16,84,Robin:,"She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room?
"
4,16,85,Barney:,"Respect.
"
4,16,86,Ted:,"I was an idiot. It was my first real girlfriend. I was crazy about her. We've all done things we regret in college. In the third year, Marshall has grown the goatee, wearing a beret and Rasta required to be called MJ Cool.
"
4,16,87,Marshall:,"I regret it at all.
"
4,16,88,Ted:,"So you really think that I should not call?
"
4,16,89,Robin:,"No.
"
4,16,90,Marshall:,"Go back in your little head it.
"
4,16,91,Ted:,"OK, OK. Interesting information: it is already done.
"
4,16,92,Lily:,"Are you kidding!
"
4,16,93,Barney:,"The pants!
"
4,16,94,Lily:,"I can not believe that thou hast called. Why do not you invite him to lunch as you're at it?
"
4,16,95,Ted:,"Because I will not invite him to lunch... again.
"
4,16,96,Lily:,"You have to lunch?
"
4,16,97,Marshall:,"Why do you want to lunch with an ex?
"
4,16,98,Barney:,"Good question, there are four reasons for a ""meal ex '.1: They want to get back together.
"
4,16,99,Lily:,"As my high school boyfriend, Scooter.
"
4,16,100,Lily:,"The Lilium, not stupid. Sorry, I have no scooter for you.
"
4,16,101,Scooter:,"This is super funny! I forgot your humor.
"
4,16,102,Lily:,"It is this server?
"
4,16,103,Scooter:,"Why? You like the servers? I can be a waiter. I will become the best server in the world, and you'll love me!
"
4,16,104,Barney:,"2: They want to kill you. As my lunch with Wendy.
"
4,16,105,Wendy:,"Happy is that way at last. You know, after you have rejected nine times, I almost drop.
"
4,16,106,Barney:,"But you did not do it, you've continued to insist.
"
4,16,107,Wendy:,"Actually, there is one thing I wanted to give you.
"
4,16,108,Barney:,"Gun! She's got a gun!
"
4,16,109,Wendy:,"It's a tie!
"
4,16,110,Barney:,"3: They make you really want your business.
"
4,16,111,Robin:,"As my lunch with Curt.
"
4,16,112,Curt:,"Actually, there is one thing I wanted to give you.
"
4,16,113,Robin:,"My short-barreled 38 Special Police! I knew that I had left it somewhere. Every time I watch the news, I pray it is not my gun.
"
4,16,114,Curt:,"We did well to break.
"
4,16,115,Barney:,"Or four: You taunt with their success.
"
4,16,116,Marshall:,"As my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.
"
4,16,117,Robin:,"Who is Nicole Barsamian?
"
4,16,118,Marshall:,"My ex.
"
4,16,119,Marshall:,"Hi, Nicole.
"
4,16,120,Nicole:,"You look good.
"
4,16,121,Marshall:,"You look pretty.
"
4,16,122,Nicole:,"I see someone.
"
4,16,123,Marshall:,"Already? Who?
"
4,16,124,Nicole:,"Lee Roberts. He already reads like a CM2.
"
4,16,125,Marshall:,"You must cancel the luncheon.
"
4,16,126,Ted:,"I'd do that, of course... if he had not already occurred.
"
4,16,127,Lily:,"Robin, I will have to borrow the butt of your gun.
"
4,16,128,Robin:,"I still lost. You come to believe?
"
4,16,129,Lily:,"How can you break bread with this chick?
"
4,16,130,Ted:,"It was a lunch and not eat wheat. It was nice to be back.We even laughed at the idiots we were.
"
4,16,131,Karen:,"Say I had a beret different every day.
"
4,16,132,Ted:,"Say I had a picture of Moliere on my backpack.
"
4,16,133,Karen:,"It was pretentious.
"
4,16,134,Ted:,"Bluntly pretentious.
"
4,16,135,Waiter:,"What would you like?
"
4,16,136,Karen:,"I want to make a scene, but in your list of wines, there is a Chateauneuf-du-Pape listed under ""C&ocirc;tes de Provence"".You should tell your waiter.
"
4,16,137,Waiter:,"And for you?
"
4,16,138,Ted:,"I hate change, but take us brushettes and fresh mozzarella. Grazie.
"
4,16,139,Ted:,"It was great. There was an odd moment near the end.
"
4,16,140,Robin:,"How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal.
"
4,16,141,Barney:,"And a hug is like a hug in public.
"
4,16,142,Marshall:,"You must embrace strangely.
"
4,16,143,Lily:,"What has happened?
"
4,16,144,Ted:,"So...
"
4,16,145,Karen:,"Schopenhauer had a discussion daring, in which he opposed...
"
4,16,146,Lily:,"Ted, darling. Go outside and bite the curb. I arrive in 1 minute.
"
4,16,147,Ted:,"Karen was the first girl I really loved. And after the year I had, I dunno, I think of lunch with her reminded me what it was to turn 18 and life ahead. And I would remind everyone that at least I was wearing pants.
"
4,16,148,Marshall:,"You can not change the subject like that.
"
4,16,149,Robin:,"The pants.
"
4,16,150,Barney:,"The pants! The pants!
"
4,16,151,Marshall:,"It was nothing! I had a small problem, so I called Lily.
"
4,16,152,Barney:,"Tell us, what was this concern?
"
4,16,153,Marshall:,"I forgot my pants.
"
4,16,154,Lily:,"What do you mean you forgot your pants?
"
4,16,155,Marshall:,"I forgot. You have a bringest me.
"
4,16,156,Lily:,"And the spare.
"
4,16,157,Marshall:,"Last Thursday, the mustard? You have a goldfish memory.
"
4,16,158,Lily:,"Ted, you're not going out so easily. While the history of pants is fun...
"
4,16,159,Barney:,"Fun? Rather, very fun.
"
4,16,160,Lily:,"That's nothing compared to this crazy thing with Karen.Ends.
"
4,16,161,Ted:,"That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant.
"
4,16,162,Lily:,"Why do you say ""the restaurant""? You've embraced elsewhere?
"
4,16,163,Ted:,"As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem?
"
4,16,164,Marshall:,"You did what?
"
4,16,165,Barney:,"How could you?
"
4,16,166,Lily:,"Marshall forgot his pants today, and yet you are the stupidest in this table.
"
4,16,167,Ted:,"Lily, let's be honest. We know both your motives. You hate Karen because she lingered.
"
4,16,168,Lily:,"Asshole.
"
4,16,169,Robin:,"What do you mean by linger?
"
4,16,170,Lily:,"February 5,... In 1998. I painted...
"
4,16,171,Karen:,"I'm sorry. Sorry. (She goes out then comes back) The color palette is a bit derivative of the first Van Gogh, right?
"
4,16,172,Lily:,"Ted Horn, critique my painting, anything, that's your business. But I catch you eyeing the mess of my guy and you lingered? You'll be received well.
"
4,16,173,Robin:,"The game is the game
"
4,16,174,Marshall:,"In his defense, I had just the muscle.
"
4,16,175,Ted:,"Why paint naked?
"
4,16,176,Lily:,"He had eaten my fruit bowl. The fact is that Karen is a dirty pervert, you can not bring into our lives.
"
4,16,177,Ted:,"Relax, it was just one night! And three after. And one morning. But at least I had pants. Even if, in fact, I had not.
"
4,16,178,Robin:,"It happened to us? Where was I?
"
4,16,179,Ted:,"You know the sleeping pills you take for your crazy schedule? They are stronger than you think.
"
4,16,180,Robin:,"Do not worry. I will say nothing to Marshall.
"
4,16,181,Karen:,"I'll have a beer. You want one? A beer. I decanted Bordeaux.
"
4,16,182,Barney:,"Ted, that's for sure, it's fun to look back when you were a farm girl fresh complexion and a virgin. But all that stuff... Ohio, Karen, in college... it was A.S. ""Before Stinson."" Now your life is great! Okay, you still live with your ex, which is ridiculous. Laser tag your skills are almost nonexistent. And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking?
"
4,16,183,Robin:,"What is the result with the bimbo?
"
4,16,184,Marshall:,"It's a foregone conclusion. Ted is Charlie Brown trying to shoot and Karen, it's Lucy who takes away the ball at the last second and sleeping with. You have understood me.Ted falls in love, and Karen is going wrong with a playboy, who says... ""Sorry, dude.""
"
4,16,185,Ted:,"False! You got to let the right answer in your pants, because that's exactly what did not happen.
"
4,16,186,Ted (2030):,"Because that's what happened.
"
4,16,187,Ted (2030):,"An afternoon at Karen.
"
4,16,188,Man:,"My God. How could you?
"
4,16,189,Ted:,"Sorry, dude.
"
4,16,190,Ted (2030):,"This time, the playboy with whom she deceived...
"
4,16,191,Ted:,"That was me. Me. The one time Marshall forgot his pants?
"
4,16,192,Marshall:,"Damn! Stop changing the subject. You have gone too far. You are complicit in breaking the heart of this poor guy.And you, you are best placed to know how it feels.
"
4,16,193,Robin:,"You really do speak of your pants?
"
4,16,194,Marshall:,"What?
"
4,16,195,Barney:,"Pant, pant...
"
4,16,196,Marshall:,"Okay! Lily came to the office to bring me my pants...
"
4,16,197,Barney:,"Why she did this?
"
4,16,198,Marshall:,"Because I forgot.
"
4,16,199,Barney:,"Lily, what are you doing here?
"
4,16,200,Lily:,"I just give something to Marshall.
"
4,16,201,Barney:,"He ""give"" something. Understood. Nice.
"
4,16,202,Lily:,"But I'm in a hurry. I can give it to you?
"
4,16,203,Barney:,"Of course, yes.
"
4,16,204,Lily:,"And you give him?
"
4,16,205,Barney:,"Wait. I do not know. Yours had better be really good.
"
4,16,206,Lily:,"What are you talking?
"
4,16,207,Barney:,"What about you?
"
4,16,208,Lily:,"Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one.
"
4,16,209,Barney:,"He forgot his pants. Good thing you came because today it has an important meeting, and it would be embarrassing and not at all funny if it were to show no pants. I will make sure he has.
"
4,16,210,Lily:,"Awesome. Thank you.
"
4,16,211,Ted:,"And you did not give him.
"
4,16,212,Barney:,"Theodore Evelyn Mosby. Of course I gave him. I gave him my word. It is concrete. For cons, I made a few alterations.
"
4,16,213,Marshall:,"As you can see on page 44 of the contract...
"
4,16,214,Bilson:,"Since when you are in AC / DC?
"
4,16,215,Marshall:,"You can look at page 44 of the contract?
"
4,16,216,Man:,"Auditions for Oliver Twist are down!
"
4,16,217,Barney:,"Please, can I have more... pants?
"
4,16,218,Barney:,"More...
"
4,16,219,Robin:,"Is that all? It's the story?
"
4,16,220,Marshall:,"What has happened to Karen?
"
4,16,221,Lily:,"I'll finish for you. Ted left without saying anything, and Karen got exactly what she wanted.
"
4,16,222,Ted:,"Not this time.
"
4,16,223,Ted:,"You have a boyfriend?
"
4,16,224,Karen:,"It's a moment you move away. I intended to break.
"
4,16,225,Ted:,"You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all.
"
4,16,226,Karen:,"OK, you're right. I'm good in literature. Gifted in art.Good at identifying a French wine for less than a kilometer from where the grapes grew. But... I'm really bad to watch someone and say what I feel.
"
4,16,227,Ted:,"We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye.
"
4,16,228,Karen:,"Ted, wait. In fact, ""good bye"" means ""until we see each other again."" So I guess you mean that in fact, we'll meet again?
"
4,16,229,Ted:,"Sorry, dude.
"
4,16,230,Robin:,"I am impressed. For you too have worn it all day?
"
4,16,231,Marshall:,"It shows my calves.
"
4,16,232,Barney:,"The pants. Still tells.
"
4,16,233,Lily:,"You know, this is perhaps good that you called Karen.
"
4,16,234,Ted:,"Of course. And that for me, too. Later, she spoke with Jerry, and the discussion was that it avoided breaking with me.
"
4,16,235,Ted (2030):,"You see, children, sometimes when you have to have a difficult discussion, the better to do...
"
4,16,236,Lily:,"Wait a minute. You said that you never reparlerais him?So how do you know she has followed your advice?
"
4,16,237,Ted:,"Right. On this subject... After breaking up with this guy, we went out, we slept since we're together. It's really okay, this time it's different. Here it is. Be nice!
"
4,17,1,Ted (2030):,"In March 2009, I went out a few weeks with my high school girlfriend, Karen. My friends were not really happy.
"
4,17,2,Karen:,"Hi all.
"
4,17,3,All:,"Hi.
"
4,17,4,Ted:,"Sorry, can not stay.
"
4,17,5,Barney:,"It's unfortunate!
"
4,17,6,Robin:,"Disgusted!
"
4,17,7,Karen:,"They are real diamonds?
"
4,17,8,Robin:,"Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you.
"
4,17,9,Karen:,"I did not say that I loved.
"
4,17,10,Robin:,"I got a great deal...
"
4,17,11,Karen:,"I'm sure that minors exploited in Sierra Leone you would type in five if they still had their fingers. But it's nice.Meet me at the top.
"
4,17,12,Robin:,"They need a finger to do what I think.
"
4,17,13,Marshall:,"Ted, Karen is an idiot.
"
4,17,14,Ted:,"Nice set of forms.
"
4,17,15,Marshall:,"I put the forms there.
"
4,17,16,Ted:,"Believe it or not, my friends do not have a say on which I frequent. This is my life. I decide.
"
4,17,17,Karen:,"Now!
"
4,17,18,Ted:,"I arrive.
"
4,17,19,Barney:,"I do not know what it is, this shrew. Okay, she has boobs, but... In fact, I see.
"
4,17,20,Lily:,"That's because he met her in high school. This is his first girlfriend.
"
4,17,21,Marshall:,"For us, Karen is an idiot. For him, this is the first to have touched his pen1s in hand himself, his mother and pediatrician.
"
4,17,22,Robin:,"It's almost 2am. I must work.
"
4,17,23,Lily:,"How can they call it a ""daily""? 4h, it's still the middle of the night. You impressed me.
"
4,17,24,Robin:,"It's been almost a month. I'm used to. And then the show is not bad, right?
"
4,17,25,Marshall:,"That is clear.
"
4,17,26,Barney:,"I've never seen.
"
4,17,27,Robin:,"You've ever watched?
"
4,17,28,Marshall:,"Sure!
"
4,17,29,Barney:,"I've never seen.
"
4,17,30,Robin:,"Your favorite item?
"
4,17,31,Marshall:,"Weather.
"
4,17,32,Barney:,"I've never seen.
"
4,17,33,Robin:,"Have you ever looked.
"
4,17,34,Marshall:,"Sorry.
"
4,17,35,Barney:,"I just said.
"
4,17,36,Robin:,"I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look.
"
4,17,37,Marshall:,"You know what? This Friday, everyone will come home at 3:30. We leave the pajamas and watch his show.
"
4,17,38,Robin:,"You're the best.
"
4,17,39,Lily:,"We want to encourage you.
"
4,17,40,"Friday, 3:","0, Marshall, Lily and Barney are in the lounge.
"
4,17,41,Lily:,"I just want to sleep!
"
4,17,42,Marshall:,"I hate Robin not to have done better.
"
4,17,43,Ted:,"Hi, guys. Bad news: I was Karen plated. Go ahead.
"
4,17,44,Marshall:,"I knew you were listening!
"
4,17,45,Barney:,"We should not celebrate. Ted has just been dumped.Tell us everything, everything that happened. Seriously, do not forget any details. She said what? You, you said what? How you going? If you had to redo it from start, perhaps you...?
"
4,17,46,Lily:,"How did that happen?
"
4,17,47,Ted:,"This is totally stupid. We were together, you know, we laughed...
"
4,17,48,Ted:,"It's you who love the Chianti 2002.
"
4,17,49,Karen:,"No, it's you who love the Chianti 2002. Expect. What is this?
"
4,17,50,Ted:,"Looks like the earring Robin. Bizarre. It's you...
"
4,17,51,Karen:,"What's she doing here?
"
4,17,52,Ted:,"I know.
"
4,17,53,Karen:,"Have you slept with Robin?
"
4,17,54,Ted:,"What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry.
"
4,17,55,Karen:,"Why I believe you?
"
4,17,56,Ted:,"Maybe because I've always been faithful, when thou hast deceived me 6 times, bitch.
"
4,17,57,Marshall:,"In your face!
"
4,17,58,Ted:,"Right? I too would have said that.
"
4,17,59,Karen:,"Why I believe you?
"
4,17,60,Ted:,"Maybe because I've always been faithful, while you... I love you...
"
4,17,61,Karen:,"I knew it was a mistake. It's good. It's over.
"
4,17,62,Ted:,"That's it. She's gone.
"
4,17,63,Barney:,"What a story. What courage to share it with us.
"
4,17,64,Lily:,"Wait. That's your pajamas? You sleep in pajamas suit?
"
4,17,65,Barney:,"Of course. You think I'm sleeping in it?
"
4,17,66,Ted:,"A coffin.
"
4,17,67,Marshall:,"It's not look comfortable at all. You wear a tie.
"
4,17,68,Barney:,"First, it's a tie night. Second, it's not for comfort. This class is to be at any time.
"
4,17,69,Marshall:,"Why have the class at any time?
"
4,17,70,Barney:,"Let me tell you a story that happened to me recently.
"
4,17,71,Woman 1:,"It is a contest of ""who is the hottest,"" and it was stained with massage oil.
"
4,17,72,Woman 2:,"Super pajamas.
"
4,17,73,Woman 1:,"You can use your shower?
"
4,17,74,Ted:,"It's not an anecdote, it's a porno.
"
4,17,75,Lily:,"This is not ""a"" skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it.
"
4,17,76,Barney:,"But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it.
"
4,17,77,Marshall:,"Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally...
"
4,17,78,Barney:,"Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, ""Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? ""It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, ""Held danger of Ninja,"" if you want. You stay still a transvestite.
"
4,17,79,Marshall:,"I do not care. It's comfortable.
"
4,17,80,Barney:,"Nice to fly to Neverland with Peter Pan? Me, again! It was nice to get out of bed to accompany Charlie to the chocolate? Oh, me, me! Something about Scrooge! Come on, guys. I do all the work.
"
4,17,81,Ted:,"I know. I live with Marshall for 12 years. Every time I put something, it's a victory.
"
4,17,82,Lily:,"Ted, it will start!
"
4,17,83,Ted:,"I arrive.
"
4,17,84,Robin:,"Hello, New York. I'm Robin...
"
4,17,85,Ted:,"Marshall, I found an earring Robin on your dresser. You know why the other was in my bed?
"
4,17,86,Marshall:,"What are you talking?
"
4,17,87,Ted:,"You hate Karen. You told me to break it. It's you. Did you put the loop in my bed for Karen to find.
"
4,17,88,Marshall:,"I would never...
"
4,17,89,Ted:,"Admit it!
"
4,17,90,Marshall:,"There's nothing to admit!
"
4,17,91,Ted:,"Why was it on your dresser?
"
4,17,92,Barney:,"It is pretty!
"
4,17,93,Ted:,"I swear, if you tell me the truth on the field...
"
4,17,94,Lily:,"Wait! Marshall did nothing. It's me. I made you break.
"
4,17,95,Ted:,"You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that?
"
4,17,96,Lily:,"I did it for your own good. You do not see how it was horrible. She failed the test of the porch.
"
4,17,97,Ted:,"What is this test?
"
4,17,98,Lily:,"You, Me and Marshall are friends since college. Imagine how they account for one another. So when I look to the future, I see us all together. (Lily imagines the scene) When will retirees, sipping tea on the porch of our house, playing bridge all day.
"
4,17,99,"Lily, old:","Bridges are wild. A bridge of four beats a royal bridge.
"
4,17,100,"Ted, old:","I see your bridges and I raise of 3 bridges.
"
4,17,101,"Marshall, old:","Bridge! I won!
"
4,17,102,Barney:,"You know not to play bridge, eh?
"
4,17,103,Lily:,"It will take over.
"
4,17,104,Marshall:,"It's important to stay active.
"
4,17,105,Lily:,"So whenever you go out with someone for a while, I take the test of the porch. How that person will fit over the years?And when I think of Karen...
"
4,17,106,"Marshall, old:","Bridge! I won!
"
4,17,107,"Karen, old:","Fantastic. Yet the bridge. Especially, not reading.
"
4,17,108,"Ted, old:","Look, darling... dolphins.
"
4,17,109,"Karen, old:","They seem happy. Apparently, the chemical releases of this property have not yet elitist rotten their vents. It will happen. This water will kill you. A real trap toxic.
"
4,17,110,"Lily, old:","I'm going swimming.
"
4,17,111,"Marshall, old:","I'm coming with you.
"
4,17,112,Lily:,"Karen has failed the test of the porch. She had to leave.
"
4,17,113,Ted:,"I can not believe you did that.
"
4,17,114,Lily:,"Do you like is great, you, me and Marshall. Really, think about it.
"
4,17,115,Ted:,"It's pretty awesome.
"
4,17,116,Lily:,"It is really great! So for that you will marry, one that will join the Team G√©niale, the bar is very high. I say that I did well, but...
"
4,17,117,Marshall:,"You're better off without her.
"
4,17,118,Barney:,"If the angel Clarence says it's true, it should be.
"
4,17,119,Marshall:,"You know what? Go ahead, laugh.
"
4,17,120,Barney:,"Why are you wearing this stuff?
"
4,17,121,Marshall:,"Several reasons.
"
4,17,122,Barney:,"You can not even give five.
"
4,17,123,Marshall:,"A: You can not wear anything underneath.
"
4,17,124,Ted:,"I confirm. You can cross your legs?
"
4,17,125,Marshall:,"Two: It's sexy.
"
4,17,126,Lily:,"I confirm. You can uncross your legs?
"
4,17,127,Marshall:,"Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?
"
4,17,128,Barney:,"I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress.
"
4,17,129,Lily:,"So you're really angry?
"
4,17,130,Ted:,"I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better.
"
4,17,131,Lily:,"I'm really sorry. I hated to do it again, but Karen had to leave.
"
4,17,132,Ted:,"""Redo""? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends?
"
4,17,133,Lily:,"Never! Six.
"
4,17,134,Ted:,"Like who?
"
4,17,135,Lily:,"No one! Angie. In the second year. She used you to get revenge on her ex, and you will not see it, so...
"
4,17,136,Lily:,".. one day she was taking a nap...
"
4,17,137,Ted:,"Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.
"
4,17,138,Marshall:,"That's where is my CD of Creed.
"
4,17,139,Ted:,"Who else?
"
4,17,140,Lily:,"Do you remember this strange girl who wanted you to marry him after two months? You loved him in trouble, but you thought there anyway, so...
"
4,17,141,Woman:,"Look, Ted, you're great, and it is very difficult, but I think it does not look the same. So, long life and prosperity. Or something else.
"
4,17,142,Ted:,"That was you? It's crazy!
"
4,17,143,Lily:,"Ted, I did it to help you. You're addicted to the commitment. You fell in love with these women, even if they do not deserve you.
"
4,17,144,Ted:,"And if one of them was to be the mother of my children?
"
4,17,145,Lily:,"If there was any chance, I swear, I would have done anything. As Victoria or Stella.
"
4,17,146,Ted:,"Or Robin. Or Robin. You made us break too? You made us break too?
"
4,17,147,Lily:,"Stop talking to me as if I were your enemy! You know these women cry, but you have the luxury of not knowing what I know: you have these breaks tragic surely avoided a first marriage crap and very expensive.
"
4,17,148,Ted:,"You have made us break up?
"
4,17,149,Lily:,"You do not want the truth, because deep down, you want me to watch over you. And basically, you know that none of these women would have been the mother of your children.
"
4,17,150,Ted:,"You have made us break up?
"
4,17,151,Lily:,"I did what I had to do.
"
4,17,152,Ted:,"You have made us break up?
"
4,17,153,Lily:,"Just as I did!
"
4,17,154,Barney by nightdress:,"Your grandfather was a wise Olaf.
"
4,17,155,Ted:,"You made me break with Robin?
"
4,17,156,Lily:,"No, it's not...
"
4,17,157,Ted:,"I can not believe it. I need another drink.
"
4,17,158,Barney:,"I feel a little breeze there. It's nice.
"
4,17,159,Marshall:,"You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.
"
4,17,160,Barney:,"The Little Barney says ""Mahalo.""
"
4,17,161,Ted:,"Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that?
"
4,17,162,Lily:,"I did it because I care about you!
"
4,17,163,"Robin, entering:","Too glad you watched that one!
"
4,17,164,Barney:,"My God, what has happened?
"
4,17,165,Robin:,"You have not seen the show?
"
4,17,166,Barney:,"The show! Sorry. It happened something?
"
4,17,167,Robin:,"The routine.
"
4,17,168,Ted:,"Lily has just told us it made us break.
"
4,17,169,Robin:,"What? We do break? What does that mean? And why they wear a night gown?
"
4,17,170,Marshall:,"A shirt.
"
4,17,171,Barney:,"It's called a shirt.
"
4,17,172,Ted:,"It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.
"
4,17,173,Lily:,"Robin was different. I did not mean that you break, but you wanted different things and you refused to settle it. I could imagine the porch.
"
4,17,174,"Ted, old:","2 of heart. As the heart of two children that I have ever had, because my lovely wife hates children.
"
4,17,175,"Robin, old:","Equality. As my career that fell when I decided to settle down and marry Ted. Bridge! I won.
"
4,17,176,Marshall:,"I do not like this scenario.
"
4,17,177,Lily:,"I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break.
"
4,17,178,Lily:,"I have a funny joke. Where you see yourself in five years?(Later that night, Lily is with Robin at McClaren's) You know what's funny? Funny questions. Where you see yourself in five years?
"
4,17,179,Ted:,"Where do you see yourself in five years?
"
4,17,180,Robin:,"And you?
"
4,17,181,Lily:,"Not that I want to make you say, but surely you want to get married.
"
4,17,182,Ted:,"I would probably get married.
"
4,17,183,Lily:,"You would surely be in Tokyo or Paris.
"
4,17,184,Robin:,"I would surely be in Argentina.
"
4,17,185,Ted:,"In Argentina?
"
4,17,186,Robin:,"Or Tokyo, or Paris.
"
4,17,187,Ted:,"We have a deadline, does not it?
"
4,17,188,Robin:,"My God.
"
4,17,189,Ted:,"You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back!
"
4,17,190,Lily:,"I was not...
"
4,17,191,Ted:,"I want to hear!
"
4,17,192,Barney:,"Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?
"
4,17,193,Marshall:,"Come, let's check.
"
4,17,194,Robin:,"So, without you we would come out still together?
"
4,17,195,Lily:,"Or you'd been together too long, and would have had an incredibly bitter break without even remain friends, and we would never become best friends.
"
4,17,196,Robin:,"Do not say that.
"
4,17,197,Ted:,"Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you.
"
4,17,198,Lily:,"It is what happened to your jacket?
"
4,17,199,Robin:,"Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?
"
4,17,200,Barney:,"You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?
"
4,17,201,Marshall:,"Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid.
"
4,17,202,Barney:,"Tell me about marriage.
"
4,17,203,Marshall:,"Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.
"
4,17,204,Barney:,"The coffee too?
"
4,17,205,Marshall:,"The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.
"
4,17,206,Barney:,"I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?
"
4,17,207,Marshall:,"It says you're great and everything will be fine.
"
4,17,208,Barney:,"It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?
"
4,17,209,Marshall:,"I guess. If you have agreed, perhaps. The guy had a hard day. We'll talk tomorrow. Good night, champ.
"
4,17,210,Ted (2030):,"The next night, I always wanted your aunt Lily.Until...
"
4,17,211,Karen:,"What are you doing... (She kisses him before he finished his sentence) Lily rose and explained everything to me. And she gave me this for you.
"
4,17,212,Lily:,"Ted, I'm sorry. No matter who you marry. I know it will be great because she will think you are. To prove my sincerity, I have prepared a surprise for you and Karen at the top. Kisses, Lily.
"
4,17,213,Marshall:,"PS: Sorry that the envelope is opened. I read what she wrote. Marshall.
"
4,17,214,Karen:,"Sabotaging our relationship? I must admit that even setting the bar really low for judging friends, Lily really outdid themselves. Clearly, we can not see her again. I know. It's hard, huh?
"
4,17,215,"Karen, old:","Do you remember your college roommate? He was married to this girl's voice rattle.
"
4,17,216,"Ted, old:","It's been so long.
"
4,17,217,"Karen, old:","My God, I hated him. Finally, here is his obituary.
"
4,17,218,Ted:,"I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.
"
4,17,219,Robin:,"So, it's over?
"
4,17,220,Ted:,"Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lily is a sacred stove.
"
4,17,221,Robin:,"beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house.
"
4,17,222,Ted:,"Normal Marshall dies at age 68.
"
4,17,223,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
4,17,224,Ted (2030):,"And with Robin, we're treated to a gourmet dinner.For her breakfast. And we ended up doing exactly what Lily wanted us to do: talk about our relationship.
"
4,17,225,Robin:,"Basically, Lily made us break.
"
4,17,226,Ted:,"It makes you wonder.
"
4,17,227,Robin:,"If it had not been there, we always go out together?
"
4,17,228,Ted:,"Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case.
"
4,17,229,Robin:,"We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone...
"
4,17,230,Ted:,"Will you be my wife back?
"
4,17,231,Robin:,"A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!
"
4,17,232,Ted:,"Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?
"
4,17,233,Robin:,"Genre?
"
4,17,234,Ted:,"I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing.
"
4,17,235,Robin:,"Just one thing: no nightgown.
"
4,17,236,Ted:,"I'll never wear.
"
4,17,237,Woman:,"Too bad.
"
4,3,1,Ted (2030):,"During the fall of 2008, I had a little problem.
"
4,3,2,Barney:,"Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick.
"
4,3,3,Ted:,"Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?
"
4,3,4,Barney:,"Hi, Ted.
"
4,3,5,Ted (2030):,"I lived in New York, but Stella was living across the river in New Jersey...
"
4,3,6,Ted:,"Oh, no!
"
4,3,7,Ted (2030):,".. So I took the train all the time.
"
4,3,8,Man:,"What's up, Ted?
"
4,3,9,Ted:,"Hi, Matisse.
"
4,3,10,Marshall:,"Theodore!
"
4,3,11,Barney:,"T-Diddy! You've missed that!
"
4,3,12,Lily:,"Robin has had the job of presenter.
"
4,3,13,Robin:,"And we have a free bottle of champagne.
"
4,3,14,Marshall:,"But it's empty now.
"
4,3,15,Ted:,"Oh, no!
"
4,3,16,Ted (2030):,"So, it was always as if I missed any.
"
4,3,17,Stella:,"Sorry, we could not wait. It cooled.
"
4,3,18,Ted:,"Oh, no!
"
4,3,19,Lucy:,"Hey, big.
"
4,3,20,Ted:,"What's up, G?
"
4,3,21,Stella:,"Are you okay?
"
4,3,22,Ted:,"Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train.
"
4,3,23,Stella:,"Exactly, why not you invited your friends to come here?
"
4,3,24,Ted:,"It's a great idea.
"
4,3,25,Marshall:,"You want us to go in New Jersey? Oh, that's great.
"
4,3,26,Ted:,"Why?
"
4,3,27,Barney:,"First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago.
"
4,3,28,Ted:,"Lily?
"
4,3,29,Lily:,"I'm sorry, Ted. I am a New Yorker pure juice. I am programmed to despise and hate New Jersey and all it represents. Why I say that? You hate him more than anyone.
"
4,3,30,Ted:,"What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that?
"
4,3,31,Ted:,"And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey.
"
4,3,32,Ted:,"Great, huh?
"
4,3,33,Marshall:,"It's waiting for you?
"
4,3,34,Ted:,"No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey.
"
4,3,35,Ted:,"So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body.
"
4,3,36,Lily:,"Ted, if you murdered me and bury me in New Jersey, I'll haunt thee for ever.
"
4,3,37,Ted:,"And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else?
"
4,3,38,Lily:,"I'll leave you alone. I'm sure you had your reasons.
"
4,3,39,Ted (2030):,"Children, your Aunt Robin was tired of his job, tired of lousy production...
"
4,3,40,Robin:,"I am Robin Scherbatsky, and you look... (The Metro M falls) Etro New One to 23h. (Thus the one from 11 pm) And again at 1am.
"
4,3,41,Ted (2030):,".. tired of the stories she had to announce.
"
4,3,42,Robin:,"So hurry up and vote for the cutest dog in New York.
"
4,3,43,Ted (2030):,".. and most of all, fed up with stupid puns.
"
4,3,44,Robin:,"Four workers were electrocuted when a subway train derailed. Stay here for more... de-rail shocking. Joel, people died.
"
4,3,45,Ted (2030):,"So, when she knew she was national presenter, she could finally say the words she longed to say for years.
"
4,3,46,Robin:,"Tonight is my last issue. I arrived in Metro New One as a small caterpillar. And for 4 years, this office was my cocoon.But tonight, I turned into a butterfly ambitious.
"
4,3,47,Marshall:,"Why it looks silly? She had a stroke?
"
4,3,48,Ted:,"Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good.
"
4,3,49,Robin:,"With an eye on the horizon, a look at the truth, and an eye on you all.
"
4,3,50,Lily:,"It's you who wrote, right?
"
4,3,51,Ted:,"This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem.
"
4,3,52,Marshall:,"You wore towels.
"
4,3,53,Ted:,"It's part of the team.
"
4,3,54,Ted (2030):,"This Saturday, when Robin left for his first day, we crossed the river to experience the amazing nightlife of New Jersey.
"
4,3,55,Ted:,"Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome.
"
4,3,56,Stella:,"Well, there are games, there are movies. And there shall be beer in the garage.
"
4,3,57,Marshall:,"It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.
"
4,3,58,Barney:,"Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian.
"
4,3,59,Marshall:,"No snakes on that plane.
"
4,3,60,Ted:,"Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary?
"
4,3,61,Lily:,"With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.
"
4,3,62,Barney:,"You can be at 22h.
"
4,3,63,Lily:,"No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey.
"
4,3,64,Stella:,"You really hate this part.
"
4,3,65,Marshall:,"What? No!
"
4,3,66,Stella:,"No, I understand, you're New Yorkers, you need a bar.You could go to the coolest bar in the state, which is so close that you will not believe it. (They descend the basement) and bang, here. The coolest bar in New Jersey.
"
4,3,67,Lily:,"Yeah, probably.
"
4,3,68,Ted:,"That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.
"
4,3,69,Barney:,"No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!
"
4,3,70,Ted:,"For torturlute? You're right.
"
4,3,71,Barney:,"Marshall.
"
4,3,72,Marshall:,"You deserve better than that.
"
4,3,73,Barney:,"Lily.
"
4,3,74,Lily:,"Not good enough.
"
4,3,75,Barney:,"Stella.
"
4,3,76,Stella:,"Sorry.
"
4,3,77,Barney:,"I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not.
"
4,3,78,Stella:,"Who wants to play Scrabble?
"
4,3,79,Lily:,"Yes, why not.
"
4,3,80,Stella:,"Look, the letter ""X"" is a bit difficult to read because a few years ago, she walked into my dog. You know, we should get a dog when you come to live here.
"
4,3,81,Ted:,"When I what?
"
4,3,82,Stella:,"Super. This is Robin.
"
4,3,83,Lily:,"I thought they came to live with you.
"
4,3,84,Ted:,"Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?
"
4,3,85,Barney:,"Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!
"
4,3,86,Ted:,"I can not live here.
"
4,3,87,Marshall:,"It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.
"
4,3,88,Barney:,"Air Hockey. Well done my fat.
"
4,3,89,Ted:,"I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months.
"
4,3,90,Ted:,"I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here.
"
4,3,91,Stella:,"Yeah, it could play in the fire escape, be friend with the guy who sleeps on a couch in the driveway, biking on Broadway. Great idea, Ted.
"
4,3,92,Ted:,"I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.
"
4,3,93,Barney:,"Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle.
"
4,3,94,Robin:,"Stella has already warned me.
"
4,3,95,Marshall:,"So, your first day?
"
4,3,96,Robin:,"It was not.
"
4,3,97,All:,"What?
"
4,3,98,Robin:,"It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.
"
4,3,99,Barney:,"How so?
"
4,3,100,Robin:,"I know. He told me that I had had it.
"
4,3,101,Robin:,"I got it? I got it!
"
4,3,102,Voice:,"Let's be clear, when I say ""you"", I mean the interview.You have the interview. I do not want there to be confusion.You only maintenance. Not the job.
"
4,3,103,Robin:,"Thank you! Thank you!
"
4,3,104,Robin:,"I'll call and beg Joel for giving me my job.
"
4,3,105,Marshall:,"No!
"
4,3,106,Lily:,"You hate that job.
"
4,3,107,Robin:,"It was not so bad.
"
4,3,108,Lily:,"How they made you call the Hurricane Hector when he was pouring with rain?
"
4,3,109,Robin:,"A cycorde.
"
4,3,110,Marshall:,"You're in the eye of cycorde.
"
4,3,111,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
4,3,112,Barney:,"Naughty.
"
4,3,113,Robin:,"That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ""ethnic"". There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?
"
4,3,114,Barney:,"You can not.
"
4,3,115,Lily:,"You can compete with anyone. You're Robin Scherbatsky. Confident, strong, great. With super long legs that look great in shorts.
"
4,3,116,Robin:,"I called Joel.
"
4,3,117,Barney:,"If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http://www...
"
4,3,118,Robin:,"Come on. I will not call.
"
4,3,119,Stella (descending):,"not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time.
"
4,3,120,Barney:,"This is the look.
"
4,3,121,Ted:,"I can not live here. I hate being here. I would kill myself.
"
4,3,122,Marshall:,"New Jersey is not so bad. Stella has a lawn. You can have a lawn mower. They sell there. I've seen with a cup holder. I saw a deck chair with a cup holder. I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. You live in New Jersey, you will not have to hold a cup.
"
4,3,123,Ted:,"It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you.
"
4,3,124,Barney:,"I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200.
"
4,3,125,Lily:,"Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer.
"
4,3,126,Barney:,"$ 10 000.
"
4,3,127,Marshall:,"You'll be on the other side of the river. You'll be in New York all the time.
"
4,3,128,Ted:,"I'm sorry. You are in New York?
"
4,3,129,Woman:,"We lived in Manhattan.
"
4,3,130,Ted:,"Are you in town?
"
4,3,131,Woman:,"All the time.
"
4,3,132,Marshall:,"You see? All the time.
"
4,3,133,Ted:,"When was the last time?
"
4,3,134,Man:,"We dined with O'Rourke.
"
4,3,135,Ted:,"It's been closed for six years.
"
4,3,136,Woman:,"It's been a while. Funny, not that we lack.
"
4,3,137,Man:,"I guess is the New Jersey-vegans, now. Honey, look, T-shirt with dogs.
"
4,3,138,Ted:,"I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it.
"
4,3,139,Marshall:,"What do you think guys? Beagle, or Boston terrier?
"
4,3,140,Lily:,"It's the tears?
"
4,3,141,Barney:,"They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional.
"
4,3,142,Lily:,"Where is Robin?
"
4,3,143,Robin:,"Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.
"
4,3,144,Barney:,"Robin, hangs up. Do not do that.
"
4,3,145,Robin:,"Sorry, I know, OK?
"
4,3,146,Lily:,"If you hang up no...
"
4,3,147,Robin:,"Stop! Joel, this is Robin.
"
4,3,148,Joel:,"So, Ms. Papillon wants to return to his cocoon.
"
4,3,149,Robin:,"I'm sorry for saying all this stuff.
"
4,3,150,Joel:,"You can put your socks with your apology, for you have already been replaced. Brian is the makeup and it could not be more excited.
"
4,3,151,Biran:,"I can not do that. I can not do that.
"
4,3,152,Joel:,"Look, although I want to see what college is over for the camera, if you can be here for the 23h, you can get your job.
"
4,3,153,Robin:,"Ok, I have half an hour to arrive at the studio.
"
4,3,154,Lily:,"You can never be in town in 30 minutes.
"
4,3,155,Barney:,"Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it.
"
4,3,156,Robin:,"I bet on me. I bet I can be there for 23h.
"
4,3,157,She leaves home and takes Stella the bike that is on the porch. It is 10:,"1 p.m.. Marshall and Ted back.
"
4,3,158,Stella:,"You got the beer?
"
4,3,159,Ted:,"Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk.
"
4,3,160,Stella:,"And you registered?
"
4,3,161,Ted:,"No.
"
4,3,162,Stella:,"Why?
"
4,3,163,Ted:,"Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey.
"
4,3,164,Stella:,"What?
"
4,3,165,Ted:,"I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York.
"
4,3,166,Stella:,"My daughter goes to school here. All his friends are here. I have lived here all my life. My whole family is here. This is my house. I'm at the EPA. And since June 1, I am the deputy mayor.
"
4,3,167,Ted:,"Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro.
"
4,3,168,Stella:,"It moves not, end of discussion.
"
4,3,169,Ted:,"How does it ""end of discussion""? It never was.
"
4,3,170,Stella:,"That's what being a parent. I want to uproot Lucy.
"
4,3,171,Ted:,"People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world.
"
4,3,172,Stella:,"It is. New York is the largest city in the world. Where the dream come true and of pigeon sh1t tastes like tapioca. Want a little secret? New Jersey... is better than New York.
"
4,3,173,Ted:,"Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet.
"
4,3,174,Stella:,"New York is full of crazies, snobs and bad people. You know that once an old woman called me a slut and gave me a cat in his face? And you want to know if it's the same in New Jersey? 86th and Lex, right in front of your dear little Papaya King. The people of New Jersey are nice. This is the kind of place where you know your neighbors.
"
4,3,175,Ted:,"Hey, I know my neighbors!
"
4,3,176,Stella:,"Yes, that kind?
"
4,3,177,Ted:,"At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I.
"
4,3,178,Stella:,"Claxpamon?
"
4,3,179,Lily:,"It is called Paxton.
"
4,3,180,Ted:,"I love this guy.
"
4,3,181,10:,"7 p.m., Robin is the bike on the train.
"
4,3,182,Robin:,"Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I go to before I go down first.
"
4,3,183,Matisse:,"Do not spill Matisse.
"
4,3,184,Lily:,"Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more.
"
4,3,185,Barney:,"Oh, yes. Tape for safety.
"
4,3,186,Stella:,"It was Atlantic City.
"
4,3,187,Barney:,"You can not beat A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know.
"
4,3,188,Ted:,"New York has Greenwich Village.
"
4,3,189,Stella:,"New Jersey coast.
"
4,3,190,Barney:,"Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape!
"
4,3,191,Stella:,"Bruce Springsteen.
"
4,3,192,Ted:,"Sinatra.
"
4,3,193,Stella:,"It's in Hoboken... New Jersey.
"
4,3,194,Ted:,"But that city he sings? This is not ""Secaucus, Secaucus.""
"
4,3,195,10:,"6 p.m., Robin slalom between the cars.
"
4,3,196,Ted (2030):,"Children, believe it or not, but Aunt Robin swears it happened like this...
"
4,3,197,Lily:,"Look, Stella, I understand that coming from New Jersey, you think not to like New York, but believe me, Marshall did not believe it either, and now he would move for anything.
"
4,3,198,Marshall:,"I hate New York! Sorry, but it's true. Today, I passed PriceCo. You've already been? It's huge. The New York stores are cramped. When I turn, I spill something. I'm like a big monster out of the ocean to destroy bodegas.
"
4,3,199,Lily:,"but, Marshall, you love New York.
"
4,3,200,Marshall:,"Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?
"
4,3,201,Barney:,"Small town, big men, then tope.
"
4,3,202,Marshall:,"It is too noisy, all the time. Yes, it is the city that never sleeps. Well, I would sleep well. I'm tired for 8 years. Tired and scared, with black and blue marks on my elbows to try to keep between the gateway for elves. New Jersey's great. There are department stores, and lawn and you do not have to wear a cup. For the rest of your life. I'm not afraid to say so. I love New Jersey. Just kidding.
"
4,3,203,Ted:,"I understand, OK? I see what you mean. I guess... we could live in Brooklyn.
"
4,3,204,Stella:,"You know what, Ted... Live wherever you want. I do not care.
"
4,3,205,Barney:,"Silence embarrassed. Tope then.
"
4,3,206,Ted:,"Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?
"
4,3,207,Lucy:,"There was noise in the cellar.
"
4,3,208,Ted:,"Sorry. Go back to sleep.
"
4,3,209,Lucy:,"I can not sleep without a story.
"
4,3,210,Ted:,"Ok, I'll get your mom...
"
4,3,211,Lucy:,"Why do you not read me one?
"
4,3,212,Ted:,"Let's go.
"
4,3,213,Ted:,"I moved here.
"
4,3,214,Stella:,"Really?
"
4,3,215,Ted:,"Really. New Jersey wins.
"
4,3,216,10:,"9 p.m., Robin arrives at the studio of Metro New One.
"
4,3,217,Robin:,"Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York.
"
4,3,218,Barney:,"Look, it did.
"
4,3,219,Robin:,"Our story tonight, the baby panda at the zoo in Central Park made his first tooth today. I think that makes him a... Bear molar. Bear molar. Bear molar. You know what? It's really over for me. Good night, New York.
"
4,3,220,Lily:,"It really stops.
"
4,3,221,Barney:,"You think you're there for something?
"
4,3,222,Lily:,"I think so. Good job, Barney.
"
4,3,223,Barney:,"Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I killed my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!
"
4,3,224,Lily:,"What's the matter?
"
4,3,225,Robin:,"I have not officially got the job.
"
4,3,226,Lily:,"I'm sorry.
"
4,3,227,Robin:,"It's OK. They offer me another.
"
4,3,228,Ted:,"It's great. This is for what?
"
4,3,229,Robin:,"Foreign Correspondent. I... moved to Japan.
"
4,7,1,Barney:,"I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.
"
4,7,2,Ted:,"And those girls over there? They are cannon.
"
4,7,3,Barney:,"Absolutely not.
"
4,7,4,Lily:,"Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known.
"
4,7,5,Robin:,"You hate me?
"
4,7,6,Lily:,"A max.
"
4,7,7,Marshall:,"Barney, they are canon.
"
4,7,8,Barney:,"There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod.
"
4,7,9,Ted:,"Anything.
"
4,7,10,Barney:,"Look at it carefully. Individually.
"
4,7,11,Marshall:,"I know. The last one is kinda cute.
"
4,7,12,Lily:,"Yeah, really cute.
"
4,7,13,Barney:,"And this, my friends, is ""the effect cheerleaders."" Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed. (His phone rings) Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember.
"
4,7,14,Ted:,"What?
"
4,7,15,Barney:,"Apparently, I'll be a father.
"
4,7,16,Ted:,"You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?
"
4,7,17,Barney:,"It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow.
"
4,7,18,Lily:,"That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.
"
4,7,19,Barney:,"No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?
"
4,7,20,Ted (2030):,"When you're 30 and you're a couple, something weird happens.
"
4,7,21,Ted (2030):,"You start to see babies everywhere.
"
4,7,22,"Then a woman walks with a dog and a child on his stomach, followed by several puppies Marshall:","Go.
"
4,7,23,Ted (2030):,"Marshall and Lily caught baby fever. And their neighbors did not help.
"
4,7,24,Marshall:,"You have not lost a sock, little guy? This is probably the cutest little thing I've ever seen.
"
4,7,25,Woman:,"That's my little plug!
"
4,7,26,Ted (2030):,"That night, they had a serious discussion and hands-on children.
"
4,7,27,Lily:,"So if you have a baby, you think you can work less?
"
4,7,28,Marshall:,"No matter, it will be so cute, I'm going to exhaust the first day.
"
4,7,29,Lily:,"And for the money? It has a ton of debt.
"
4,7,30,Marshall:,"We count the unpaid bills on her pretty little fingers.Let's make a baby.
"
4,7,31,Lily:,"Now?
"
4,7,32,Ted (2030):,"There was just one problem.
"
4,7,33,Robin:,"Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch.
"
4,7,34,Marshall:,"So, Robin, when you're in for the job and apartment?
"
4,7,35,Robin:,"Are not you aware? I am a presenter on CNN. And I have made gold a terrace overlooking Central Park. Get out of your ass's head, Marshall.
"
4,7,36,Ted (2030):,"They realized that if they wanted to start a family, they had the plan.
"
4,7,37,Lily:,"Robin, would you mind not sleeping with Ted tomorrow night? I... prepares a special dinner for Marshall.
"
4,7,38,Marshall:,"Just a dinner. That's it. Nothing else.
"
4,7,39,Robin:,"Okay, but you better not be as they stuck together when I cans on the roof. ""My ears. The neighbors called the cops.You almost hit me. ""
"
4,7,40,Marshall:,"Enjoy it. It is a good time.
"
4,7,41,Barney:,"God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never... (His phone rings and people have turned to him) Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?
"
4,7,42,Barney:,"Good news! I'm not a father!
"
4,7,43,Marshall:,"Congratulations, buddy.
"
4,7,44,Barney:,"This is the best time of my life, Marshall. What I feel in having no children? I have never thought something like it as much. That's why I created a public holiday. Now, today is ""Day of Non-fathers.""
"
4,7,45,Marshall:,"You create a holiday?
"
4,7,46,Barney:,"Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?
"
4,7,47,Marshall:,"It looks like a big day of Valentine's Day.
"
4,7,48,Man:,"Hello, Stinson.
"
4,7,49,Barney:,"Hi. How are the children?
"
4,7,50,Man:,"Ready for tonight, Eriksen? Big merger.
"
4,7,51,Marshall:,"That's between me and my wife, sir.
"
4,7,52,Man:,"The meeting with Mr. Li Tonight.
"
4,7,53,Marshall:,"I thought it was a lunch.
"
4,7,54,Man:,"Yes, in China. This is a teleconference with the Chinese.I count on you.
"
4,7,55,Lily:,"Marshall?
"
4,7,56,Marshall:,"Baby. It's lunchtime in China.
"
4,7,57,Lily:,"Yeah.
"
4,7,58,Marshall:,"It's not a euphemism. Listen... Wait, what does that mean?
"
4,7,59,Lily:,"I know, hot bread, spicy pork? Stuff like that. You come not tonight, right? You shake your head for ""no""? That's what I thought.
"
4,7,60,Lily:,"Thank you for coming so quickly.
"
4,7,61,Robin:,"Are you okay? You looked upset on the phone.
"
4,7,62,Lily:,"Marshall and I, we took the decision to have a great...dinner. And I thought I was ready for a... dinner. But he called to cancel, and it got me thinking. Is it too early for us to make a... Dinner?
"
4,7,63,Ted:,"I had lunch early, so I can eat.
"
4,7,64,Lily:,"Dinner, it's a baby!
"
4,7,65,Robin:,"Lily, it's horrible!
"
4,7,66,Lily:,"No, I need you to clarify a situation for me.
"
4,7,67,Robin:,"What?
"
4,7,68,Lily:,"Are we ready, Marshall and me to have a baby? So, are we ready to have a baby or not?
"
4,7,69,Ted:,"We can not decide for you. It's huge.
"
4,7,70,Robin:,"You know what is huge? Marshall's head. It is as big as a watermelon in late August. Marshall's baby who is passing by?
"
4,7,71,Ted:,"He thinks what?
"
4,7,72,Robin:,"A lot of things in the helmet of the space of 50 years who serves as its head.
"
4,7,73,Lily:,"Marshall is really excited. But I think he sees only the good sides of it.
"
4,7,74,Lily:,"The other day while playing with the little Jeremy, I was talking with his mother.
"
4,7,75,Woman:,"Thank you for the invitation. It's been a while since I have not told an adult. Well, except my husband. But ""For you to change"" and ""Make him be silent,"" it's not really count as conversation. Sorry, I ramble. It's been 7 months that I have not kissed. That's it, I start! Lack of sleep! Wait, I cry there, though?It happens to me often. I will not complain. Here, I feel bad!That's my little plug! I love you so much!
"
4,7,76,Lily:,"I will be as carbon copy Charlotte. Worse. At least, her husband works at home. Well, he deale of sh1t, but it is a caring father.
"
4,7,77,Ted:,"Marshall is a very good father.
"
4,7,78,Lily:,"Marshall is always at work, and I'm afraid to hit all the work if we have one now.
"
4,7,79,Ted:,"You panic and you see only bad side.
"
4,7,80,Robin:,"I think it's just realistic.
"
4,7,81,Lily:,"Well, that's perfect. That's why I called you. Ted, you're for children. Robin, you're against. Councillors, please proceed.
"
4,7,82,Ted:,"OK, I know you're afraid of not being ready. But we think ever be. You just take the plunge and it will come naturally.
"
4,7,83,Robin:,"Of course for you, it is natural, you're practically already a father.
"
4,7,84,Lily:,"You're a father too.
"
4,7,85,Ted:,"What are you talking?
"
4,7,86,Robin:,"Ted, thoughtful. You go out jokes father of super lame.
"
4,7,87,Ted:,"A cereal killer! A cereal killer!
"
4,7,88,Robin:,"You make us moral. Like when you broke your ship in a bottle.
"
4,7,89,Ted:,"I'm not sorry. I'm just disappointed.
"
4,7,90,Barney:,"That's it!
"
4,7,91,Robin:,"Shut up!
"
4,7,92,Robin:,"And you do that thing that all fathers are with the waitresses.
"
4,7,93,Waitress:,"My name is Lori. I'll be your waitress tonight.
"
4,7,94,Ted:,"Hello, Lori, me, this is Ted. I will be your customer tonight.Before leaving, tell me. What is a killer in a wheat field? No index.
"
4,7,95,Lily:,"She's right. Perhaps you're single and childless, but you're really a redneck dad.
"
4,7,96,Ted:,"I do not appreciate that tone, young lady.
"
4,7,97,Barney:,"The No-Fathers Day is a success! Laraby Finklestein and help me celebrate. Matt. Mugs ""Best Non-Father of the world."" There... T-shirts ""Who is your daddy? ""Available on fetedesnonperes.com. Looking greeting cards.
"
4,7,98,Marshall:,"""For everything you do for your pear, for all the tape on your desk, on the road darkens your Porsche Carrera, I wish you... a night of threesome. Happy Birthday Non-Fathers. ""
"
4,7,99,Barney:,"Look at the illustration.
"
4,7,100,Marshall:,"It looks like an Asian hooker.
"
4,7,101,Barney:,"Because at the Non-Fathers Day, you have a Thai girl you a blowjob. Tope, puns!
"
4,7,102,Lily:,"It puts you in the mash, then. Your only hope is to be negative.
"
4,7,103,Ted:,"I'll tell you why my opponent says it all. Three words: fear of... babies.
"
4,7,104,Robin:,"What? You're crazy. This is false.
"
4,7,105,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,7,106,Ted:,"And when we saw my cousin and her baby? She's so cute!
"
4,7,107,Cousin:,"You want to wear it?
"
4,7,108,Ted:,"Where the party that Lily had done for her friend Erika?You do feel for this baby?
"
4,7,109,Robin:,"I do not want to bite.
"
4,7,110,Ted:,"And do not forget...
"
4,7,111,Marshall:,"Pub with baby talk?
"
4,7,112,Ted:,"Pub with baby talk.
"
4,7,113,Ted:,"But you're not like that. You like children too.
"
4,7,114,Lily:,"Yes, I'm lovely, beautiful and brilliant, but it's enough?
"
4,7,115,Robin:,"It comes down to one word: ""you"". Are you ready to put your dreams in the background? Back in college, taught art at the university? You have to concentrate on the project before starting Lily Baby Project. Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.And it would be good neither for you nor for the baby. What is it?
"
4,7,116,Lily:,"The sock Jeremy. I will make a baby.
"
4,7,117,Robin:,"Well, and everything I said?
"
4,7,118,Lily:,"But sock.
"
4,7,119,Robin:,"And Marshall who works all the time?
"
4,7,120,Lily:,"But sock.
"
4,7,121,Robin:,"But but Lily Project!
"
4,7,122,Lily:,"With small fish.
"
4,7,123,Robin:,"We had this debate, and this is the sock that makes you make the decision?
"
4,7,124,Ted:,"I think you're taking a ""chausettogari"", eh, Robin?
"
4,7,125,Robin:,"Shut up, Dad.
"
4,7,126,Ted:,"You, shut up, baby-phobic.
"
4,7,127,Robin:,"Babies are scary, OK? With their giant eyes. And seriously, the fontanelle? If there is a self-destruct button, at least, hide it where it will not accidentally press.
"
4,7,128,Ted:,"Where is Lily? You have to drink?
"
4,7,129,Robin:,"Not a drop.
"
4,7,130,Ted:,"I do not either.
"
4,7,131,Men:,"Meeting in 5 minutes. You better be on top for Mr. Li This haunts my nightmares. Finally, have fun well, small.
"
4,7,132,Lily:,"Put a baby in me, Marshall. I'm ready.
"
4,7,133,Marshall:,"What are you doing here?
"
4,7,134,Lily:,"I'm ready. This is the big night. Removing your seed melon-headed in my belly.
"
4,7,135,Marshall:,"What?
"
4,7,136,Lily:,"Come on, come on. Make me a baby. I'm ready. Hey, look. The types of the other building make me cuckoo. Hello, gentlemen! We will make a baby!
"
4,7,137,Ted:,"I dream, it has been lost.
"
4,7,138,Robin:,"That's why I have no children. We can not even taking his eyes for a second.
"
4,7,139,Marshall:,"I can not find my file.
"
4,7,140,Lily:,"I'm all out of ""A"" to ""G"".
"
4,7,141,Robin:,"They sit there with their stupid bottles. They cry. They vomit. That's why babies, it sucks.
"
4,7,142,Ted:,"That's good that we have broken. I had totally forgotten your psychosis on the kids.
"
4,7,143,Robin:,"My psychosis? Whenever you hear the word ""kid"", you have two small Milk tasks on your shirt.
"
4,7,144,Ted:,"God thank you, you're not my mother. You're an ice queen. All you have breastfed baby by a frozen brain.
"
4,7,145,Robin:,"Do not depict me as a monster for wanting to remain independent. In there is a lot of people who do not want it.
"
4,7,146,Barney:,"My brother, lay your hand on the box tops and repeat after me. Me, the false name you give to women.
"
4,7,147,Man:,"I, Johnny Banana.
"
4,7,148,Barney:,"Swear to always choose the wet t-shirts to wet diapers.
"
4,7,149,Man:,"Swear to always...

4,7,150,Ted:,"You're in good company there.
"
4,7,151,Robin:,"I'll see if the toilet. I also want to bring you back buffer.
"
4,7,152,Ted:,"Okay. When you have finished, you could ask a magician to heart.
"
4,7,153,Robin:,"You know what? I should find another place to sleep.
"
4,7,154,Ted:,"No argument.
"
4,7,155,Robin:,"Well.
"
4,7,156,Ted:,"Super.
"
4,7,157,Barney:,"Welcome to our fraternity of non-paternity. In is one of ours.
"
4,7,158,Marshall:,"Gentlemen, Mr. Li, if you will go to page 5 of your file merge. I think...
"
4,7,159,Man:,"What has he, Eriksen?
"
4,7,160,Marshall:,"Nothing. I think you are... very beautiful today.
"
4,7,161,Man:,"What are you looking?
"
4,7,162,Marshall:,"I look at the future... of our two companies and it seems very... naked. Will you excuse me one second?
"
4,7,163,Mr. Li:,"No one saw the girl drunk?
"
4,7,164,Barney:,"Guys, you did not... This is a picture of me without children. And with macaroni glued to the frame. Guys, I love it.
"
4,7,165,Robin:,"Lily is not there.
"
4,7,166,Ted:,"Your cell phone rang. I answered. Hope it bother you. Lily is at Marshall. She is fine.
"
4,7,167,Robin:,"thank you God. What?
"
4,7,168,Ted:,"When storing your mobile, I found something in your bag.
"
4,7,169,Robin:,"I have a permit for that. And the other thing is a gift.
"
4,7,170,Ted:,"You've stolen the Ca sock Jeremy.
"
4,7,171,Robin:,"No. I do not know what she's doing there. It must have fallen into it. Bizarre!
"
4,7,172,Ted:,"""Falling in? ""
"
4,7,173,Robin:,"Or Lily put it there for fun. That bitch is stuffed. I took it.It's just... so cute. Sock.
"
4,7,174,Ted:,"Robin Scherbatsky, you get the idea of having children?
"
4,7,175,Robin:,"I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch.
"
4,7,176,Ted:,"There were two difficult months both. I have a room free.Why not come to me in the meantime?
"
4,7,177,Robin:,"Really?
"
4,7,178,Ted:,"Yeah.
"
4,7,179,Robin:,"Thank you, Ted. I have some ideas, so it will be one week, two large max.
"
4,7,180,Ted (2030):,"And this is how your aunt Robin moved in with me.
"
4,7,181,Lily:,"I'm bored. Come and dance. Come fly a liquor store!
"
4,7,182,Marshall:,"We're going nowhere. Each time we go out when you're drunk, you always fall asleep when you enter the...
"
4,7,183,Lily:,"Let's dance! We gonna party all night!
"
4,7,184,Marshall:,"Can you make several turns to make sure she is asleep?
"
4,7,185,Driver:,"Sure.
"
4,7,186,Barney:,"The last great idea for Fathers Day-No, a pregnancy test, but instead of a blue line, there is a small blue Barney who does that.
"
4,7,187,Ted:,"Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers.
"
4,7,188,Barney:,"What are you talking? This is a good group of friends.
"
4,7,189,Ted:,"This is the effect cheerleaders.
"
4,7,190,Barney:,"No, Ted. It works for girls.
"
4,7,191,Robin:,"Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend.
"
4,7,192,Ted:,"Good night, Barney.
"
4,7,193,Robin:,"Good night.
"
4,7,194,Barney:,"Sock.

4,7,195,Marshall:,"I smell pancakes with chocolate?
"
4,7,196,Lily:,"No, you feel ""pancake, I'm sorry for being such a stupid drunk"" chocolate.
"
4,7,197,Marshall:,"There's no ""I wish not to throw up on you"" bacon?
"
4,7,198,Lily:,"Of course.
"
4,7,199,Marshall:,"Baby...
"
4,7,200,Lily:,"I blame myself for last night. I was really painful. I just panicked at the thought of whether we are ready to parent. But you are so well taken care of me. I know you're gonna be a good father.
"
4,7,201,Marshall:,"I want to be a father now.
"
4,7,202,Lily:,"What?
"
4,7,203,Marshall:,"Last night, it was just... I share between work and drunk baby Lily, it was too. I just begin with this job, I work long hours... I love you. And I really want to have children one day.I just want... I want to be ready for that.
"
4,7,204,Lily:,"Me too. When we're ready, I know you'll be fantastic.
"
4,7,205,Marshall:,"You too.
"
4,7,206,Lily:,"You wanna make love, by protecting themselves now?
"
4,7,207,Marshall:,"Yes.
"
4,7,208,Lily:,"You want to finish your bacon first?
"
4,7,209,Marshall:,"You're the perfect woman.
"
4,7,210,Barney:,"""And the cat is in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon. When are you going back home, Dad? I do not know when we're together then, son I know we will have a good time. ""
"
4,13,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, during the second year of college, when Lily is back from vacation, Marshall surprised her at the airport.And she caught him with a pack of Root Beer.
"
4,13,2,Lily:,"Fort Lau-ger-Dale! Get it?
"
4,13,3,Ted (2030):,"And suddenly, a ritual was born. The next 11 years, if one of them was on a plane...
"
4,13,4,Marshall:,"Minne-Cider! Get it?
"
4,13,5,Ted (2030):,".. the reunion was still commemorated with a sign and a pack where they came from.

4,13,6,Lily:,"Aspen Yards Ale! Get it?
"
4,13,7,Marshall:,"Actually, no!
"
4,13,8,Lily:,"I do not either. I was hoping that you find.
"
4,13,9,Ted (2030):,"But, one night in January 2009, the unthinkable happened.

4,13,11,Ted:,"What?
"
4,13,12,Marshall:,"Lily not want me to take a taxi to the airport just to get a taxi in the opposite direction.
"
4,13,13,Ted:,"But the thing of the pack?
"
4,13,14,Marshall:,"It was fun when we were younger, but we exceeded it. When mature, the relationship matures with us.
"
4,13,15,Ted:,"But... you are an inspiration to us all, you are so dedicated and linked. I look at you, and that's all I want in the world.
"
4,13,16,Barney:,"There are two students out, and they look easy!

4,13,19,Ted:,"It's good. God thank you. What brings you here?
"
4,13,20,Woman 1:,"Our group did a concert.
"
4,13,21,Ted:,"You have a group? We will perhaps see you.
"
4,13,22,Barney:,"Excuse me one second. (Barney leads Ted to the bar entrance) What is your problem? We will not see them play.
"
4,13,23,Ted:,"Why?
"
4,13,24,Barney:,"If you go see them, it is not better than blondes showing their tits at a concert by Van Halen.
"
4,13,25,Ted:,"Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?
"
4,13,26,Barney:,"If you want to sleep with Van Halen, do it on your spare time. We're not guys who-could-come-you-see. It is the other guys, those older, who ever came and whose recognition is required.
"
4,13,27,Ted:,"We are their fathers?
"
4,13,28,Barney:,"Exactly. (They go see the girls) This is a great meeting, I think that we can come. Another time, girls.
"
4,13,29,Ted:,"If you want to see us afterwards, we can exchange our numbers.
"
4,13,30,Barney:,"Excuse us a minute. (Barney leads Ted still at the entrance of the bar) Have you gone crazy? We do not want their numbers.
"
4,13,31,Ted:,"I know not what I was doing. I had panic there.
"
4,13,32,Barney:,"Qua na you exchange a number, you give him the opportunity to call to cancel. If you give a number without an appointment, they must come. Checkmate! No number, just my fingers. Truck.
"
4,13,33,Ted:,"You're still their father?
"
4,13,34,Barney:,"Why not arrange to meet you here tomorrow night to 22h.
"
4,13,35,Woman 1:,"I think it will snow. What do we do if there is a blizzard?
"
4,13,36,Barney:,"Whatever happens, we will be there.
"
4,13,37,Ted:,"That's all ""ski"" account.
"
4,13,38,Barney:,"Sorry one last time.
"
4,13,39,Ted:,"What is the problem here?
"
4,13,40,Barney:,"Well done.
"
4,13,41,Ted:,"Thank you.
"
4,13,42,Barney:,"At tomorrow night.
"
4,13,43,Woman 2:,"Bluntly.
"
4,13,44,Woman 1:,"Great!
"
4,13,45,Barney:,"'Definitely. Great! ""Dude, these students seem stupid.
"
4,13,46,Ted:,"Bluntly.
"
4,13,47,Barney:,"Awesome. Here's the thing: tomorrow night, dress up well, it will move!
"
4,13,48,Ted:,"We would still have had to make their numbers.
"
4,13,49,Barney:,"You always imagine the worst. Ted, I promise, everything will be okay. It begins to snow.
"
4,13,50,Ted (2030):,"Children, the blizzard of 2009 was a monster. It snowed for 3 days, which gave three incredible stories. I start with Barney and me.
"
4,13,51,Ted:,"It's really bad outside. They will not.
"
4,13,52,Barney:,"But if it will come. It has to. If I can touch one of those girls, I get a ""Bingo party student."" Come on, Ted. You're the only one here.
"
4,13,53,Ted:,"Sorry, a ""Bingo party student""?
"
4,13,54,Barney:,"Every year, Playboy publishes a list of the best student parties in the country. I take the top 25, and I do... a bingo card. All I need now that Arizona Tech, which is crazy. In a contest, it would be given automatically.
"
4,13,55,Ted:,"How many people are on this festive bingo student?
"
4,13,56,Barney:,"Just me.
"
4,13,57,Ted:,"What is the purpose then?
"
4,13,58,Barney:,"The goal is to make it five in a row.
"
4,13,59,Ted:,"And you got what, if you succeed?
"
4,13,60,Barney:,"I have a bingo.
"
4,13,61,Robin:,"Thanks for stopping by. I hacked the thermostat for 1 h before it was seen that the intercom.
"
4,13,62,Marshall:,"Yeah, I heard you moan from below.
"
4,13,63,Robin:,"The theft of Lily's tonight, you're really not looking for it?
"
4,13,64,Marshall:,"As I said, when you grow up, our relationship matures with us.
"
4,13,65,Robin:,"Knowing your wife, she'll still bring you back a pack.
"
4,13,66,Lily:,"Marshall?
"
4,13,67,Man:,"Puget Stout. The choicest of beverages from Seattle.And speaking of pack...
"
4,13,68,Robin:,"What are you doing?
"
4,13,69,Marshall:,"I'm going to the airport. How could I be so stupid? Of course it takes me back a pack!
"
4,13,70,Lily:,"But this time, I'm not back pack. Because... when it matures, the relationship matures with us.
"
4,13,71,Woman:,"He looks like a nice young man. I bet it will surprise you and pick you up anyway.
"
4,13,72,Marshall:,"Where is my beer?
"
4,13,73,Lily:,"It was said not this time.
"
4,13,74,Marshall turns his sign which says:,"""Someone with beer.""
"
4,13,75,Woman:,"I have beer.
"
4,13,76,Marshall:,"A pack and a size that suits me. Come on, new Lily.
"
4,13,77,Lily:,"I drink beer.
"
4,13,78,Voice:,"This is your captain speaking. Apparently, it will arrive with an hour early.
"
4,13,79,Carl:,"Finish, guys. I close the bar.
"
4,13,80,Ted:,"No! It is only 21h.
"
4,13,81,Barney:,"And it rocks here, yo!
"
4,13,82,Carl:,"I'm really sorry, but I have to install beds in the church. It becomes a refuge, snowy nights.
"
4,13,83,Barney:,"selfish b*st*rd! There are two cannons girls who come to us here.
"
4,13,84,Ted:,"You can leave it open a little more? We monitor everything.
"
4,13,85,Carl:,"You two? Impossible. You ignore the low bar.
"
4,13,86,Barney:,"Serve the guns first?
"
4,13,87,Carl:,"That's the key. Once your girls arrive, you turn off the lights and close. I want to go back and find a mess here.
"
4,13,88,Ted:,"Seriously?
"
4,13,89,Carl:,"I can trust you.
"
4,13,90,Ted (2030):,"To find out what it meant to have the keys to the bar, I must revert back to the night when I released five little words that everyone says at one point in his life.
"
4,13,91,Ted:,"There should be a bar.
"
4,13,92,Barney:,"Of course, we should have a bar!
"
4,13,93,Ted:,"You really should have a bar.
"
4,13,94,Barney:,"It really should have a bar.
"
4,13,95,Ted:,"Our bar would be great.
"
4,13,96,Barney:,"And dude, dude, dude, dude... The name of our bar will be... Puzzles. People will, ""Why Puzzles? ""That's the puzzle.
"
4,13,97,Ted:,"That's... a great name for a bar! And also, Puzzles: no nightcap.
"
4,13,98,Barney:,"No nightcap!
"
4,13,99,Ted:,"Except where everyone ended up spending the best night of his life, then we put the chairs on the tables and pulled out the margarita fountain.
"
4,13,100,Barney:,"There should be a bar.
"
4,13,101,Ted:,"There should be a bar.
"
4,13,102,Ted (2030):,"Like all stupid sentences of five words that every man in her life said...
"
4,13,103,Marshall:,"I can jump as far.
"
4,13,104,Ted:,"I'm going to recover.
"
4,13,105,Carl:,"I can trust you.
"
4,13,106,Ted (2030):,".. we would regret it. We knew not yet.
"
4,13,107,Lily:,"You? Great! I'm coming. (She hangs up his phone) Ranjit?
"
4,13,108,Woman:,"I'm Rachel Sondheimer.
"
4,13,109,Ranjit:,"One moment, Lily. IF you get off the plane, which is Marshall? And the pack of beer?
"
4,13,110,Lily:,"That's the problem. I must be Brunivers in East Meadow in one hour.
"
4,13,111,Ranjit:,"In the car!
"
4,13,112,Lily:,"Thank you.
"
4,13,113,Ted:,"Barman. Triple Sec.
"
4,13,114,Barney:,"It happens, keep tap. We will buy one.
"
4,13,115,Ted:,"Served.
"
4,13,116,Barney:,"Served.
"
4,13,117,Ted:,"We will buy one.
"
4,13,118,Woman 1:,"thank you God, you're still here.
"
4,13,119,Woman 2:,"I do not know if you've seen Star Wars, but it looks like Hoth out.
"
4,13,120,Ted:,"Prem's.
"
4,13,121,Woman 1:,"Reminds me of when I was sledding with my father... before he leaves.
"
4,13,122,Barney:,"And prem's.
"
4,13,123,Ted:,"It can get warm with a glass?
"
4,13,124,Woman 2:,"Sure... In fact, I invited the rest of the group to join us.
"
4,13,125,Woman 1:,"It is the intention of getting drunk. Really get drunk.As my father did.
"
4,13,126,Barney:,"Prem's, prem's prem's.
"
4,13,127,Ted:,"I guess you could stay open longer. As it is you and the group? (The bar is crowded) Melissa, what kind of group is it?
"
4,13,128,Melissa:,"We are the band of hens fighting Arizona Tech.
"
4,13,129,All:,"Come on, Chickens!
"
4,13,130,Ted (2030):,"It was then that Uncle Barney and I had a telepathic conversation.
"
4,13,131,Ted:,"Dude, Carl is going to kill us if we turn not everyone immediately. I'm serious. He promised not to mess. Okay, you score a point. The bar is open! Who wants a beer?
"
4,13,132,Robin:,"I always find it silly. What happened to ""when you grow up, the relationship matures with us""?
"
4,13,133,Marshall:,"It's just something Lily read in ""Psychology."" It's good, she read in ""Cosmo"". Okay, I read in ""Cosmo"". Well, it was in ""Cosmo Girl"". Drive, OK?
"
4,13,134,Robin:,"Why make a fuss a little ritual is abandoned.
"
4,13,135,Marshall:,"It's more than that, OK? This is our little rituals. You know what we did when I got home?
"
4,13,136,Robin:,"I do not wanna hear about f*ck like rabbits.
"
4,13,137,Marshall:,"They told what they had eaten at noon.
"
4,13,138,Marshall:,"Two eggs, a cheese pizza and steamed vegetables.
"
4,13,139,Lily:,"A little bread, chicken, celery sticks and a spoon of peanut butter. We f*ck like rabbits?
"
4,13,140,Marshall:,"They f*ck like rabbits.
"
4,13,141,Ranjit:,"BTI... Too much information.
"
4,13,142,Lily:,"You know what I miss? The call for lunch.
"
4,13,143,Lily:,"Baby, it's lunch and I love you.
"
4,13,144,Marshall at the office:,"I do not think less. Although I must warn you that there seems to be a surplus on my side.
"
4,13,145,Lily:,"No, I love you even more.
"
4,13,146,Marshall:,"Do we get a room to pull all this out? It seemed like a good compromise, although I have to work my positions. I love you too.
"
4,13,147,Marshall:,"Now, when she calls, I let the answering machine.The answering machine!
"
4,13,148,Robin:,"How dare you?
"
4,13,149,Marshall:,"What I miss most is the kiss of midnight New Year
"
4,13,150,Lily:,"It was New Year's tradition But you know what we did this year?
"
4,13,151,Ranjit:,"Kiss like rabbits?
"
4,13,152,Lily:,"No.
"
4,13,153,Robin:,"All of these little rituals, nice, cute... This is stupid. Say what we ate? They look like kids playing in the dinette.
"
4,13,154,Marshall:,"Maybe you think it's stupid because you've never had a relationship that lasts long enough for that.
"
4,13,155,Robin:,"What?
"
4,13,156,Marshall:,"You know nothing of love. You're like a robot that someone would cry and say that... ""Why this human leaking?""
"
4,13,157,Robin:,"Really? Okay... Robot mode station-you-on-the-aisle-in-waiting-for-excuse-of-the imbecile.
"
4,13,158,Marshall:,"My robot was... a thousand times better.
"
4,13,159,Man:,"FYI, the sink overflows into the bathroom.
"
4,13,160,Ted:,"There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen.
"
4,13,161,Barney:,"Is there anything in a gin and tonic? There's what in a gin and tonic?
"
4,13,162,Ted:,"Hold a bar, it sucks. Is closed.
"
4,13,163,Barney:,"No nightcap! (The phone rings) Puzzles, Barney here.
"
4,13,164,Carl:,"Well, you're still there. I arrive in 5 minutes.
"
4,13,165,Barney:,"Last glass.
"
4,13,166,Marshall:,"A snowplow arrives. We must leave.
"
4,13,167,Robin:,"You think being in love, it's just to have pet names. Or let the words stupid or darken in the blizzard for no reason.
"
4,13,168,Marshall:,"You know what will happen?
"
4,13,169,Robin:,"You know what you are? You're a snob of love. There's lots of ways to live a relationship, you would know if you left your little club ""Snob love.""
"
4,13,170,Marshall:,"We'll be buried under the snow, that's what will happen.
"
4,13,171,Robin:,"Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go. (The snowplow passes and buried under the snow) It's been what?
"
4,13,172,Lily:,"It was earlier called for the drink of Seattle.
"
4,13,173,Man:,"You did well to call. I was close. It's the perfect storm outside. It was only in 2009, when the storm of the century, it is perhaps a little premature. Let the storm of the year. Even if one is in January.
"
4,13,174,Lily:,"It is rather a hurry, so we'll take the beer.
"
4,13,175,Man:,"You are a cute couple.
"
4,13,176,Ranjit:,"Thank you.
"
4,13,177,Lily:,"We're not a couple.
"
4,13,178,Man:,"God thank you. It would have been weird. Here it is.""Supersonic Tonic"".
"
4,13,179,Lily:,"No. It is a drum. I want a six pack.
"
4,13,180,Man:,"That's all I have.
"
4,13,181,Lily:,"You take the barrel.
"
4,13,182,Ranjit:,"What? No. The last time I had one in the car, I ended up removing the dried vomit on the seat with a knife.
"
4,13,183,Lily:,"Sorry, Ranjit, but it is a ritual, and I back this beer. If you could put it in the car. I'll give you $ 50.
"
4,13,184,Ranjit:,"A car.
"
4,13,185,Marshall:,"Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules.
"
4,13,186,Robin:,"Close your eyes.
"
4,13,187,Marshall:,"I know not how you thought I draguais you, but...
"
4,13,188,Robin:,"Do it. (Robin opened the roof and the snow falls on them) Now, go find your wife.
"
4,13,189,Barney:,"Okay, go. You are not obliged to return, but you can not stay. I always wanted to say that. I mean, in a bar. I say all the time with me.
"
4,13,190,Man:,"One day, we should have a bar. And when it will, there will never be nightcap.
"
4,13,191,Ted:,"We said no last drink. We must do.
"
4,13,192,Barney:,"We should do what? Carl will be there from one moment to another.
"
4,13,193,Ted:,"We can do one thing.
"
4,13,194,Ted:,"Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know.
"
4,13,195,Barney:,"We should start a band.
"
4,13,196,Ted:,"Of course! Why was not yet formed a band?
"
4,13,197,Ted (2030):,"Children, sometimes in life, the planets align, everything comes together, and your timing is perfect.(Marshall and Lily calls Marshall called Lily but neither Marshall or Lily of the horizon. Lily sits on a bench and Marshall as well) It was not one of those moments.
"
4,13,198,Marshall:,"Where is she?
"
4,13,199,Robin:,"Seattle.
"
4,13,200,Marshall:,"What?
"
4,13,201,Robin:,"His flight was canceled. He has never taken off.
"
4,13,202,Marshall:,"She would have called me and...
"
4,13,203,Lily:,"Baby, it's me. My flight was canceled because of a snowstorm and I will not fly until Thursday, I'm still stuck here for two days. It's lunchtime and I love you.
"
4,13,204,Ted (2030):,"As I said, it was a storm of three days. Tuesday...
"
4,13,205,Robin:,"I still think it's stupid.
"
4,13,206,Ted (2030):,"Wednesday... (Barney and Ted are at McClaren's, behind the counter) And Thursday... (Lily is a store with Ranjit) So Tuesday, when Marshall heard this message...
"
4,13,207,Marshall:,"It not return until Thursday. It was all the way here and not return until Thursday. I feel stupid. Listen, they say nothing to Lily about everything, OK? Especially the part where thou dredges.
"
4,13,208,Robin:,"I've not dredged.
"
4,13,209,Marshall:,"That's it.
"
4,13,210,Ted (2030):,"Then Wednesday...
"
4,13,211,Ted:,"Dude, I do not believe that you've ever done this far.You'll have to go back and redo all that way again tomorrow.
"
4,13,212,Marshall:,"The whole thing was a sign. Let us end this ancient ritual. I will not get it.
"
4,13,213,Ted:,"Robin you really dredged?
"
4,13,214,Marshall:,"Dude, that was weird.
"
4,13,215,Man:,"Guys, this festival is great! You are true friends of Hens fighting. If necessary, do not hesitate to ask.
"
4,13,216,Barney:,"The flute section does she see anyone?
"
4,13,217,Ted:,"You're not really looking for it?
"
4,13,218,Marshall:,"Really.
"
4,13,219,Ted:,"So, on New Year's kiss, calls for lunch, all... ""I ate it today,"" you're really going to drop it?
"
4,13,220,Marshall:,"Yes, really.
"
4,13,221,Ted (2030):,"Which brings us to Thursday.
"
4,13,222,Marshall:,"A muffin, a pastrami sandwich, and chips. I know that lunch is over, but I love you. I love you Lily, more and more each day. Happy New Year. That means I have to bring a band at the airport now?
"
4,13,223,Lily:,"Yes.
"
4,13,224,Marshall:,"Damn.
"
4,13,225,Ted:,"Puzzles.
"
4,13,226,Woman:,"This is a great band name. Have you seen Amanda?
"
4,13,227,Barney:,"Bingo!
"
4,12,1,Ted (2030):,"Children in the winter of 2009, Robin and I became roommates. And to be honest it was not really the top.
"
4,12,2,Ted:,"It looks good. I'll do.
"
4,12,3,Robin:,"There's no more milk.
"
4,12,4,Ted:,"I saw in the fridge.
"
4,12,5,Robin:,"empty.
"
4,12,6,Ted:,"So, throw it.
"
4,12,7,Robin:,"The trash can is full.
"
4,12,8,Ted:,"So, take out the trash.
"
4,12,9,Robin:,"I eat cereal.
"
4,12,10,Ted:,"You know, when I asked you to be my roommate, I said, ""A girl, she will be careful."" But no, you're an ogre Revenge of the Nerds.
"
4,12,11,Robin:,"You know what? Instead of coming with references typical last minute like that, you should spend some time, I dunno... washing a dish.
"
4,12,12,Ted:,"Damn, I can not. I'm busy leave a plate of cookies for the elf magic puts toilet paper. Wait, there's no elf. It's always me!
"
4,12,13,Robin:,"I always changing. You, never!
"
4,12,14,Ted:,"This is ridiculous!
"
4,12,15,Robin:,"No, I went there yesterday... Stop it! Stop it! My God, what happens? When we were a couple, we lived together and we almost went insane.
"
4,12,16,Ted:,"I know. It's been what?
"
4,12,17,Robin:,"You know what this is? We made love. Men and women need s*x to live together. It resolves all disputes.
"
4,12,18,Ted:,"As Barney's theory on world peace?
"
4,12,19,Barney:,"I explained. I said, Madeline, every international conflict essentially boils down to sexual tension.
"
4,12,20,Ted:,"All international conflicts?
"
4,12,21,Barney:,"All, man.
"
4,12,22,Ted:,"So, the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...
"
4,12,23,Barney:,"Gaza Strippers. Next.
"
4,12,24,Ted:,"Apartheid?
"
4,12,25,Barney:,"""Apartouze"". You have what?
"
4,12,26,Ted:,"The Cold War?
"
4,12,27,Barney:,"""Mrs. Gorbachev, removed her underwear.""
"
4,12,28,Ted:,"Well, I think we should love again.
"
4,12,29,Robin:,"Yes, of course.
"
4,12,30,Robin:,"I know. It's like riding a bike, man?
"
4,12,31,Ted:,"Biking upside down. Well, listen. If it should happen on occasion, they say nothing to anyone. Sold.
"
4,12,32,Robin:,"Sold.
"
4,12,33,Marshall:,"Sold.
"
4,12,34,Marshall:,"You do not care what, guys? You are back together?
"
4,12,35,Ted:,"No. It was just love to do more fighting.
"
4,12,36,Marshall:,"It's a great idea. No, really. Hat guys. I saw in the future and everything works perfectly for everyone.
"
4,12,37,Robin:,"Why are you here anyway?
"
4,12,38,Marshall:,"I was working and I had to take a leap here...reading this magazine. In... the room there.
"
4,12,39,Ted:,"I understand. No problem.
"
4,12,40,Robin:,"If this is a problem. You've done all the way here to read a magazine? I am willing to bet that there is a place to read this magazine at work. You know, a room with a little man on the door?
"
4,12,41,Marshall:,"Well, Robin. Nobody likes reading a magazine at work. You leave your office holding a magazine...
"
4,12,42,Marshall:,".. and the magazine says one thing and no one.
"
4,12,43,Magazine:,"Hey everybody, look at what Marshall will do!Marshall will read an old magazine in the bathroom that you all share with him.
"
4,12,44,Robin:,"Have you thought about maybe not reading a magazine when you read a magazine?
"
4,12,45,Marshall:,"You have to read a magazine. That's why there has magazines.
"
4,12,46,Ted:,"So, this is wasted time.
"
4,12,47,Marshall:,"Exactly. And the worst part is, this piece of my hallway door to the toilet. It's exposure to criticism.
"
4,12,48,Marshall:,"It was my head.
"
4,12,49,Leader:,"We know exactly what you will do.
"
4,12,50,Marshall:,"The boss.
"
4,12,51,Bilson:,"Eriksen, why you do not move your office there?
"
4,12,52,Man:,"Donald ""I think he has a Woman."" My darling, if flagrant.
"
4,12,53,Marshall:,"Anyway, I'd rather do it here.
"
4,12,54,Robin:,"No, I'm sorry. This is our house now. Marshall, you should also read a magazine. Give me your key.
"
4,12,55,Marshall:,"No, certainly not. Reminds me of a bargain between three parties where no one would discuss a certain event happened. An event... persuasion. This key, madam, this is my silence. Good day to you both.
"
4,12,56,Lily:,"You slept together?
"
4,12,57,Marshall:,"Thank you, Lily.
"
4,12,58,Barney:,"You... have slept together. What are √©pouv...stouflant. Epouvstouflant. Well done, Ted. Bravo.
"
4,12,59,Robin:,"It seems more important than it is.
"
4,12,60,Ted:,"We talked and we realized we had some difficult months.It deserves a little fun.
"
4,12,61,Lily:,"No. It could ruin your friendship. When two former try the ""right opportunity"", someone always ends in pain.
"
4,12,62,Ted (2030):,"In fact, Lily was right. We talk about it later.
"
4,12,63,Robin:,"We will not get there, OK? Nobody will get hurt. It has established rules.
"
4,12,64,Ted:,"Rule number one: purely physical relationship. There are no feelings.
"
4,12,65,Robin:,"This is like telling Fonzie be cool.
"
4,12,66,Ted:,"And since it's just physical, it was not to worry love.
"
4,12,67,Robin:,"You can do it watching TV!
"
4,12,68,Ted:,"Absolutely! Let's multitasking. Use s*x to spice up the boring activities.
"
4,12,69,Robin:,"As folding laundry.
"
4,12,70,Ted:,"Paying the bills.
"
4,12,71,Ted:,"It's not very hygienic.
"
4,12,72,Robin:,"Yes, not that one.
"
4,12,73,Robin:,"And now they sleep together, we argue more.
"
4,12,74,Ted:,"Problem solved. In fact, the credit goes to Barney. This idea just your thing on the world peace.
"
4,12,75,Robin:,"Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once.
"
4,12,76,Barney:,"So, I am responsible for... Excellent. Excellent.Excellent. The next tour is for me!
"
4,12,77,Lily:,"Are you okay?
"
4,12,78,Barney:,"Yes. Why you ask?
"
4,12,79,Lily:,"For one thing, you cry openly.
"
4,12,80,Barney:,"From joy. I am so happy for them.
"
4,12,81,Lily:,"Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you.
"
4,12,82,Barney:,"I'm going quite well. Excuse me just a minute. (He goes out into the alley behind the bar, takes a television in a trash can and throws it down. Then back to talk to Lily) I'm going quite well.
"
4,12,83,Lily:,"You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist.
"
4,12,84,Barney:,"Wait. If I pay a woman $ 200 an hour to feel better, it will not discuss. And there will be both on the couch. The woman in my scenario, she is a prostitute. Dirty, vulgar, all redone, from Eastern Europe...
"
4,12,85,Lily:,"I entered.
"
4,12,86,Ted:,"There's something liberating not to take it seriously.
"
4,12,87,Robin:,"Last night we did when I answered the phone.
"
4,12,88,Marshall:,"I knew you had not of paddler!
"
4,12,89,Barney:,"Wonderful, we still speak of that!
"
4,12,90,Robin:,"Look, it's a private thing between me and Ted.
"
4,12,91,Robin:,"It is not even discuss it if Marshall could read a magazine at work.
"
4,12,92,Lily:,"It was always like that. You remember, in law?
"
4,12,93,Marshall:,"Sure.
"
4,12,94,Marshall:,"Baby? What has he?
"
4,12,95,Lily:,"The bank statement arrived today. You have booked a hotel two blocks from your school, a Tuesday.
"
4,12,96,Marshall:,"That's not what you think.
"
4,12,97,Lily:,"It's that, Marshall? What's her name?
"
4,12,98,Marshall:,"Burrito. Carnitas Burrito.
"
4,12,99,Robin:,"Have you booked a hotel room just to read a magazine?
"
4,12,100,Marshall:,"You do not want me to see if the waitress at a huge scale for this haughty tone with you? Nobody likes reading a magazine at work and they say they are not human.
"
4,12,101,Barney:,"Dude, I read a magazine at work every day. I will not say how many meetings where I was late because I 'was reading a magazine. "" But I'm not ashamed of that. This is my moment. Sure, ""magazine is read"" is not sexy, but you know, this is something I have to do. Why be ashamed? Wait, ""read a magazine"" that's wank, right?
"
4,12,102,Ted:,"I think so. You still have drank all my milk!
"
4,12,103,Robin:,"We can make love.
"
4,12,104,Ted:,"OK.
"
4,12,105,Ted:,"This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing.
"
4,12,106,Barney:,"Super.
"
4,12,107,Ted:,"This morning, she cried through the door, ""You're too long in the shower! "". A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time.
"
4,12,108,Barney:,"If great.
"
4,12,109,Ted:,"Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!
"
4,12,110,Barney:,"It's... just... if... Excuse me one second.
"
4,12,111,Barney:,"So, plasmas are better in low light, but the LCD is best to play?
"
4,12,112,Seller:,"Okay, but CRTs have the deepest blacks.
"
4,12,113,Barney:,"So if I want a very good contrast ratio...
"
4,12,114,Seller:,"The deep structure of the CRT pixel resolution produces unrivaled in LCD.
"
4,12,115,Barney:,"I take the CRT.
"
4,12,116,Lily:,"Barney, it's crazy.
"
4,12,117,Barney:,"I'm fine, thank you.
"
4,12,118,Lily:,"No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. ""The time for emotions"", every Tuesday morning.
"
4,12,119,Barney:,"Look, maybe your kids resent their friends sleep together, but not me. I have never been better.
"
4,12,120,Ted (2030):,"Meanwhile, Marshall always drooled at work.
"
4,12,121,Magazine:,"Listen all, big breakfast this morning. You know what that means.
"
4,12,122,Ted (2030):,"Then came the best news he had heard long ago.
"
4,12,123,Woman:,"Are you aware? They fired everyone in the eighth.
"
4,12,124,Man:,"I know. This is a ghost town there.
"
4,12,125,Ted:,"Hello.
"
4,12,126,Robin:,"Hello.
"
4,12,127,Ted:,"It was fun last night.
"
4,12,128,Robin:,"Sure, it was a good one. Personal memo: leave it lying around the pizza box more often.
"
4,12,129,Ted:,"Okay, see you later.
"
4,12,130,Ted:,"Last night, Robin left a pizza box lying on the floor, so we had s*x three times.
"
4,12,131,Marshall:,"OK.
"
4,12,132,Ted:,"And this morning before leaving for work... we kissed.
"
4,12,133,Marshall:,"Bizarre. It's weird.
"
4,12,134,Ted:,"What? This kiss has violated the spirit of our arrangement. She probably thinks that I have feelings for her.
"
4,12,135,Marshall:,"Do you have any?
"
4,12,136,Barney:,"Yes, I love it. That's what... It's you, man.
"
4,12,137,Ted:,"No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.
"
4,12,138,Barney:,"Clearly. This is the end.
"
4,12,139,Marshall:,"Wait. Maybe she has not found it weird.
"
4,12,140,Robin:,"It was weird. Bizarre, weird, weird. B-I-R-A-Z-R-E.Bizarre.
"
4,12,141,Lily:,"That's not how it is written.
"
4,12,142,Robin:,"Come on, Lily. Do not your Ted.
"
4,12,143,Lily:,"I warned you. When ex relapse, ultimately, it hurts someone. But nobody is listening. This is the story of my life.My nice face that prevents people listen to my message.
"
4,12,144,Robin:,"What do I do?
"
4,12,145,Barney:,"A single solution. You must stop sleeping together, please.
"
4,12,146,Robin:,"I think we should stop sleeping. Ted and I, it's like cigarettes. You take one into thinking it is good. And very quickly, you buy one carton per week. I must stop it.
"
4,12,147,Ted:,"I have to stop it.
"
4,12,148,Robin:,"So, you stop that, huh?
"
4,12,149,Ted:,"I think so.
"
4,12,150,Robin:,"This is for the best. It was fun, but I do not want it becoming weird.
"
4,12,151,Ted:,"I do not either.
"
4,12,152,Robin:,"Colocs?
"
4,12,153,Ted:,"Colocs.
"
4,12,154,Ted:,"But they say nothing to anyone. Okay?
"
4,12,155,Robin:,"Sold.
"
4,12,156,Marshall:,"Sold.
"
4,12,157,Robin:,"Dude!
"
4,12,158,Ted:,"Seriously!
"
4,12,159,Lily:,"What is your problem?
"
4,12,160,Barney (the appliance store):,"This one.
"
4,12,161,Ted:,"It did not last long.
"
4,12,162,Robin:,"Actually, what you did not care for us? I thought you had the perfect plan.
"
4,12,163,Marshall:,"That was the case.
"
4,12,164,Marshall:,"Everything was going well. I felt more and more comfortable, more confident. I could conquer the world. One morning I'm in the eighth with a magazine.
"
4,12,165,Man 1:,"We will demolish everything. I want that you will destroy these walls, here... and there.
"
4,12,166,Male 2:,"It works.
"
4,12,167,Marshall:,"The celebrities extend their clothes? I also extend my machine. (The man breaks the wall of the toilet where Marshall is located) Do not enter!
"
4,12,168,Marshall:,"It did not last long.
"
4,12,169,Barney:,"Thank you.
"
4,12,170,Ted:,"What are you doing?
"
4,12,171,Barney:,"Because of your bickering roommates are always a source of conflict between you two, I wanted to help. In fact, I went to the post. I took you stamps. In about 10 000. That should be enough.
"
4,12,172,Ted:,"Thanks, I guess. You want a beer?
"
4,12,173,Barney:,"I took it in passing. It's nothing.
"
4,12,174,Ted:,"You have bought us a dishwasher?
"
4,12,175,Barney:,"It has always been there. You've been here how long?
"
4,12,176,Ted:,"So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?
"
4,12,177,Barney:,"Exactly. I worry about you.
"
4,12,178,Ted:,"It bothers you that we sleep together, right?
"
4,12,179,Barney:,"Not at all. It's crazy. What?
"
4,12,180,Ted:,"You're in love with Robin? You're in love with Robin.That's why you not want people sleeping together.
"
4,12,181,Barney:,"What? You say anything. A friend can not clean the apartment of another friend like friends do?
"
4,12,182,Ted:,"Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.
"
4,12,183,Barney:,"I give you two: Clean and gentlemen Solcarlus.
"
4,12,184,Ted:,"That thing between me and Robin is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?
"
4,12,185,Barney:,"No. This is not true, no. This is not true, no. No. Robin is all yours, man. Exploding yourself with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sleep with other girls.
"
4,12,186,Ted:,"Are you sure?
"
4,12,187,Barney:,"Yes!
"
4,12,188,Ted:,"Positive?
"
4,12,189,Barney:,"Absolutely. (Barney out of the apartment)
"
4,12,190,Barney:,"And I went with a bang. Why did I do that? It comes perhaps my father issues, but... basically, I allowed my best friend to sleep with the girl of my dreams. I completely sabotaged. And now, I smoke. I smoke.
"
4,12,191,Lily:,"Get out of here.
"
4,12,192,Barney:,"But it's time and emotions I Emotive, bears sharing.Whoever Emotive, Bear's shares, can sit on the chair of the division.
"
4,12,193,Lily:,"Barney, you're not at your therapist. These children also have their problems, you know. Ben's parents divorced.
"
4,12,194,Ben:,"Really?
"
4,12,195,Lily:,"Who wants to do the coloring?
"
4,12,196,Barney:,"Great, it's Lily who sent you? I have not the bear, OK?I will make it! Why are you smiling?
"
4,12,197,Marshall:,"I just... reading a magazine. Here at work.
"
4,12,198,Barney:,"What?
"
4,12,199,Marshall:,"It's the funniest thing. I was on the net, looking at hotels when I realized something.
"
4,12,200,Marshall:,"This is stupid.
"
4,12,201,Marshall:,"I decided it was time to face my complex and do what I had to do and once that decision, everything changed.
"
4,12,202,Woman:,"That's a young man at ease in his sneakers.
"
4,12,203,Man:,"I know what you are about to do and I respect you for that.
"
4,12,204,Bilson:,"Well the road.
"
4,12,205,Magazine:,"You have taken a big step today. Remember Shakespeare: ""Virtue is fearless and goodness, without fear.""
"
4,12,206,Marshall:,"You're right, Super Babe Are My Woman Stop telling me Why You Are Not Famous But I stop To forget. Let's do it.
"
4,12,207,Magazine:,"Watch the road.
"
4,12,208,Barney:,"Congratulations.
"
4,12,209,Marshall:,"Thank you. I would have done well at some point.Sometimes you have to... You have to say and... go there.
"
4,12,210,Barney:,"Marshall, I gotta go. In fact, there are toilets here, if you want to use.
"
4,12,211,Marshall:,".. Species
"
4,12,212,Barney:,"Ted, I must tell you the truth. I love... (Robin out the trash) tacos. What are you doing?
"
4,12,213,Robin:,"I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way.
"
4,12,214,Barney:,"Really? That's Wife... vantable.
"
4,12,215,Robin:,"Epousvantable?
"
4,12,216,Barney:,"Yes, it is √©pousvantable. What has happened?
"
4,12,217,Robin:,"He insisted. He said ""no longer able to do"" if ""it hurt someone."" I think we all know who he is talking about.
"
4,12,218,Barney:,"Oh?
"
4,12,219,Robin:,"It's not obvious?
"
4,12,220,Barney:,"It is?
"
4,12,221,Robin:,"Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of...
"
4,12,222,Barney:,"I love you.
"
4,12,223,Robin:,"Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco?
"
4,12,224,Barney:,"A Taco?
"
4,12,225,Robin:,"You love them, right?
"
4,12,226,Barney:,"Just.
"
4,12,227,Robin:,"Come on, I'm hungry.
"
4,12,228,Ted (2030):,"So Robin and I have again become roommates and everything is back to normal. Your Aunt Lily was right.When two former try the ""right opportunity"", someone is always hurt. It was just not one of us.
"
4,6,1,Ted (2030):,"Children, on your wedding day should be the happiest of your life, the culmination of a perfect love story. My marriage, at least the first has not gone so well.
"
4,6,2,Ted:,"It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.
"
4,6,3,Lily:,"Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours.
"
4,6,4,Ted:,"I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!
"
4,6,5,Barney:,"I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!
"
4,6,6,Marshall:,"How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.
"
4,6,7,Barney:,"Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others.
"
4,6,8,Lily:,"No, it is a mess.
"
4,6,9,Ted:,"It gauze?
"
4,6,10,Lily:,"A mess. And one must be there for him.
"
4,6,11,Ted (2030):,"But all my friends wanted to be there for me, I would, seemingly, well.
"
4,6,12,Lily:,"Hey, man.
"
4,6,13,Robin:,"You wanna hang out?
"
4,6,14,Ted:,"Girls, I'm fine.
"
4,6,15,Marshall:,"Dude, you make some?
"
4,6,16,Ted:,"I'm fine.
"
4,6,17,Barney:,"Hey, kid.
"
4,6,18,Ted:,"Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.
"
4,6,19,Barney:,"I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell.
"
4,6,20,Ted (2030):,"Finally, after two weeks, emotions eventually overflow.
"
4,6,21,Ted:,"What do you want for dinner?
"
4,6,22,Lily:,"Oh, the farm. I'm sorry, is that you have experienced something traumatic, and we try to be there for you, but do not you leave us, and it irritates us, selfish little whore. Sorry.
"
4,6,23,Marshall:,"We are concerned that you faced not what happened with Stella. Do you remember when Lily left me? How I buried my emotions?
"
4,6,24,Marshall:,"It... I... miss him so much.
"
4,6,25,Robin:,"Yeah man, you've been a rock.
"
4,6,26,Marshall:,"I should have been worse, OK? I should have my nerves, follow your advice and burn cases Lily.
"
4,6,27,Lily:,"Super. Thank you, Ted.
"
4,6,28,Marshall:,"I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now!
"
4,6,29,Ted:,"It's OK.
"
4,6,30,Barney:,"Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?
"
4,6,31,Ted:,"It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.
"
4,6,32,Robin:,"Why?
"
4,6,33,Ted:,"It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going.
"
4,6,34,Robin:,"Ok, how about Hurley's?
"
4,6,35,Ted:,"Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.
"
4,6,36,Lily:,"Well, The Meatloaf Charlie?
"
4,6,37,Ted:,"Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.
"
4,6,38,Barney:,"Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?
"
4,6,39,Ted:,"Of course. Look at this.
"
4,6,40,Robin:,"It's that thing?
"
4,6,41,Ted:,"A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea
"
4,6,42,Lily:,"This is ridiculous.
"
4,6,43,Robin:,"The sea is blue.
"
4,6,44,Lily:,"You can not live like this.
"
4,6,45,Marshall:,"It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding?
"
4,6,46,Ted:,"Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.
"
4,6,47,Marshall:,"It's that ""one"" small dicks?
"
4,6,48,Ted:,"No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?
"
4,6,49,Lily:,"Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone.
"
4,6,50,Ted:,"Super. Let's go.
"
4,6,51,Waiter:,"Have you decided?
"
4,6,52,Ted:,"Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?
"
4,6,53,Waiter:,"Certainly.
"
4,6,54,Ted:,"Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about?
"
4,6,55,Lily:,"I actually remember it. Oh Oh!
"
4,6,56,Robin:,"What?
"
4,6,57,Lily:,"I remember.
"
4,6,58,Ted:,"Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me.
"
4,6,59,Marshall:,"Oh, you laugh.
"
4,6,60,Lily:,"He is serious?
"
4,6,61,Barney:,"I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one.
"
4,6,62,Robin:,"She turns around.
"
4,6,63,Ted:,"Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look.
"
4,6,64,Server:,"Do you want covered?
"
4,6,65,Stella:,"No, I'm going home.
"
4,6,66,Marshall:,"She took to win.
"
4,6,67,Ted:,"She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?
"
4,6,68,Barney:,"Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella.
"
4,6,69,Marshall:,"Will the yelling.
"
4,6,70,Lily:,"You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side!
"
4,6,71,Ted:,"Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.
"
4,6,72,Lily:,"I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table.
"
4,6,73,Ted:,"Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?
"
4,6,74,Lily:,"How dare you pronounce this name to me?
"
4,6,75,Robin:,"Who is Gazeur?
"
4,6,76,Lily:,"This is the last person I would like to see here. Michael purifier. This is a guy I was in high school.
"
4,6,77,Lily:,"Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day...
"
4,6,78,Barney:,"Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty.
"
4,6,79,Robin:,"You did what?
"
4,6,80,Lily:,"Are you kidding? It was the third. I had a choice.
"
4,6,81,Lily:,"Oh, my God, purifier! It gauze?
"
4,6,82,Purifier:,"It was not me. That was it.
"
4,6,83,Lily:,"Of course purifier. Or rather Gazeur. Gazeur!
"
4,6,84,Purifier:,"I'm in the team baseball. I'm cool.
"
4,6,85,Lily:,"The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools.
"
4,6,86,Barney:,"The kids are great.
"
4,6,87,Lily:,"It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us.
"
4,6,88,Robin:,"Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome.
"
4,6,89,Server:,"It's going guys?
"
4,6,90,Ted:,"Let's just eat here, if possible.
"
4,6,91,Server:,"This is your almonds.
"
4,6,92,Ted:,"Thank you. You have a daily special?
"
4,6,93,Marshall:,"Ted, this is ridiculous.
"
4,6,94,Barney:,"I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of ""girls that I skipped""... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time.
"
4,6,95,Ted:,"Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?
"
4,6,96,Barney:,"Son of a bitch.
"
4,6,97,Host:,"Who is Becca Delucci?
"
4,6,98,Barney:,"Do you mind?
"
4,6,99,Robin:,"Who is Becca Delucci?
"
4,6,100,Barney:,"Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time.
"
4,6,101,Ted:,"Where exactly in the north, Barney?
"
4,6,102,Barney:,"Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.
"
4,6,103,Barney:,"And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.
"
4,6,104,Lily:,"That's not true?
"
4,6,105,Barney:,"Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up.
"
4,6,106,Barney:,"I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?
"
4,6,107,Woman:,"You're the only thing that kept me here.
"
4,6,108,Barney:,"That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger. (He hangs up with the first woman prisoner and will talk to another who has just arrived) Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output.
"
4,6,109,Woman:,"Hell, no!
"
4,6,110,Barney:,"Now I have letters from Becca who say, ""I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. ""Women, eh?
"
4,6,111,Ted:,"You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur. (Marshall head out from under the table) are still under the table.
"
4,6,112,Marshall:,"We do not need. Stella is a party.
"
4,6,113,Ted:,"Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace...
"
4,6,114,Marshall:,"It comes back. (They go back under the table) We all think that you need... Wait, where is Barney? (Barney is in the next table) We think you should talk to him.
"
4,6,115,Robin:,"Not me.
"
4,6,116,Marshall:,"What?
"
4,6,117,Robin:,"If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.
"
4,6,118,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,6,119,Lily:,"Who is it?
"
4,6,120,Robin:,"My father.
"
4,6,121,Barney:,"Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking?
"
4,6,122,Lily:,"From Robin's father.
"
4,6,123,Robin:,"I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now.
"
4,6,124,Lily:,"Why?
"
4,6,125,Robin:,"It goes back to my birth.
"
4,6,126,Man:,"Come on, give me my son. Grows.
"
4,6,127,Robin:,"He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.
"
4,6,128,Ted:,"How so?
"
4,6,129,Robin:,"My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse.
"
4,6,130,Robin:,"At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to shoot a deer.
"
4,6,131,Father of Robin:,"Trivia, RJ Shoot a deer is the most noble goals.
"
4,6,132,Robin:,"But they're cute.
"
4,6,133,Father:,"You said the same about our rabbits. You remember how they were delicious?
"
4,6,134,Robin:,"My body started to change...
"
4,6,135,Barney:,"Wait a second. Sorry, continues.
"
4,6,136,Robin:,"It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.
"
4,6,137,Robin:,"The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the ""Squamish Invitational."" And everybody came to my house to celebrate.
"
4,6,138,Father:,"Guys, you have behaved splendidly there on the ice.Splendidly. You go outside. I come back with soft drinks and pretzels.
"
4,6,139,Boy:,"I can not believe you hast missed the last shot, silly.
"
4,6,140,Robin:,"You're an idiot.
"
4,6,141,Boy:,"No, it's you, the idiot.
"
4,6,142,Father:,"What do you do? You are teammates, hockey players.Teammates do not kiss! Hockey players do not kiss! Oh, my God. I have no son.
"
4,6,143,Barney:,"My poor. Being forced to grow up in Canada with America, right next door.
"
4,6,144,Marshall:,"It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game.
"
4,6,145,Robin:,"And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.
"
4,6,146,Barney:,"The blue line?
"
4,6,147,Robin:,"You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.
"
4,6,148,Lily:,"You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?
"
4,6,149,Robin:,"That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. ""
"
4,6,150,Ted:,"You kept it for quite some time, eh?
"
4,6,151,Robin:,"Yes.
"
4,6,152,Ted:,"It has returned to you.
"
4,6,153,Marshall:,"Sorry.
"
4,6,154,Barney:,"It's hot.
"
4,6,155,Ted (2030):,"And I realized... all my friends were haunted, but there was a difference between my and their ghosts. It was not too late for me.
"
4,6,156,Ted:,"I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up.
"
4,6,157,Barney:,"There, there.
"
4,6,158,Ted:,"There she is!
"
4,6,159,Ted:,"I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?
"
4,6,160,Marshall:,"Well, well you do. You're going to confront it.
"
4,6,161,Ted:,"I will face it.
"
4,6,162,Robin:,"This is so exciting.
"
4,6,163,Ted:,"Bluntly.
"
4,6,164,Lily:,"You're gonna say what?
"
4,6,165,Ted:,"I will say, ""Sorry it did not work. ""We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.
"
4,6,166,Barney:,"You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted.
"
4,6,167,Marshall:,"You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.
"
4,6,168,Ted:,"Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...
"
4,6,169,Marshall:,"Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.
"
4,6,170,Ted:,"That's his problem.
"
4,6,171,Barney:,"Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar.
"
4,6,172,Robin:,"I understand!
"
4,6,173,Ted:,"In the name of all that is sacred...
"
4,6,174,Lily:,"Wait, wait! Where it goes? His taxi has missed the exit for the Lincoln Tunnel.
"
4,6,175,Robin:,"Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?
"
4,6,176,Ted:,"Maybe she goes to his office.
"
4,6,177,Marshall:,"No.
"
4,6,178,Marshall:,"The waiter asked him: ""Do you want covered? ""And she said:"" I'm going home. ""
"
4,6,179,Ted:,"If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. ""At home"" is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!
"
4,6,180,Marshall:,"Finally. Finally, my friend.
"
4,6,181,Ted:,"I have the balls too!
"
4,6,182,Marshall:,"I know and I love it! It's great! Sir, we will pay gladly handle that has been broken. I love Ted angry!
"
4,6,183,Ted:,"Me too!
"
4,6,184,Marshall:,"Lets get out, man, let out.
"
4,6,185,Lily:,"She stops.
"
4,6,186,Ted:,"That's it. That's it!
"
4,6,187,Marshall:,"Yes, Ted. Come on, buddy!
"
4,6,188,Robin:,"Get rid of your demons!
"
4,6,189,Barney:,"I have ants in my leg!
"
4,6,190,Lily:,"OK, wait. Wait...
"
4,6,191,Marshall:,"What are you doing?
"
4,6,192,Lily:,"Wait. Listen, Ted, it's great that you're angry...
"
4,6,193,Marshall:,"Sure.
"
4,6,194,Lily:,".. and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say.
"
4,6,195,Ted:,"I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.
"
4,6,196,Stella:,"Ted, wait.
"
4,6,197,Ted:,"Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life.
"
4,6,198,Stella:,"I know.
"
4,6,199,Ted:,"Okay. (Ted is still in the taxi) This is what I say.
"
4,6,200,Marshall:,"It kills!
"
4,6,201,Barney:,"From cold blood.
"
4,6,202,Lily:,"Okay, tell him that.
"
4,6,203,Ted (2030):,"So I got out of the cab, ready to tell her everything, ready to explode but then...
"
4,6,204,Lucy:,"Mom!
"
4,6,205,Ted (2030):,"Here we go at once. And it was over. At this point, I was not angry. I saw that she was made to be with him.Children, you might think that the only choices are to swallow his anger, or swing at someone. There is another option: you can let it flow, and when you do that, we can forget and move forward. And that was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.It was just not mine. Mine was always there, waiting for me.
"
4,10,1,Ted (2030):,"Why do they fight? What is it hidden in us that drives us to settle disagreements with our fists? (In Lily's class, two boys fight) Whatever it is, this is from the beginning.
"
4,10,2,Lily:,"Stop fighting!
"
4,10,3,Boy 1:,"Why?
"
4,10,4,Lily:,"It's stupid and childish.
"
4,10,5,Boy 2:,"It has been six years. It is stupid and childish.
"
4,10,6,Ted (2030):,"Children, I fought just once in my life. And that's how it happened. You know I have recently been abandoned at the altar. And the worst when it comes to us, apart from being abandoned at the altar, is what happens after. A steady stream, persistent and unbearable pity.
"
4,10,7,Wendy:,"Cranberry Vodka, gin and tonic. Scotch and soda.
"
4,10,8,Ted:,"Thank you. Can I see the menu?
"
4,10,9,Wendy:,"Ted, I'll get you a menu... but I promise I will return.
"
4,10,10,Ted:,"We'll have to go elsewhere. In this bar, I will always be the guy left at the altar. It sucks!
"
4,10,11,Barney:,"Good times.
"
4,10,12,Ted:,"We lost Barney.
"
4,10,13,Robin:,"What?
"
4,10,14,Lily:,"There's a girl there in a sweater wrap. He does not listen to a word they say. Hein, Barney?
"
4,10,15,Barney:,"Leave me alone!
"
4,10,16,Ted:,"He understood, there is little time, he could hold a conversation with just the titles of sitcoms ""black"" of the 70s and 80s.
"
4,10,17,Barney:,"What's going on?
"
4,10,18,Lily:,"Barney, you wanna go and get my stuff does not Marshall?
"
4,10,19,Barney:,"Diff'rent Strokes.
"
4,10,20,Man:,"What is this?
"
4,10,21,Ted (2030):,"I spoke to Doug, children? Not? Well...
"
4,10,22,Ted (2030):,"Doug Martin was in McClaren's bartender. He was always in the corner.
"
4,10,23,Barney:,"You... Been to Ted?
"
4,10,24,Ted:,"It is not play ""You know Ted.""
"
4,10,25,Barney (a pencil in his nose):,"I'm dead? (Doug misses and laughs) I'm dead? (It is disguised as a woman) Tonight... I am a lesbian.
"
4,10,26,Ted (2030):,"There are three things to know about Doug. The first is that Doug is a bit violent.
"
4,10,27,Doug:,".. collapsed, so he's down. And it hits him! He made this face, trembling. What we did is that we left it there. I ressers?
"
4,10,28,Ted (2030):,"The second is that he was weird about her hair...
"
4,10,29,Doug:,"What?
"
4,10,30,Ted:,"What?
"
4,10,31,Doug:,"You look at my hair?
"
4,10,32,Ted:,"No, sir. Not at all.
"
4,10,33,Doug:,"That's a dummy. It's funny? Want to laugh? It's funny?Why you do not tear out?
"
4,10,34,Ted:,"What?
"
4,10,35,Doug:,"Go ahead, tear it out of my head. Go ahead. Want to pull? Go. Go, go and pluck it out. You want to tear my head?Pluck my hairpiece my head. I love you, guys!
"
4,10,36,Ted (2030):,"But the third is that he was very faithful with its regulars.
"
4,10,37,Doug:,"There they are! You want your table?
"
4,10,38,All:,"We will be well by then.
"
4,10,39,Doug:,"Yes? Yes?
"
4,10,40,Ted (2030):,"Maybe a little too faithful.
"
4,10,41,Doug:,"No, that's right, all right. (He goes to the usual table where Ted and his friends are) Lovebirds! Put it elsewhere, this table is reserved. Here we go! Now! Go! We move, my Father. Here we go. OK, guys, here!
"
4,10,42,Ted (2030):,"So that's Doug.
"
4,10,43,Doug:,"What is this?
"
4,10,44,Ted:,"Some guys are sitting at our table. But you know, it's good.
"
4,10,45,Doug:,"Let's go, I take care of that.
"
4,10,46,Lily:,"Damn, there goes.
"
4,10,47,Doug:,"Ladies, if you will join your table. Gentlemen, I need your help out.
"
4,10,48,Ted:,"Our help?
"
4,10,49,Doug:,"We're going down the aisle and fight with these guys.
"
4,10,50,Barney:,"What's going on?
"
4,10,51,Ted:,"Sorry, you just said...
"
4,10,52,Doug:,"These guys are off-handedness. So we go outside and they fit in, OK? It's gonna be fun!
"
4,10,53,Ted:,"He wants to be fought? As with our hands and stuff?
"
4,10,54,Marshall:,"And your feet maybe? I do not know the rules.
"
4,10,55,Ted:,"A fight. We gotta go?
"
4,10,56,Barney:,"No, I would fight for three things, the closing of a stubborn bra, accusations of sexual harassment... 9 of 9! And wanted to vomit when I see someone wearing brown shoes with a black suit.
"
4,10,57,Marshall:,"The fighting is for dummies. We are civilized people, civilized people not fight. Except with a lightsaber, but that's in for 3 or 5 years...
"
4,10,58,Robin:,"That's not true.
"
4,10,59,Marshall:,"I'm on the forums every day. In 3-5 Thanksgiving, I d√©couperai turkey with my saber green.
"
4,10,60,Robin:,"No, I say there are plenty of legitimate reasons to fight, it is perhaps not beautiful, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
"
4,10,61,Ted:,"Yes, I forgot. She is sexy fights.
"
4,10,62,Robin:,"No, it's true! I love it! I have a culture of hockey. If a guy is a fighter, it is rather sexy. And scars, seriously! If a guy has one, it has a Robin. And if he lost a tooth, I lose my panties.
"
4,10,63,Barney:,"I lost my wisdom tooth. Without surgery. Local anesthesia. Frankly, it's nothing.
"
4,10,64,Ted:,"We should go.
"
4,10,65,Lily:,"I can not believe that we have this discussion. Ted, you're 30, you're too old to act like that.
"
4,10,66,Ted (2030):,"I was 30. And of those 30 years, I was struck once.
"
4,10,67,Ted:,"There is an explanation very simp...
"
4,10,68,Ted (2030):,"There was this thing in colo.
"
4,10,69,Ted:,"Today we are going to braid friendship bracelets.
"
4,10,70,Ted (2030):,"In college, I studied Kung-Fu. And some other stuff. For the goat, it would be a few months after.
"
4,10,71,Ted (2030):,"The idea is that I had never beaten.
"
4,10,72,Ted:,"I'm going.
"
4,10,73,Lily:,"No!
"
4,10,74,Marshall:,"Listen to me, trust me, I fought hard. There is no pride to be learned.
"
4,10,75,Ted:,"With which you fought?
"
4,10,76,Marshall:,"My brothers.
"
4,10,77,Barney:,"Yeah, it was surely the ruckus in the playroom of Eriksen.
"
4,10,78,A brother:,"I love the squabbles between brothers!
"
4,10,79,Marshall:,"That's the monster of guilis!
"
4,10,80,Brother 2:,"Patrol Commies!
"
4,10,81,Marshall:,"Wait! Go! Go! Cocoa break.
"
4,10,82,Ted:,"Break cocoa. OK, it's time to fight.
"
4,10,83,Lily:,"Ted, do not do that, you're a good guy. This is your greatest quality.
"
4,10,84,Ted:,"Oh yeah? I seem to remember that this guy was well dumped by his girlfriend for a Taekwondo teacher. It might sound crazy, but... I need that. I think it's an experience I do. I go there.
"
4,10,85,Barney:,"Me too! (Followed by Barney) Guys... watch what face. The next time you see it, it will be distorted as the sexiest possible. Because that's what I am: a real man. I like to fight and do battle in the dirt. You find me a wooden hanger for that?
"
4,10,86,Barney:,"It's been what?
"
4,10,87,Doug:,"I know, huh! Who do now eyeing more my hairpiece?Look what they did!
"
4,10,88,Ted:,"""We""?
"
4,10,89,Doug:,"Yes, ""on"". Come on, we made a great team. Well done guys! We did it!
"
4,10,90,Ted:,"No, you did. There was nothing we.
"
4,10,91,Doug:,"OK, yes, it is clear, I have beaten three types alone. You and you, free drinks for life.
"
4,10,92,Ted:,"He thinks he fought with him.
"
4,10,93,Barney:,"We fought with him. So we will go and tell everyone the legendary story of how we beat types. And everyone will find it great and everyone goes back to bed with me.
"
4,10,94,Ted:,"Come on man, no one will believe we fought, we look at.
"
4,10,95,Barney:,"Oh, it's good...
"
4,10,96,Ted:,"What are you doing?
"
4,10,97,Barney:,"What I should have done there is a lease.
"
4,10,98,Ted:,"What?
"
4,10,99,Barney:,"I dunno, I typed the eye! I even know what I say! I have a great right, either. You ready?
"
4,10,100,Ted:,"To go home?
"
4,10,101,Barney:,"No, for that.
"
4,10,102,Ted:,"You hit me in the nose!
"
4,10,103,Barney:,"Are you crying?
"
4,10,104,Ted:,"Yes, I cry! You hit me in the nose!
"
4,10,105,Barney:,"It's going to swell to death. You're going to look like Owen Wilson. Come on, we go.
"
4,10,106,Ted:,"Ok, but we do not add too. I do not want it to catch proportions.
"
4,10,107,Doug:,"Can Ted arrives, takes off her shoe hit him in the mouth... A, they are! The guys who supported me!
"
4,10,108,Marshall:,"So you fought. Seriously.
"
4,10,109,Ted:,"No, Barney hit us head to pretend. Without in December ', Marshall!
"
4,10,110,Robin:,"Just look at that eye. You look like a bad boy. I did not know you had it in me. You. That you had it in you.
"
4,10,111,Barney:,"You... want to touch?
"
4,10,112,Robin:,"My God, it's hot!
"
4,10,113,Doug:,"The pot of victory! Blackjack! Blackjack! Blackjack!Blackjack! $ 7 50.
"
4,10,114,Marshall:,"Why should I pay?
"
4,10,115,Doug:,"Because thou hast not supported. They supported me.
"
4,10,116,Marshall:,"You know what, Doug? I will gladly pay. And why?As adults do. They pay their glasses, and they fight it. You know what I did when you were kids? That's what I did.
"
4,10,117,Barney:,"Your nails?
"
4,10,118,Marshall:,"I was...
"
4,10,119,Ted:,"The quiz of love in the last Gala?
"
4,10,120,Marshall:,"No. I was...
"
4,10,121,Barney:,"your best to not cry when Big came to Carrie at the end of the film s*x and the City?
"
4,10,122,Marshall:,"You spoiles? No. I'll tell you what I did...
"
4,10,123,Robin:,"Tips to captain the football team because he gave you his ring and you were so cute in your evening gown?
"
4,10,124,Lily:,"I'm sorry.
"
4,10,125,Marshall:,"I hate them! They behave like guys the most virile of the universe, as Crocodile Dundee and David Hasselhoff.
"
4,10,126,Lily:,"It's the guys the most virile of the universe?
"
4,10,127,Marshall:,"I know why they are given all the attention. In fact, it's me, the real hero.
"
4,10,128,Lily:,"Yeah, it's you.
"
4,10,129,Marshall:,"I'm serious, woman. Put it in your pants.
"
4,10,130,Lily:,"You're the man every boy should be and every girl should marry. You know what? I have two boys under way that will not stop fighting. If you come to school tomorrow to tell them your story of choice of the path of nonviolence, it could put them right. And avoid me getting up early to prepare lessons.
"
4,10,131,Marshall:,"Okay. OK. I recadrerai.
"
4,10,132,Boy 1:,"wimp!
"
4,10,133,Marshall:,"What? No! The panda and the koala Mahatma Luther King tell you that story to show...
"
4,10,134,Boy 2:,"Show that you're a wimp?
"
4,10,135,Boy 1:,"Why hast not beaten? You were afraid?
"
4,10,136,Marshall:,"What? I was not afraid! I did a lot of fights, OK?
"
4,10,137,Boy 2:,"You're great! You have to weigh almost 500 pounds.
"
4,10,138,Marshall:,"First, I wear a sweater off, which has horizontal stripes. And I also... I ate salty... So I... You know what? Shut up!
"
4,10,139,Boy 2:,"wimp! Wimp!
"
4,10,140,Woman 1:,"So you've just beaten?
"
4,10,141,Barney:,"Just?
"
4,10,142,Ted:,"Amanda, was it that simple? You know, the fight in melee, it is more than using force against his opponent, huh B?
"
4,10,143,Barney:,"Exactly!
"
4,10,144,Ted:,"It is an art. The noble art, as it were.
"
4,10,145,Woman 2:,"But I do not understand, what they did to deserve this?
"
4,10,146,Barney:,"It may seem insignificant, but they got to our table.
"
4,10,147,Ted:,"At our table.
"
4,10,148,Barney:,"And...
"
4,10,149,Ted:,"No one.
"
4,10,150,Barney:,".. no one sits at our table.
"
4,10,151,Amanda:,"You will beat them up?
"
4,10,152,Barney:,"Let's beat them up. Ted, come on. You two. Our table.Go. Now!
"
4,10,153,Ted:,"What are you doing?
"
4,10,154,Barney:,"Relax, it was Doug. Doug supports us.
"
4,10,155,Ted:,"He's not here tonight.
"
4,10,156,Barney:,"I offer you what? A drink? Money? These two girls over there?
"
4,10,157,Man 1:,"It's you, Ted Mosby.
"
4,10,158,Ted:,"Yes.
"
4,10,159,Male 2:,"And you're Barney Stinson?
"
4,10,160,Barney:,"They know who you are. All right, guys. It lets you go without kick your ass. This time. Okay?
"
4,10,161,Ted:,"That's... What is it?
"
4,10,162,Man 2:,"You are summoned.
"
4,10,163,Man 1:,"You are charged with assault. Enjoy it.
"
4,10,164,Barney:,"That was close.
"
4,10,165,Ted:,"Assault! They continue to attack us!
"
4,10,166,Barney:,"What is the penalty for assault? I'll have a fine?Picking up garbage on the highway? Because I already did that.
"
4,10,167,Marshall:,"I know.
"
4,10,168,Ted (2030):,"In fact, he knew they risked a small community service, surely no criminal charges. But he was furious against us.
"
4,10,169,Marshall:,"You could have a good time in prison.
"
4,10,170,Barney:,"The Prison?
"
4,10,171,Ted:,"I can not go to jail! I could read a bunch of books, writing short stories. Drag me all the time. Seriously, if I get lost really hefty...
"
4,10,172,Barney:,"You can not go to jail! They are dying in the hallways!And meals are really heavy.
"
4,10,173,Marshall:,"You should have thought before beating them.
"
4,10,174,Ted:,"And if we have not done?
"
4,10,175,Marshall:,"No what?
"
4,10,176,Ted:,"beaten. And if Doug had beaten them all alone and we had done nothing?
"
4,10,177,Marshall:,"I knew it! You have not even given a single shot.
"
4,10,178,Barney:,"I hit Ted and me, so...
"
4,10,179,Marshall:,"Who's the wimp now? Answer: you.
"
4,10,180,Ted:,"You can spin us a hand?
"
4,10,181,Marshall:,"You know the old saying: ""If you can not assume, do not pretend to have done, do not laugh and refuses glasses blackjack and not defend your friend, who, coincidentally, lived full of fights with his brothers. ""
"
4,10,182,Barney:,"You gotta help us, Marshall. We're the Three Musketeers! If I let Ted I how long?
"
4,10,183,Robin:,"Barney? I was looking for you. I have tickets for the hockey game tonight. It's stupid. Want to go? It can run late, we could go see a drink after.
"
4,10,184,Marshall:,"Listen to this. You know, this fight? The guys were pretending.
"
4,10,185,Robin:,"Oh, I forgot! Tonight, it is not possible. I can not go to hockey tonight, I have this... This... This...
"
4,10,186,Marshall:,"Good news, I talked to the guys.
"
4,10,187,Ted:,"What guy?
"
4,10,188,Marshall:,"The ones you do not beaten. They will not go to trial.Lawyer.
"
4,10,189,Barney:,"What? They dropped?
"
4,10,190,Marshall:,"Yes, I just told them you were wimps. It has made us laugh. Poilade good, actually. I said that you did manicure every month.
"
4,10,191,Barney:,"Weeks, Wolverine... Some are careful.
"
4,10,192,Marshall:,"And you played the harp in the dance club of the pre-reform in college.
"
4,10,193,Ted:,"You're at least they said we were one of the best medieval music group of the academy?
"
4,10,194,Marshall:,"Sure. We were all agreed that it was a guy who had beaten and that you had nothing to do with it...
"
4,10,195,Ted:,"Wait, so... they attack Doug.
"
4,10,196,Marshall:,"Affirmative.
"
4,10,197,Ted:,"The angry, irrational, violent Doug, who now knows, you pushed under a bus.
"
4,10,198,Doug (on phone):,"They what?
"
4,10,199,Barney:,"We can tell you...
"
4,10,200,Doug:,"Explain what? How you have me stabbed in the back just under my eyes?
"
4,10,201,Lily:,"Robin, I'm afraid.
"
4,10,202,Robin:,"Yeah, Doug sees someone?
"
4,10,203,Lily:,"You visit? You really should.
"
4,10,204,Ted:,"Look, you do not understand, you beat these guys all by yourself.
"
4,10,205,Marshall:,"It's true. They have nothing to do with it. Look at them.
"
4,10,206,Barney:,"It's Ted's fault!
"
4,10,207,Marshall:,"Look at him.
"
4,10,208,Ted:,"Yes, look at me!
"
4,10,209,Marshall:,"It would not 5 minutes in combat.
"
4,10,210,Ted:,"I could hold at least 5...
"
4,10,211,Marshall:,"It is as limp as spaghetti.
"
4,10,212,Ted:,"Yes, spaghetti with meatballs... Mate it. Look!
"
4,10,213,Marshall:,"No.
"
4,10,214,Doug:,"OK, maybe it was... than me. In fact, it makes sense. I have many black holes. In short, I have always supported. I expected much from you. And you did what? Nothing. We can not count on you. No wonder your girlfriend has dumped you.
"
4,10,215,Ted (2030):,"And here, children, the only fight I've ever had.What can I say? For starters, a punch to the face, it hurts...very badly. And what hurts more? Ca (Doug gives him a punch too) All I remember is waking up.
"
4,10,216,Barney:,"OK, I'm hot. Let's go.
"
4,10,217,Ted:,"A fight was not a good idea, actually. And that's my story.
"
4,10,218,Lily:,"And what did you learn?
"
4,10,219,Ted:,"I learned that it is not right to fight and must never do.
"
4,10,220,Lily:,"Questions?
"
4,10,221,Boy 1:,"Where you find them?
"
4,10,222,Boy 2:,"I know! Was a big sale at the market for wimps?
"
4,10,223,Children:,"wimp! Wimp!
"
4,10,224,Ted (2030):,"I have not told them what had really happened.
"
4,10,225,Barney:,"OK, I'm hot. Let's go. What has happened?
"
4,10,226,Marshall:,"Ca
"
4,10,227,Ted:,"Damn!
"
4,10,228,Marshall:,"Apparently, Uncle Marshall and his brothers did more than fight.
"
4,10,229,Robin:,"Marshall looks like. He lost weight?
"
4,10,230,Lily:,"S *****, do not even think about.
"
4,10,231,Ted (2030):,"Children, I would tell you that fighting is malet need to do it, but it's useless. So I tell you this: do you ever fight with Uncle Marshall. It's a big tared.
"
4,10,232,Marshall:,"It's so good to be home. Mom, Lily, good job. ""Good meat, good food, good Lord, to the food. ""No? OK, let's go. Put your glasses. (Everyone dons glasses and takes out a sword Marshall Green) Okay, pass me the plate. Lily, white or red meat?
"
4,10,233,Lily:,"Red! Honey, be careful.
"
4,4,1,Robin:,"Barney's crazy if he thinks it'll work.
"
4,4,2,Marshall:,"I think it'll work.
"
4,4,3,Lily:,"I hope not.
"
4,4,4,Ted:,"There he is.
"
4,4,5,Barney (old):,"You there, what's your name?
"
4,4,6,Woman:,"Excuse me?
"
4,4,7,Barney (old):,"Your name, woman, what's your name?
"
4,4,8,Barney (old):,"I knew it. You are ""the"" Cindy, one that can change everything and bring us to our downfall. Listen to me, Cindy. I am Barney Stinson, and I have an urgent mission from the future.
"
4,4,9,Cindy:,"From the future?
"
4,4,10,Barney (old):,"The future, and I can prove it to you. In exactly four seconds, the woman at this table will slap this man.
"
4,4,11,Ted:,"What are you doing?
"
4,4,12,Barney:,"In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight.
"
4,4,13,Cindy:,"What? I...
"
4,4,14,Cindy:,"You mean what?
"
4,4,15,Barney (old):,"I have not the time to explain. I must return to reality accelerator before the vortex closes. Only you can save us, Cindy. I must go!
"
4,4,16,Lily:,"Well, the movers arrive in 14 hours. We have to go back to finish the boxes.
"
4,4,17,Robin:,"You have not finished? Why is it so long?
"
4,4,18,Ted:,"The best memories of our 20 years were held in it. It's not that throw stuff in a box. You look back at the past.
"
4,4,19,Robin:,"Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour.
"
4,4,20,Lily:,"A half hour?
"
4,4,21,Robin:,"I could take 20 minutes, but a friend called me in tears.
"
4,4,22,Marshall:,"Moving is very moving.
"
4,4,23,Ted:,"But it is. Finally, everything changes. I will live with Stella, you will be in your new apartment. You start a new job in Tokyo. This is the end of an era. We should make a toast, but not with the usual sh1t. Your bottle of Scotch the most expensive.
"
4,4,24,Wendy:,"This is a Glen McKenna 50 years, and it is $ 2 500.
"
4,4,25,Ted:,"Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?
"
4,4,26,Barney:,"Vive la vodka.
"
4,4,27,Robin:,"It will not work.
"
4,4,28,Cindy:,"My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?
"
4,4,29,Barney:,"I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on.
"
4,4,30,Cindy:,"Global warming?
"
4,4,31,Barney:,"My God! How do you know that?
"
4,4,32,Ted:,"Look at this. A photo of the day we moved. So many good memories.
"
4,4,33,Robin:,"Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away.
"
4,4,34,Ted:,"So you keep a photograph?
"
4,4,35,Robin:,"It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess.
"
4,4,36,Ted:,"Why not?
"
4,4,37,Lily:,"Oh, dear. That's what the guys know that after moving in with a woman. All your stuff are idiots.
"
4,4,38,Ted:,"Like what?
"
4,4,39,Lily:,"Like everything else you bought the medieval festivals.
"
4,4,40,Ted:,"There is not enough drinks in the world that I drop my scourge.
"
4,4,41,Marshall:,"As you will not get bail, I thought you could pay me half.
"
4,4,42,Ted:,"Wait, why I pay more?
"
4,4,43,Marshall:,"Because you've treated this apart as John Bonham treated his nervous system.
"
4,4,44,Ted:,"That's not true.
"
4,4,45,Marshall:,"Proof A.
"
4,4,46,Marshall:,"What is it?
"
4,4,47,Ted:,"An Encyclopedia ""World Book"" of 1986. It is with these that I grew up.
"
4,4,48,Marshall:,"Encyclopedia?
"
4,4,49,Ted:,"Do you think we should say-die encyclo-pil. It's a common mistake. But if you look at the direction of the bar on the ""e"". The symbol of this encyclopedia, you'll know it is a diacritic which aims to change...
"
4,4,50,Marshall:,"You know, it'll have you ""dia-pays"" for it.
"
4,4,51,Marshall:,"But you've ever done. Second, the evidence B.
"
4,4,52,Ted:,"Hello, good topics. Look what I won at the festival.
"
4,4,53,Marshall:,"You're also responsible for damage to Robin when she was your girlfriend.
"
4,4,54,Robin:,"What damage did I do?
"
4,4,55,Marshall:,"Do you remember the time you got drunk the pack of beer and you've become Super Canadian?
"
4,4,56,Robin:,"Stanley Cup game six? The Rangers will regret having met with the Canucks.
"
4,4,57,Marshall:,"$ 20 if you manage to run it through the door.
"
4,4,58,Robin:,"You're more amazing than a Tim Hortons donut. Timmy Ho!
"
4,4,59,Robin:,"I'll give you the teeth of happiness. A little here, a little there.
"
4,4,60,Lily:,"Give me the stick.
"
4,4,61,Robin:,"Get out, bouseuse.
"
4,4,62,Lily:,"Let's go!
"
4,4,63,Ted:,"Catch it, guys!
"
4,4,64,Robin:,"I'll break!
"
4,4,65,Ted:,"Girls, stop!
"
4,4,66,Marshall:,"For America.
"
4,4,67,Ted:,"It's good enough!
"
4,4,68,Barney:,"It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!
"
4,4,69,Ted:,"Barney's fault entirely. As fat burning on the mantelpiece, for that matter.
"
4,4,70,Ted (2030):,"Children, to understand the history of the burn, I must tell you the story of the intervention for our friend, Stewart.
"
4,4,71,Stewart:,"What's going on?
"
4,4,72,Man:,"This is an intervention.
"
4,4,73,Women:,"Alcohol has changed you, Stewart. We recognize you more. And I love the man I married.
"
4,4,74,Stewart:,"Thank you. This is the boost I need. I love you all.
"
4,4,75,Barney:,"This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!
"
4,4,76,Stewart:,"No.
"
4,4,77,Barney:,"Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?
"
4,4,78,Ted (2030):,"This evening, we celebrated our first successful intervention.
"
4,4,79,Robin:,"I'm really proud that we have helped Stewart.
"
4,4,80,Lily:,"Yes, what a moment of incredible human sincerity.
"
4,4,81,Marshall:,"It's true. We live.
"
4,4,82,Barney:,"You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?
"
4,4,83,Lily:,"Yes, it's been two weeks.
"
4,4,84,Marshall:,"Two wonderful weeks... and oh yes, I will continue to wear it.
"
4,4,85,Lily:,"This is an intervention.
"
4,4,86,Ted:,"About the hat.
"
4,4,87,Marshall:,"I control. I can remove it whenever I want.
"
4,4,88,Robin:,"""Dear Marshall, I do not like that stupid hat. I want to cut with a scythe. Or, cut the chisel, for you looks like a real jerk. ""
"
4,4,89,Ted (2030):,"After that, the interventions have become frequent in the apartment.
"
4,4,90,Lily:,"Oh my God. This is one of p'tain of pleasant surprise. This is about what?
"
4,4,91,Ted:,"This is about the exaggerated English accent.
"
4,4,92,Lily:,"P'tain.
"
4,4,93,Robin:,"Self Tanner? They entice you with a coupon, and after it becomes addictive.
"
4,4,94,Lily:,"We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest.
"
4,4,95,Barney:,"What?
"
4,4,96,Robin:,"The magic tricks.
"
4,4,97,Lily:,"Specifically, those with fire.
"
4,4,98,Barney:,"The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage! (There is a magic trick, but set fire to the banner) Thanks! Oh, sh1t.
"
4,4,99,Lily:,"It smells like hair!
"
4,4,100,Ted (2030):,"And here the history of the burn.
"
4,4,101,Ted:,"It's weird. By removing the closet, I thought I saw the banner.
"
4,4,102,Marshall:,"And?
"
4,4,103,Ted:,"And the flag was burned. Why new? And there are letters from you all, with ""Ted"" written on it. You prepare a response for me?
"
4,4,104,Lily:,"Well, that was stupid. Yes, forget it.
"
4,4,105,Ted:,"That was why? The sandals? Hair products?
"
4,4,106,Marshall:,"No Stella.
"
4,4,107,Ted:,"My God, it was for Stella.
"
4,4,108,Marshall:,"I just said ""No Stella."" It was perhaps for your hearing problems.
"
4,4,109,Ted:,"What?
"
4,4,110,Marshall:,"It's getting serious. You see?
"
4,4,111,Ted:,"You think I should not marry Stella. You think I should not marry.
"
4,4,112,Marshall:,"We want him. We are all really happy for you.
"
4,4,113,Lily:,"Like I said, it was stupid.
"
4,4,114,Ted:,"Obviously, it was not, it had agreed to make interventions more stupid to work on interventions.
"
4,4,115,Ted:,"We made too many interventions.
"
4,4,116,Ted:,"What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?
"
4,4,117,Barney (incoming):,"Yes! In the mouth! You said that the ""Barney the future"" work out. You told me I was crazy. My shrink told me I was crazy. Which is the narcissist with severe emotional disorders, Dr. Grossbard? A banner of intervention?That's what?
"
4,4,118,Ted:,"Stella.
"
4,4,119,Barney:,"""I can not remain indifferent... ""
"
4,4,120,Ted:,"You kept it on you?
"
4,4,121,Barney:,"Please. ""I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... ""Flames! Oh, sh1t! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, ""glass half full"", but I think they become beasts.
"
4,4,122,Marshall:,"Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.
"
4,4,123,Barney:,"I meet this challenge.
"
4,4,124,Marshall:,"What challenge?
"
4,4,125,Barney:,"Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup.
"
4,4,126,Marshall:,"I did not challenge. I would love to see it, but I've not challenged.
"
4,4,127,Ted:,"I want to hear the other letters.
"
4,4,128,Lily:,"This is ridiculous. It changed his mind.
"
4,4,129,Ted:,"And if you changed yet? Go Lily, listen to yours.
"
4,4,130,Lily:,"""The capabilities of Gilbert reading have improved considerably... ""This is a letter I had to give one of my students.
"
4,4,131,Woman:,"Things go too fast between you and a girl named Stella?
"
4,4,132,Boy:,"I'd like.
"
4,4,133,Ted:,"I can hear yours?
"
4,4,134,Robin:,"""Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pe-die, not encyclo-pil-die. Why you always want to say things so pretentious? Looks like a moron, and it's cr-e-tin and non-cr-ay-tin. ""
"
4,4,135,Ted:,"You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella?
"
4,4,136,Robin:,"I have not written. I am your ex. I told myself that everything I say is offensive. In addition, I am sexier it, so who cares?
"
4,4,137,Marshall:,"Water has flowed under the bridge...
"
4,4,138,Ted:,"Come on.
"
4,4,139,Marshall:,"""Dear Ted, Stella seems to be wonderful. But you do not know enough to get married. You do not know probably not enough to get involved in raising a child with her. You do not restore her service or her child or yourself by throwing yourself like that. Just take a little longer. "" It was there for months, OK?That was before we know Stella and that way as she's great and what you train super torque. That's why we decided to not make this statement.
"
4,4,140,Ted:,"Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it.
"
4,4,141,Marshall:,"And we're here.
"
4,4,142,Robin:,"And we hope you're not sorry.
"
4,4,143,Ted:,"Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried.
"
4,4,144,Lily:,"But concerns that a completely expelled.
"
4,4,145,Ted:,"But you score a point. It all happened very quickly.
"
4,4,146,Marshall:,"You know what? This may be because... when it's good, you know.
"
4,4,147,Ted:,"I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Lily, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember?
"
4,4,148,Marshall:,"Of course it does. My sensors indicate that your shortbread levels are dangerously low.
"
4,4,149,Ted:,"My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Lily spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month?
"
4,4,150,Lily:,"It was sophisticated.
"
4,4,151,Ted:,"My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero!
"
4,4,152,Robin:,"What are you doing?
"
4,4,153,Ted:,"I unpack. I never leave this apartment.
"
4,4,154,Lily:,"Ted, stop unpacking. You're in the process of pinball.
"
4,4,155,Ted:,"I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!
"
4,4,156,Barney (old):,"Good evening, young lady. You want a caramel?What do you mean, ""nothing in common""? We're both older.
"
4,4,157,Woman:,"You're cute. How old are you?
"
4,4,158,Barney:,"83 years. How old are you?
"
4,4,159,Female:,"31 years.
"
4,4,160,Lily:,"Ted going bonkers. The movers arrive in 10 hours. His bride awaits in New Jersey. We must do something.
"
4,4,161,Marshall:,"I'm on it. Hey, man?
"
4,4,162,Ted:,"Hey.
"
4,4,163,Marshall:,"Come here a minute.
"
4,4,164,Ted:,"What?
"
4,4,165,Marshall:,"Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the knife? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave!
"
4,4,166,Robin:,"Listen up! You sound like that big beta colo. ""Mom, Dad, I want to go. Cool boys play hide and seek with my inhaler. ""
"
4,4,167,Marshall:,"I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding.
"
4,4,168,Robin:,"You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily.
"
4,4,169,Lily:,"This is the black hole where dreams go to die. I move it, either.
"
4,4,170,Robin:,"Come on.
"
4,4,171,Lily:,"Guys, finish unpacking. I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump.
"
4,4,172,Robin:,"My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you.
"
4,4,173,Lily:,"Oh, honey.
"
4,4,174,Marshall:,"Everybody says it's good to change, right? But it's what's good?
"
4,4,175,Ted:,"Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite!
"
4,4,176,Ted:,"Oh, my God!
"
4,4,177,Barney:,"I think someone owes me $ 200.
"
4,4,178,Marshall:,"Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...
"
4,4,179,Barney (old):,"This proves that I will be as great as that when I have 80 years. Tope my arthritis.
"
4,4,180,Ted:,"I am moving to New Jersey.
"
4,4,181,Lily:,"What?
"
4,4,182,Ted:,"And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan.
"
4,4,183,Robin:,"Why?
"
4,4,184,Ted:,"Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?
"
4,4,185,Barney (old):,"You mean great? I am 80 years old guy, and I pack a girl of 22 years.
"
4,4,186,Woman:,"Take me with you, darling. I want to see your medals from World War II.
"
4,4,187,Barney (old):,"In an instant my child.
"
4,4,188,Marshall:,"Okay, it matters not.
"
4,4,189,Barney (old):,"What? Why?
"
4,4,190,Robin:,"It is French, it's like playing tennis without a net.
"
4,4,191,Ted:,"You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition: you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Marshall and Lily, in their apartment and Robin in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day... The day we closed one chapter of our lives incredibly, to open a new one.
"
4,4,192,Woman:,"I had to leave my laptop...
"
4,4,193,Ted:,"Remove from here.
"
4,4,194,Ted (2030):,"And a year later, that's exactly what we did.
"
4,4,195,Ted:,"So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at $ 2 500 for a year of hell.
"
4,4,196,Robin:,"Amazing.
"
4,4,197,Barney:,"It's amazing.
"
4,4,198,Ted:,"It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10?
"
4,4,199,Marshall:,"Not at all.
"
4,4,200,Barney:,"I would much Red Bull.
"
4,4,201,Robin:,"Wendy, you can take a picture?
"
4,4,202,Ted (2030):,"Many things we changed this year, but some have remained the same.
"
4,4,203,Lily:,"So if we continued the evening up there?
"
4,4,204,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
4,4,205,Ted:,"Good idea. I have the tape.
"
4,4,206,Barney (old):,"What...?
"
4,4,207,Robin:,"Barney is an intervention.
"
4,4,208,Barney (old):,"Sorry, I hear you.
"
4,4,209,Marshall:,"That's enough, the trick of ""old.""
"
4,4,210,Barney (old):,"The trick in the middle?
"
4,4,211,Lily:,"Forget it.
"
4,4,212,Barney (old):,"Leave baby? I love this old rhyme!
"
4,4,213,Ted:,"I will get my problem.
"
4,4,214,Barney:,"You're going to get my boat?
"
4,5,1,Ted:,"Hi.
"
4,5,2,Lily:,"Hi. How are you?
"
4,5,3,Stella (taking the glass of Barney):,"I'll just finish this.
"
4,5,4,Ted:,"It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us.
"
4,5,5,Stella:,"You know, you dream of the perfect wedding since you been little girl.
"
4,5,6,Lily:,"Yeah.
"
4,5,7,Marshall:,"Bluntly.
"
4,5,8,Stella:,"My sister steals my dream wedding. So every little detail on Shelter Island, the sun managed to sleep...
"
4,5,9,Sister Stella:,".. near the beach in the old family home. This is my dream wedding.
"
4,5,10,Stella (Ted taking the glass):,"I'll finish it.
"
4,5,11,Ted:,"It seems that the lamb is great here.
"
4,5,12,Nora:,"I'm vegan. I wish I could silence that voice in me that says eating animals is murder, but I guess I'm not as strong as you.
"
4,5,13,Ted:,"Did you need protein. I take the lamb.
"
4,5,14,Ted:,"New objective: Our marriage is to kick the ass of hers.Our marriage is to take the head of his, press it down the toilet and flush 20 times.
"
4,5,15,Lily:,"Ted, in high school, his marriage was you, right?
"
4,5,16,Stella:,"You know, she always wants to overtake. I like it, but there is a part of me that would like it all falls apart.
"
4,5,17,Nora:,"I hate it! I hate him. God, this steak is good. 4 days before and he fled with a consultant from Whole Foods? I do my make-up more for him. I do not shower more for him. I shave armpits more for him.
"
4,5,18,Ted:,"Hard to know where is the problem.
"
4,5,19,Nora:,"Now, so close to the wedding... Got some bacon or something in the sauce. I love it. I would not be refunded. I will lose thousands of dollars.
"
4,5,20,Ted (2030):,"Children in a relationship, you develop as a telepathy with your partner.
"
4,5,21,Stella:,"You think about what? It might help.
"
4,5,22,Ted:,"No, Stella, it should help. Pay for dinner. Do not worry.Taking Charge.
"
4,5,23,Stella:,"It's true. Recovering your marriage, we reimburse you all that you paid for. Ted and I are getting married Sunday.
"
4,5,24,Ted:,"We get married on Sunday? It is sure to be ready for this?
"
4,5,25,Stella:,"I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ""ready"" for it, but it has ever been. That's why we had never married. Come on, must be spontaneous, I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.
"
4,5,26,Ted:,"I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous. (He throws a glass of water on his face) I would not have done that.
"
4,5,27,Ted (2030):,"Children, morality often happens at the end of the story, but this one is too important, I will say now: Never, never, invite ex to your wedding. If I was given this advice, it would have changed everything.
"
4,5,28,Ted:,"We need you to come, this is my marriage.
"
4,5,29,Robin:,"I can not. I am in Tokyo. This is my first week. I can not leave like this. In addition, I am finally serious information.
"
4,5,30,Ted (2030):,"Robin was serious information.
"
4,5,31,Ted (2030):,"It was the first English news channel in Japan. Of course, the info was a little different there.
"
4,5,32,Robin:,"The board of the Fed voted not to change the... rates.
"
4,5,33,Ted:,"This is my marriage. You gotta be there.
"
4,5,34,Robin:,"OK, I'll be there. I gotta go. Good evening. And I'm Robin Scherbatsky. The talks have been arrested in the Middle East. Despite a promising start in the final negotiations, the talks foundered on security.
"
4,5,35,Ted:,"It is.
"
4,5,36,Barney:,"Okay, burial of bachelorhood. Tonight, I have three exotic dancers most flexible physically and mentally that you've ever seen...
"
4,5,37,Ted:,"No time.
"
4,5,38,Barney:,"I'll tell you.
"
4,5,39,Ted:,"Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow.
"
4,5,40,Barney:,"What?
"
4,5,41,Lily:,"No ""You not married, Ted?"" No ""You're making a big mistake, Ted?"" Have you stopped the fight against marriage?
"
4,5,42,Barney:,"No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know...
"
4,5,43,Barney:,"I worked on an issue of utmost importance. I admit I was baffled. Until I decided to take the bull by the horns.(Barney written on a board: how to lie down again with Robin) Then, finally, I d√©cryptais code. ""GIVE THE MARRIAGE OF TED. ""
"
4,5,44,Lily:,"So you come back to Robin.
"
4,5,45,Barney:,"Let's hope. This weekend is my best chance to start with it.
"
4,5,46,Lily:,"You'll never there. Too many opportunities. The first bridesmaid drunk, you'll have your head under the dress as a photographer of yesteryear.
"
4,5,47,Barney:,"Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw.
"
4,5,48,Ted (2030):,"And the day before the wedding, Stella and I made the trip to Shelter Island. With others not far away.
"
4,5,49,Lily:,"It's not really the place I imagined for the wedding of Ted.
"
4,5,50,Barney:,"""The Collective Namaste Yoga and Meditation.""
"
4,5,51,Marshall:,"I know about you, but I will not namaster here too long.
"
4,5,52,Lily:,"Honey, will see the dirty hippie to the reservation there, we, we'll take to drink.
"
4,5,53,Barney:,"You have anything like Scotch?
"
4,5,54,Bartender:,"In the center, we have a strict anti-alcohol.
"
4,5,55,Marshall:,"Super, meals included, right?
"
4,5,56,Woman:,"Yes, and they are all 100% vegan.
"
4,5,57,Barney:,"I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?
"
4,5,58,Marshall:,"There's no meat.
"
4,5,59,Lily:,"There's no alcohol.
"
4,5,60,Marshall:,"Even worse, I'm 90% sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors.
"
4,5,61,Ted:,"Guys, Stella and I have a little problem.
"
4,5,62,Stella:,"The programs are great. It is not our names on it, but otherwise it looks nice.
"
4,5,63,Ted:,"Actually, I spoke to Robin. It is a little late, but it will be there on time.
"
4,5,64,Stella:,"You're invited Robin?
"
4,5,65,Ted:,"Yes, of course.
"
4,5,66,Stella:,"You gave me no warning. I'm not sure what to think.
"
4,5,67,Ted:,"Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him.
"
4,5,68,Stella:,"Yes, but it's your ex girlfriend. It's weird.
"
4,5,69,Ted:,"But no.
"
4,5,70,Stella:,"It's weird. Not what you imagine is to see her boyfriend's ex marriage.
"
4,5,71,Robin:,"Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day.
"
4,5,72,Stella:,"When the former are present, I dunno, it brings back...things unresolved. Close with your ex, do you know that the flame will not turn back?
"
4,5,73,Ted:,"Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.
"
4,5,74,Stella:,"Have you bet money against you in this quarrel?
"
4,5,75,Ted:,"She already has his ticket.
"
4,5,76,Stella:,"It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy.
"
4,5,77,Ted:,"It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.
"
4,5,78,Stella:,"No, Tony is the last person I want to see here, OK? And Robin is the penultimate.
"
4,5,79,Ted:,"Robin will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that.
"
4,5,80,Robin:,"Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11% over last year.
"
4,5,81,Ted:,"What should I do?
"
4,5,82,Marshall:,"I know. I understand something is ""no ex"". Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone.
"
4,5,83,Barney:,"What? No. Robin must come.
"
4,5,84,Ted:,"That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl.
"
4,5,85,Lily:,"I do not care, why do such.
"
4,5,86,Barney:,"Dude, Robin has to be there.
"
4,5,87,Marshall:,"It should not come.
"
4,5,88,Barney:,"What are you parl...
"
4,5,89,Ted:,"Aldrin Justice, the last word.
"
4,5,90,Lily:,"OK, this would be weird without Robin. But not contradict the bride.
"
4,5,91,Ted:,"I will not tell him to come.
"
4,5,92,Marshall:,"It's the right decision.
"
4,5,93,Ted:,"It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.
"
4,5,94,Barney:,"Co-witness, I'll handle this.
"
4,5,95,Robin:,"Hello?
"
4,5,96,Barney:,"Robin, where are you?
"
4,5,97,Robin:,"I'm off to the airport.
"
4,5,98,Barney:,"OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone.
"
4,5,99,Ted:,"OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with.
"
4,5,100,Lily:,"You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.
"
4,5,101,Ted:,"What do you mean by ""delicate""?
"
4,5,102,Lily:,"The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control.
"
4,5,103,Marshall:,"Do not you remember?
"
4,5,104,Lily:,"The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?
"
4,5,105,Marshall:,"After a while, is that the waffle.
"
4,5,106,Lily:,"Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.
"
4,5,107,Ted:,"What do I do?
"
4,5,108,Lily:,"You wait for the next crisis, the rules you, you're a hero.After, you dealt with on about Robin, but this time she will say yes.
"
4,5,109,Ted:,"And if there is no other crises?
"
4,5,110,Lily:,"This is a bride. There will be another crisis.
"
4,5,111,Ted:,"There is a new crisis.
"
4,5,112,Lily:,"Great! What is it?
"
4,5,113,Stella:,"My daughter, my daughter does not come to our wedding.
"
4,5,114,Ted:,"What?
"
4,5,115,Stella:,"Tony was the lead here tomorrow, but cash hurt my marriage, and he will not take him. It's been 5 years. Why not turn the page?
"
4,5,116,Ted:,"So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Robin comes to marriage.
"
4,5,117,Nora:,"You are Barney?
"
4,5,118,Barney:,"Yes.
"
4,5,119,Nora:,"I heard you were a real b*st*rd, so listen. Tomorrow night, I want to do things so nasty and depraved that I forget that it was supposed to be my wedding.
"
4,5,120,Barney:,"I'm here with someone.
"
4,5,121,Nora:,"Bring her.
"
4,5,122,Lily:,"You'll never get there.
"
4,5,123,Ted (2030):,"So the morning of my wedding, I made the way home Tony, to take Lucy.
"
4,5,124,Ted:,"We did a little karate?
"
4,5,125,Tony:,"Sorry, sorry dude. You have my alarm activated defense. You must remember these things. Stay alert, rest life.
"
4,5,126,Ted:,"OK.
"
4,5,127,Tony:,"What brings you here? I thought you'd be in a bridal suite with my wife.
"
4,5,128,Ted:,"Not yet. Soon.
"
4,5,129,Tony:,"That's right, tonight is the big night. Oh, man, you gonna make love to the mother of my daughter.
"
4,5,130,Ted:,"Actually, I've already had s*x many times. Why I always corrects people?
"
4,5,131,Tony:,"You and Stella. You're lucky. I could just... I am very happy for you.
"
4,5,132,Ted:,"Look, here's the thing...
"
4,5,133,Tony:,"You can not take it.
"
4,5,134,Ted:,"Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me.
"
4,5,135,Tony:,"You're right, man. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... You see all... made me realize what I had.
"
4,5,136,Ted:,"Let's cuddle.
"
4,5,137,Tony:,"I'm sorry. Lucy is everything to me. I will lose it with this family, I am not one.
"
4,5,138,Ted:,"But you're part of.
"
4,5,139,Tony:,"I have not been invited to the wedding.
"
4,5,140,Ted:,"You are now.
"
4,5,141,Tony:,"""Road Trip"" OK? (They are on a boat) ""Road Trip 2, back in the car.""
"
4,5,142,Nora:,"This is the big day. You hydrate?
"
4,5,143,Barney:,"Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson...
"
4,5,144,Nora:,"Your back will look like a Jackson Pollock.
"
4,5,145,Barney:,"I regret to inform you that at this time...
"
4,5,146,Nora:,"I have been vegan for 2 years. I need meat.
"
4,5,147,Barney:,"There are currently no positions available.
"
4,5,148,Nora:,"I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary.
"
4,5,149,Barney:,"I will not do, huh?
"
4,5,150,Lily:,"No chance.
"
4,5,151,Ted:,"Let me talk to Stella first.
"
4,5,152,Lucy:,"Mom! Ted invited Dad!
"
4,5,153,Stella:,"Hi, my heart. You've missed. Just one second, OK?Tony invited you? At our wedding? This was discussed. No ex at our wedding. Why did you do that?
"
4,5,154,Robin:,"What did Ted this time?
"
4,5,155,Stella:,"What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.
"
4,5,156,Ted:,"To be fair... your ex is here.
"
4,5,157,Stella:,"You've invited!
"
4,5,158,Ted:,"Come on, it's not weird.
"
4,5,159,Stella:,"It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal.
"
4,5,160,Ted (2030):,"The children, if I had left Stella talking to Robin, this story would have ended differently.
"
4,5,161,Robin:,"I understand.
"
4,5,162,Tony:,"I get it.
"
4,5,163,Man:,"For the first time, Ted and Stella Mosby.
"
4,5,164,Ted (2030):,"And now, how I met your mother.
"
4,5,165,Stella:,"Your father has finally finished drooling? Who wants ice cream?
"
4,5,166,Ted (2030):,"But I have not done.
"
4,5,167,Ted:,"You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.
"
4,5,168,Stella:,"Of course.
"
4,5,169,Ted:,"Sorry to have run away like that.
"
4,5,170,Robin:,"It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it...
"
4,5,171,Ted:,"You can not come to the wedding.
"
4,5,172,Robin:,"thank you God!
"
4,5,173,Ted:,"What?
"
4,5,174,Robin:,"It's weird.
"
4,5,175,Ted:,"It's not weird.
"
4,5,176,Robin:,"It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?
"
4,5,177,Stella:,"Take that, bitch! I won!
"
4,5,178,Ted:,"It was broken, there is more than a year.
"
4,5,179,Robin:,"Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.
"
4,5,180,Ted:,"So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.
"
4,5,181,Robin:,"That's not it. It's just...
"
4,5,182,Ted:,"Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.
"
4,5,183,Robin:,"Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over.
"
4,5,184,Ted:,"It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...
"
4,5,185,Robin:,"I quit my job.
"
4,5,186,Ted:,"You what?
"
4,5,187,Robin:,"I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours.
"
4,5,188,Ted:,"What does that mean?
"
4,5,189,Robin:,"You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.
"
4,5,190,Ted:,"I did the rain.
"
4,5,191,Robin:,"It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.
"
4,5,192,Ted:,"I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.
"
4,5,193,Bartender:,"Big fight?
"
4,5,194,Robin:,"Yes.
"
4,5,195,Barman:,"There you go. It is for me.
"
4,5,196,Robin:,"You stop it. (Robin drinks the glass of a sudden) My God, so, stop.
"
4,5,197,Robin:,"I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?
"
4,5,198,Barney:,"Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.
"
4,5,199,Robin:,"I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.
"
4,5,200,Barney:,"No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...
"
4,5,201,Robin:,"And a girl naked, tied to your bed.
"
4,5,202,Barney:,"The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order...
"
4,5,203,Robin:,"In addition, Barney.
"
4,5,204,Nora:,"OK, let's go. Who's that?
"
4,5,205,Barney:,"The girl on reception.
"
4,5,206,Ted (2030):,"Children, sometimes you think you live a story, but the truth turns out to be quite different. (Robin is on board a boat, Ted is in his room and read a map and Stella is also on board) In those days, I thought it covered only the presence of Robin marriage. (Stella Tony covers his coat) If only I had understood what it was about.
"
4,5,207,Stella:,"Have his former close... it reveals unresolved problems.
"
4,5,208,Stella:,"With your ex not far, which tells you that the flame will not turn back?
"
4,5,209,Stella:,"It's as if it was not over between you.
"
4,5,210,Stella:,"I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ""ready"" for it.
"
4,5,211,Tony:,"You see all... made me realize what I had.
"
4,5,212,Stella:,"I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.
"
4,5,213,Ted (2030):,"Seriously, kids, do not invite your ex to your wedding.
"
4,11,1,Robin:,"Hi!
"
4,11,2,Marshall:,"Hi.
"
4,11,3,Ted:,"It is freezing outside. Where is your jacket?
"
4,11,4,Robin:,"I'm Canadian. No need to coat. This kind of weather does not scare me.
"
4,11,5,Marshall:,"It looks like a spring day in Minnesota, there was no q'il all the taxis, the skyscrapers and the blacks.
"
4,11,6,Ted:,"There are no black people?
"
4,11,7,Marshall:,"Not if Prince is on tour.
"
4,11,8,Ted:,"my sister's plane arrived an hour ago, or would like a meteorologist, hurricane between Heather on Lands.
"
4,11,9,Lily:,"Go. It's not like that.
"
4,11,10,Ted:,"That's the history of Heather. It has been six years and three high schools for his baccalaureate. She took the opportunity to ruin two cars, being married for five days, and spent nine weeks in a tree only to find that no one intended to kill him. And there, Heather said she moved to New York.
"
4,11,11,Lily:,"Great news.
"
4,11,12,Ted:,"It will not come out. Remember when she talked of going to college here? And then the day of admission...
"
4,11,13,Ted:,"Where are my TV and my couch?
"
4,11,14,Woman:,"I have sold tickets for the concert of Nine Inch Nails.
"
4,11,15,Ted:,"Nothing but the TV is 2000 balls.
"
4,11,16,Woman:,"A last minute flight is expensive.
"
4,11,17,Ted:,"Wait. Where are you?
"
4,11,18,Woman:,"Somewhere in Spain. I go there. Quiet song.
"
4,11,19,Ted:,"Damn. This is Barney.
"
4,11,20,Robin:,"And?
"
4,11,21,Lily:,"Since that time Heather happening in New York, Ted has never left the Barney show.
"
4,11,22,Ted:,"I never will. Every year, when the greeting card of Mosby happens...
"
4,11,23,Barney (singing):,"Drop your trousers. Mine hard. Under the bunch of mistletoe, I'll make your sister moan. Oh! Dear Heather, Heather dear, we'll do it in all directions...
"
4,11,24,Barney:,"If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. And fours.
"
4,11,25,Barney:,"Ted has a little sister who is so playful every day. And if I meet with her breasts, I will play! Little sister, Little Sister!What? I can also celebrate Hanukkah.
"
4,11,26,Ted:,"It's still him. I should answer. Hello, Barney.
"
4,11,27,Barney:,"Hi. What are you doing tonight?
"
4,11,28,Ted:,"We go to Marshall and Lily get a full Kathy Bates, Misery exception. Want to go? He hung up.
"
4,11,29,Heather:,"It's nice to see you.
"
4,11,30,Ted:,"Hi kid. It looks to go. How are things at home?
"
4,11,31,Heather:,"I took your room. Did you know you see the room of Miss Gottwald opposite?
"
4,11,32,Ted:,"I know. She looks good?
"
4,11,33,Heather:,"Ted, it was 62 years.
"
4,11,34,Ted:,"Answer.
"
4,11,35,Heather:,"Incredibly gay. (They return to the apartment) Dude, quail out there.
"
4,11,36,Barney:,"Why, hello. I was expecting you.
"
4,11,37,Ted:,"One second. It is not our chair. You've made yourself?
"
4,11,38,Barney:,"I needed one that rotates.
"
4,11,39,Ted:,"How did you know that Heather was coming?
"
4,11,40,Lily:,"Do not tell me anything! You know I can not keep secrets if it's almost Christmas! Robin offers you an iPod!
"
4,11,41,Barney:,"Can I talk to one second in the kitchen? Not touch the chair. I praise him. I can not believe that thou hast hid thy sister all these years.
"
4,11,42,Ted:,"Really? You're like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.
"
4,11,43,Barney:,"First, I'm flattered. Then it's just jokes. A friend can joke on a friend's sister. Does not mean I'm going to act.
"
4,11,44,Ted:,"I love my sister, and as a big brother, it's my job to protect guys like you.
"
4,11,45,Barney:,"You do not trust me?
"
4,11,46,Ted:,"No. And it either.
"
4,11,47,Barney:,"Okay. All right. I'll just... take my chair and leave.
"
4,11,48,Ted:,"Wait... Rest... Back... Lily and I were dining out with Heather Sunday. Want to go?
"
4,11,49,Barney:,"I have already called to add a person.
"
4,11,50,Ted:,"You really can not tell Lily.
"
4,11,51,Barney:,"No, nothing really...
"
4,11,52,Ted (2030):,"That year, Canada was really lacking in Aunt Robin, Marshall then brought him to where he was when he was nostalgic Minnesota: The bar of the Perche.
"
4,11,53,Marshall:,"Hi everyone.
"
4,11,54,All:,"Marshall!
"
4,11,55,Marshall:,"This is Robin.
"
4,11,56,All:,"Robin!
"
4,11,57,Marshall:,"Turn drink.
"
4,11,58,All:,"Drink!
"
4,11,59,Man:,"How are you, Marshall?
"
4,11,60,Marshall:,"And you? Hey, man! You got anything in the leg?
"
4,11,61,Man:,"I played hockey today. I hurt my knee.
"
4,11,62,Robin:,"You went to the hospital?
"
4,11,63,Man:,"I poured beer on it. I miss the game of the Vikings.Minnesota!
"
4,11,64,Robin:,"I love the guys here. This is real guys. Without shampoo or manicure. The guys from New York are 10% chick.
"
4,11,65,Marshall:,"Go. You're wrong.
"
4,11,66,Barney:,"I'll take the vichyssoise with a hint of cream. Dairy ballonnent me.
"
4,11,67,Heather:,"So... I found an apartment today.
"
4,11,68,Ted:,"Really?
"
4,11,69,Heather:,"Yes. And I hoped you would have drunk a little more wine hand side before you to ask you this, but... I need you to lease the instructions.
"
4,11,70,Ted:,"Let me think.
"
4,11,71,Barney:,"It, it means he will not.
"
4,11,72,Heather:,"I really need your help.
"
4,11,73,Ted:,"We'll talk later, OK?
"
4,11,74,Barney:,"You do not have any illusions.
"
4,11,75,Heather:,"What's the matter? You do not trust me?
"
4,11,76,Ted:,"You're my sister.
"
4,11,77,Barney:,"There he just says the obvious.
"
4,11,78,Heather:,"Listen, Ted, I want to get into finance, but... you see me like I was four and I wanted to become an astronaut.
"
4,11,79,Ted:,"I just think you have no idea of the difficulty of succeeding in New York.
"
4,11,80,Barney:,"Exactly. Do you need relationships. If only Ted knew someone who works at, say... Goliath National Bank, then...expect. What? I work for Goliath National Bank. Incredible!
"
4,11,81,Man:,"Okay. It's been two beers and Bemidji... who ordered the mini burgers?
"
4,11,82,Robin:,"My God! This is Fisherman's Quest? I played all the time FQ at the time!
"
4,11,83,Marshall:,"Oh, yeah? I have the best score. Without boasting, I caught... a pike of almost 1 m. The biggest fish virtual nobody has ever taken. Finally... freshwater.
"
4,11,84,Robin:,"I'll take my hat fisherman. Thank you for bringing me here. This is mine.
"
4,11,85,Ted:,"It's not a good idea. Heather and Barney alone in his office? And I do not want to be guarantor for the lease.
"
4,11,86,Lily:,"It ripens, just as you see it yet.
"
4,11,87,Ted:,"It is about a girl who got caught for stealing, eight months ago.
"
4,11,88,Lily:,"Ted, many women have a period kleptomaniac. And yes, maybe sometimes they happen to mow a small object because it excites them in a strange way they are not explained. But... If it reassures you, I will accompany them to GNB, tomorrow. I will say that I'm going to lunch with Marshall, but in fact I espionnerai.
"
4,11,89,Ted:,"It suits me. Good luck tomorrow at the GNB. I'm sure you will impress them.
"
4,11,90,Lily:,"And I espionnerai. And sh1t!
"
4,11,91,Robin:,"""I drink to forget the 1999 NFC Championship""?
"
4,11,92,Marshall:,"The match. The Vikings were 2 minutes to go to the Super Bowl, when our striker, who had not missed a year's messed up a penalty and we lost in overtime. Damn!
"
4,11,93,Male:,"1999 NFC Championship Game?
"
4,11,94,Marshall:,"Yes.
"
4,11,95,Man:,"Damn!
"
4,11,96,Marshall:,"My father, I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear. He said... ""A small part of me just died, son. ""
"
4,11,97,Robin:,"I love the passion you have for your Vikings. It's like looking for hockey in Canada... What?
"
4,11,98,Marshall:,"Do not let... anyone here know that you're not from Minnesota.
"
4,11,99,Robin:,"Why? They will do anything q'ils learn that I am...
"
4,11,100,Man 1:,"It looks like a bar in Dallas, man?
"
4,11,101,Male 2:,"It's weird, but is a reassuring side to be worn like that.
"
4,11,102,Man 3:,"Dude, did you see this guy! So, Robin, are you coming from?
"
4,11,103,Robin:,"Bemidji. Bemidji, Minnesota. Go Vikes!
"
4,11,104,Ted (2030):,"Children, for the rest, I'll skip a few days.
"
4,11,105,Heather:,"Very nice, this briefcase.
"
4,11,106,Ted:,"Very friendly, the security camera, too. And there is one another. And a security guard.
"
4,11,107,Heather:,"I intend to pay it, Ted.
"
4,11,108,Ted:,"Yes. You got the job yet. Must push the door, not pull.And that's it. Thank you for having watched yesterday. Maybe I was wrong. She seems to have been able to manage with Barney. It will perhaps manage New York.
"
4,11,109,Lily:,"Not enough!
"
4,11,110,Ted:,"Why?
"
4,11,111,Lily:,"I have a secret. No! It has not happened. It happened something.
"
4,11,112,Ted:,"It's been what?
"
4,11,113,Lily:,"Nothing. After the interview Heather, I went to see Marshall one time, when I came back...
"
4,11,114,Lily:,"My God!
"
4,11,115,Barney:,"Before you say or do something, give me a favor.
"
4,11,116,Lily:,"What?
"
4,11,117,Barney:,"Move away. It's a Prada.
"
4,11,118,Lily:,"I'm really sorry.
"
4,11,119,Ted:,"I knew it. I've always known. It remained the same trail irresponsible. And when I see Barney...
"
4,11,120,Lily:,"You will say nothing. Ted, Heather begged me not to tell you. She hate me if she knows that I sneaked.
"
4,11,121,Heather:,"I love this kit, but I can not afford. You were right, Ted.
"
4,11,122,Ted:,"And how!
"
4,11,123,Lily:,"You see? She has not bought the briefcase! It is responsible! And no chance that she slept with someone here.She turns the page.
"
4,11,124,Marshall:,"Hi everyone!
"
4,11,125,Robin:,"So my father and I were in the NFC championship game by 99.
"
4,11,126,Marshall:,"I said, good evening everyone!
"
4,11,127,Robin:,"And when we missed the penalty and lost...
"
4,11,128,All:,"Holy sh1t!
"
4,11,129,Robin:,"Holy sh1t! f*cking. My father that I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear and said, ""A small part of me just died, son. ""
"
4,11,130,Man:,"""Son""?
"
4,11,131,Robin:,"That's what I tell my son. If I am fortunate to have a son, I will call Rashad Tarkenton.
"
4,11,132,Man:,"Nice story.
"
4,11,133,Marshall:,"Beautiful story! But it seems a bit familiar.
"
4,11,134,Robin:,"I know! They all bought into.
"
4,11,135,Marshall:,"I see what you do.
"
4,11,136,Robin:,"What?
"
4,11,137,Marshall:,"I've brought here because... I was sorry for you. And there, it looks like you're trying to steal my bar.
"
4,11,138,Robin:,"You think I'm trying to steal your bar? Host.
"
4,11,139,Man:,"""Host""? Are you Canadian?
"
4,11,140,Robin:,"No, I...
"
4,11,141,Man:,"If you want to imitate a Canadian, just turn off the light and act as if you were afraid!
"
4,11,142,Robin:,"What was that?
"
4,11,143,Marshall:,"With the nearby Canada, Minnesota, we like to make jokes on your back and they are often on the same theme.
"
4,11,144,Robin:,"As fear of the dark?
"
4,11,145,Marshall:,"Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? ""What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid! ""
"
4,11,146,Robin:,"This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?
"
4,11,147,Marshall:,"Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back.
"
4,11,148,Robin:,"No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians.
"
4,11,149,Marshall:,"Please, no scene.
"
4,11,150,Robin:,"Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place!
"
4,11,151,Barney:,"I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position.
"
4,11,152,Lily:,"This is the new coasters?
"
4,11,153,Barney:,"I hope you get the job. Nothing makes me happier than to fill an opening.
"
4,11,154,Lily:,"I swear, these coasters are thicker.
"
4,11,155,Heather:,"I'm ready to bend over backwards.
"
4,11,156,Ted:,"OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!
"
4,11,157,Barney:,"You've sneaked?
"
4,11,158,Lily:,"You know what? It's a new batch of old coasters. I will confirm with the bartender.
"
4,11,159,Ted (holding Lily):,"And you, you're mature and responsible?It's responsible adult to go to your first interview in New York and banging a stranger? You've always been immature and irresponsible. You'll always be immature and irresponsible.And I cosignerai not a subscription with you, let alone a lease.
"
4,11,160,Heather:,"Barney and I, we did nothing.
"
4,11,161,Ted:,"Come on. Lily saw you.
"
4,11,162,Barney:,"Oh yeah?
"
4,11,163,Barney:,"You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather...
"
4,11,164,Heather:,".. That we decided to show you what you expect from us.
"
4,11,165,Barney:,"And as we can count on Lily to sneak.
"
4,11,166,Lily:,"My God!
"
4,11,167,Ted:,"What? Why do this?
"
4,11,168,Heather:,"Because you deserve it.
"
4,11,169,Barney:,"Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe.
"
4,11,170,Heather:,"You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas.
"
4,11,171,Barney:,"Your mother and I, we kissed.
"
4,11,172,Man 1:,"Continuous. You got five seconds to catch sturgeon still 2.
"
4,11,173,Man 2:,"We will perhaps see the screen of the gills.
"
4,11,174,Marshall:,"You can catch two fish with a hook.
"
4,11,175,Robin:,"No, but I can catch a fish and use this one to catch the other.
"
4,11,176,Man 1:,"High Scores! You got beat Marshall!
"
4,11,177,Marshall:,"It is Canadian! Robin is Canadian! She is Canadian.It comes not from Bemidji and she knows bugger all about the Vikings.
"
4,11,178,Man 1:,"You're angry because she beat you.
"
4,11,179,Marshall:,"During the 1999 NFC Championship, when the Vikings lost...
"
4,11,180,All:,"Holy sh1t!
"
4,11,181,Marshall:,".. who was the scorer who missed the penalty?
"
4,11,182,Robin:,"Rashad Tarkenton.
"
4,11,183,Marshall:,"Gary Anderson. He is retired. It was a case of fly fishing... in Canada.
"
4,11,184,Man 1:,"Goodbye.
"
4,11,185,Robin:,"You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the ""Great White North""... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else.
"
4,11,186,Ted:,"Merry Christmas. Look into it. If you push around the...Not down the middle.
"
4,11,187,Heather:,"I do not need you.
"
4,11,188,Ted:,"Got it.
"
4,11,189,Heather:,"You've signed the lease.
"
4,11,190,Ted:,"You know why?
"
4,11,191,Heather:,"Because you trust me and that's a good idea?
"
4,11,192,Ted:,"I want to know you. The new you.
"
4,11,193,Heather:,"Thank you.
"
4,11,194,Ted:,"By the way, in your new neighborhood, you should put a good lock on your door. If you want... live.
"
4,11,195,Marshall:,"Sorry about what happened inside. I was stupid. I should say anything.
"
4,11,196,Robin:,"I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing.
"
4,11,197,Marshall:,"But if.
"
4,11,198,Robin:,"What?
"
4,11,199,Marshall:,"We love you all. If you ever leave again in Canada, we jump on a plane, you are pursuing, and after that Barney has dragged some of the club with which you have spoken, we will bring you here where you are supposed to be. This is not New York without Robin Scherbatsky.
"
4,11,200,Robin:,"Thank you.
"
4,11,201,Marshall:,"Yeah.
"
4,11,202,Robin:,"I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada.
"
4,11,203,Marshall:,"I was hoping that you say that.
"
4,11,204,Robin:,"How did you find this place?
"
4,11,205,Marshall:,"Just like home, eh?
"
4,11,206,Robin:,"There's only one way to know.
"
4,11,207,Man:,"Sorry. I had not seen. Are you okay?
"
4,11,208,Robin:,"It's OK.
"
4,11,209,Man:,"OK, I apologize. Take a donut, it's a gift.
"
4,11,210,Robin:,"thank you.
"
4,11,211,Marshall:,"OK. You come home in him, he apologized and you file a donut free?
"
4,11,212,Robin:,"It's like home.
"
4,11,213,Marshall:,"Sorry! All is well! Sorry.
"
4,11,214,Robin:,"No one likes the dark.
"
4,11,215,Man (speaking):,"The following comes from Ontario: Marshall Eriksen.
"
4,11,216,Robin:,"You were a member? You sing what?
"
4,11,217,Marshall:,"I think you will recognize. I will throw your body anyway. I will throw your body into Canada Day! Dude, you can split the screen. We know the words.
"
4,11,218,All:,"Everyone comes to play. Take all your worries. (Robin puts on a mask) Let's go to the mall. Today!
