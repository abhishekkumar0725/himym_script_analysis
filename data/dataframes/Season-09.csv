"

"
9,20,11,MARSHALL,"Captain, I know something happened between you and Lily last night.
"
9,20,12,MARSHALL,"All right, Captain. What the hell happened here last night?
"
9,20,13,(choked up),"Hi, I-I know it's late, but I've got to get out of here.
"
9,20,14,CAPTAIN,"So I sent the car. When she got here...
"
9,20,15,CAPTAIN,"And when she came out, she had to leave right away.
"
9,20,16,LILY,"I can keep a secret.
"
9,20,17,TED,"Why?
"
9,20,18,(laughing),"Oh, Barney, my dear boy.
"
9,20,19,TED,"Lily knew that cigarette was probably her last for a while.

"
9,20,21,Only problem,"she was all out.
"
9,20,22,"Now, it's 3","0 a.m., you need a cigarette, and the only place that's open is an EZ Pick that's five miles down the road.
"
9,20,23,TED,"The problem was, Lily didn't want to smoke in front of her new employer.
"
9,20,24,TED,"Now, you're Lily.
"
9,8,1,NARRATOR,"Kids, Barney's mom had this blouse that she absolutely loved, but then Robin won it in a poker game, which led to some slight awkwardness.
"
9,8,2,BARNEY,"Please, Mom, I need you to just be cool.
"
9,8,3,NARRATOR,"Kids, not far from the Farhampton Inn, there's a lighthouse.
"
9,8,4,NARRATOR,"Now, late the night before, thanks to Marshall's travel companion, Daphne, Lily had received some unsettling news.
"
9,8,5,NARRATOR,"Screwing up their whole plan to move to Italy.
"
9,8,6,NARRATOR,"As for Marshall and Daphne, they got caught in that big storm.
"
9,8,7,CLINT,"You know what I'm talking about, don't you, Marshall?
"
9,8,8,BARNEY,"Actually, that's exactly what she is.
"
9,8,9,NARRATOR,"Kids, we've known your Aunt Robin for eight years at that point, and here's what we knew about her mom.
"
9,8,10,NARRATOR,"And... that's everything.
"
9,8,11,(whispering),"Get out of this now.
"
9,8,12,BARNEY,"Aw.
"
9,8,13,NARRATOR,"Cassie was the girl I'd spent the entire previous night consoling.
"
9,8,14,NARRATOR,"And then, in her anger, Lily gave me a piece of advice about which she would later say...
"
9,8,15,NARRATOR,"And so I made up my mind to settle for Cassie.
"
9,8,16,NARRATOR,"Still, I felt optimistic.
"
9,8,17,Remember,"happy wife, happy life.
"
9,8,18,(laughing),"Oh, I don't think I should...

"
9,8,23,(strained),"Oh, my God. One more.
"
9,8,24,NARRATOR,"And, kids, as I stood on that lighthouse and looked at that girl, I felt something happen inside me, something that had only happened one other time in my entire adult life.
"
9,8,25,ROBIN,"Okay, scrambled eggs.
"
9,8,26,DAPHNE,"This is ridiculous.
"
9,8,27,LILY,"Oh, mama, that was some bad advice.
"
9,8,28,NARRATOR,"And that, kids, is the kind of stupid thing you say before you've met the person who hits the reset button on the world, who makes everything new again, who makes it seem ridiculous that you ever considered settling, because not two years later...
"
9,9,1,TED,"I can't believe your mom's not coming to the wedding?
"
9,9,2,NARRATOR,"Diapers and Samosas. Oh, that's about something that happened six months earlier in the fall of 2012.
"
9,9,3,BOTH,"Major craving for a mojito.
"
9,9,4,Symposium,"two people are only platonic if in the next 20 minutes there is no chance of them hooking up.

"
9,9,9,Ryan? ROBIN,"No.
"
9,9,10,HAMMOND DRUTHERS,"Ted?
"
9,9,11,NARRATOR,"And that's how Barney met your mother.

9,21,1,TED,"Hi.
"
9,21,2,(laughs),"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"
9,21,3,(whispers),"I got you.
"
9,21,4,Here's the deal,"you get to tell us one more interesting fact about Teddy Roosevelt.
"
9,21,5,TED,"Well, one night, we were throwing a party to celebrate... something--
"
9,21,6,ALL,"...the archetype of the modern politician!
"
9,21,7,TED,"Dude, knock it off.
"
9,21,8,GARY,"Knock what off, bro?
"
9,21,9,TED,"And so the standoff continued, hours passed... then days.
"
9,21,10,LILY,"Did you just say Gary Blauman?
"
9,21,11,Here's the part that still keeps me up at night,"the fourth fry he took...

"
9,21,13,MARSHALL,"You take a man's wife before you take his accidental curly.

"
9,21,19,NARRATOR,"And that's how it goes, kids.
"
9,21,20,ROBIN (over phone),"Because sometimes I just feel like he never listens to me, you know?
"
9,21,21,ROBIN,"Damn it, Patrice, I'm not finished!
"

"
9,23,12,BARNEY,"A hot air balloon?

9,10,15,DAPHNE,"Wait, this isn't...
"
9,10,16,AUDIENCE (chanting),"Drill, baby, drill! We should go.
"
9,10,17,"""So to summarize","""I'm super dead, ""you should totally bone Loretta, ""and I never loved you, Cheryl,"" which is misspelled.
"
9,10,18,WOMAN,"Hello? Mom?
"
9,10,19,NARRATOR,"And for an all too rare moment that weekend, everything was all right.
"
9,10,20,BARNEY,"Yes! Go for it.
"
9,4,1,NARRATOR,"Kids, it was two days before Barney and Robin's wedding, and everything was going off without a hitch.
"
9,4,2,TED,"Ah.
"
9,4,3,BARNEY,"She called me to help her, and there you were in the rain holding hands with my fiancée.
"
9,4,4,(crying),"Oh, my God.
"
9,4,5,ROBIN,"Oh, who's that for?
"
9,4,6,NARRATOR,"Kids, as you may recall, whenever Marshall left town for a few days, Lily would compensate with a body pillow she dressed up and named Marshpillow.
"
9,4,7,MARSHALL,"Hey, Ted.
"
9,4,8,(high-pitched),"What?
"
9,4,9,(quietly),"Billy Zabka's your new best man?
"
9,4,10,(quietly),"Oh, God, I'm gonna strangle that bitch.
"
9,4,11,Article one,"bros before ho's.
"
9,4,12,TED,"Okay.
"
9,4,13,Article 62,"a bro who calls dibs first has dibs.
"
9,4,14,"""Article 104","the mom of a bro is always off limits.""
"
9,4,15,(whispering),"That's how our bodies were intertwined.
"
9,4,16,It's after 5,"0. Put on some heels.
"
9,4,17,MARSHALL,"Now, although not expressly stated in the Bro Code, a weird moment between a bro and his bro's fiancée is, in my bropinion... a violation.
"
9,4,18,BARNEY,"Marshall, why are we doing this?!
"
9,4,19,BOTH,"I hate the Boston Bruins!
"
9,4,20,NARRATOR,"As she watched Robin make a new friend, Lily was happy... for two seconds.
"
9,4,21,BOTH,"...in no way jeopardizes our emotional connection, or respective marriages?!
"
9,4,22,LILY,"Aw!
"
9,4,23,BARNEY,"Oh.
"
9,4,24,"All right, all right. ALL","Oh!
"
9,4,25,NARRATOR,"And that's how I became Barney's best man again.
"
9,4,26,NARRATOR,"Okay, there was one slight hitch.
"
9,5,1,NARRATOR,"Barney's bachelor poker game was winding down.
"
9,5,2,NARRATOR,"Kids, there's a story behind that face.
"
9,5,3,NARRATOR,"But time passed, and no gift arrived.
"
9,5,4,NARRATOR,"But I didn't get it.
"
9,5,5,NARRATOR,"But he kept on waiting until the summer of 2008 when I got engaged.
"
9,5,6,NARRATOR,"And not long after that, a package arrived.
"
9,5,7,NARRATOR,"Which explains the face.
"
9,5,8,JAMES,"Hey, Barney.
"
9,5,9,(in deep voice),"Don't get married!
"
9,5,10,(in high-pitched voice),"Don't get married!
"
9,5,11,BARNEY,"Ah.
"
9,5,12,ALL,"Ooh!
"
9,5,13,MARSHALL,"You, Ted Mosby, never got me and Lily a wedding gift!
"
9,5,14,I'm gonna tell you what I told Frampton's guitar tech when he couldn't find a condom,"let's gamble.
"
9,5,15,NARRATOR,"No thank you note.
"
9,5,16,NARRATOR,"And she did.
"
9,5,17,Remember,"happy wife equals happy life.
"
9,5,18,We even have an expression,"""Wrap it before you tap it.""
"
9,5,19,Robin? Two things,"number one, are you dropping heat right now?
"
9,5,20,Step one,"you let my mom win the ring back in a hand of poker.
"
9,5,21,"James, let me spell this out for you","now that I've got Robin, we are not brothers anymore.
"
9,5,22,MARSHALL,"Ted, I'm so sorry!
"
9,5,23,NARRATOR,"And, kids, I got that thank you note four months later.
"
9,11,1,NARRATOR,"Marshall and Marvin were taking the bus on their way to Long Island to meet up with us.
"
9,11,2,"Why, Marvin... MARSHALL","She noted.
"
9,11,3,She asked timidly. He answered,
9,11,4,TED,"Psh, yeah, 'cause physics is so interesting.
"
9,11,5,ALL,"Hooray! MARSHALL: We cheered.
"
9,11,6,MARSHALL,"Ted thought back on past failed dates.
"
9,11,7,MARSHALL,"And then, as Barney made some gestures that were rather rude, Ted left to go meet Lisa, in a rather puzzled mood.
"
9,11,8,TED,"Mariano Rivera?
"
9,11,9,MARSHALL,"And as she said...
"
9,11,10,All Ted could bring himself to think was,
9,11,11,TED,"Alfonso Soriano?
"
9,11,12,TED,"Is it Joe Girardi?
"
9,11,13,MARSHALL,"As Ted looked at that cell phone pic, there were two things he reckoned.
"
9,11,14,NARRATOR,"I guess he had a point.
"
9,11,15,MAN,"Hey, Robin, how's it going?
"
9,11,16,MARSHALL,"He'd always been a deadbeat and your classic hoser phony, but seeing Simon all cleaned up hit Robin like a Zamboni.
"
9,11,17,"And as she tried to stammer some excuse to get away, Simon said",
9,11,18,MARSHALL,"Once more into the breach she surged, as Ted and Mommy cheered and bite by bite the towering confection disappeared.
"
9,11,19,Yeah. MARSHALL,"Mom's exhortations rang like Apollo coaching Rocky 'gainst a frosted Clubber Lang.
"
9,11,20,"Hey, this is like that scene from Cool Hand Luke. You know, (Southern accent)","""My boy can eat 50 eggs "" Right?
"
9,11,21,MARSHALL,"And now that night's remembered not for Robin getting dumped but as the night we took her in to get her stomach pumped.
"
9,11,22,At least we know one thing for sure,"things can't get worse, I swear.
"
9,11,23,"As Barney put it, oh so eloquently",
9,11,24,He rose to go approach this girl commanding such intrigue when Mommy interrupted,
9,11,25,So many great things 'bout this girl,"her boobs, her rack, her chest.
"
9,11,26,"As I departed, having bid this busty babe buh-bye, I stopped and looked around, and wondered",
9,11,27,"The sign read 22nd Street, and my concern decreased until a cold wind blew a branch aside, revealing","""East.""
"
9,11,28,BARNEY,"No! Not fair.
"
9,11,29,And such a better dresser. TED,"Sorry, dude, but that's revenge for Lisa the professor.
"
9,11,30,Yes. MARSHALL,"Your mommy said.
"
9,11,31,BUS DRIVER,"Sorry, folks, flat tire.
"
9,11,32,NARRATOR,"And that, kids, is the very first thing your cousin Marvin remembers.
"
9,11,33,NARRATOR,"Then Marshall looked up heavenward, and swore by night's first star five simple words he'd soon regret:
