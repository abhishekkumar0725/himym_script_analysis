"
7,20,3,"Last night, I had just come back from my 8","0 fart.
"
7,20,4,Just one little thing,"would it be okay if instead of using your coffee mugs, we use mine?
"
7,20,5,Narrator,"Kids, here's the deal with trilogy time:
"

"
7,20,7,Narrator,"We both got zeroes.
"
7,20,8,Barney,"Oh, really, Marshall? Nothing comes to mind?
"

"

"
7,20,11,(whispering),"Get me out of this thing!
"
7,20,12,Marshall,"Okay, that is so weird.
"
7,20,13,"Anyway, while it's just us guys, let me ask you something","we've all had that same fantasy about having s*x with a girl in a stormtrooper costume, right?
"
7,20,14,(laughing),"something is seriously wrong with me!
"

"

"
7,8,7,It's me,"you at age 15.
"
7,8,8,"I don't feel intimate with her. ""Intimate""? Let me remind you of some things you did feel ""intimate"" with when you were 15","a catcher's mitt, an oven mitt, a glass of warm water, a half-open hide-a-bed sofa, a top-loading VCR!
"
7,8,9,All,"Yes!
"
7,8,10,Narrator,"I knew it would be tough to break up with Naomi.
"
7,8,11,Ted,"Stay strong, Teddy. We can do this.
"
7,8,12,Barney,"I'll be right there.
"
7,8,13,(whispering),"Canada.
"
7,8,14,(sobbing),"I'm going to miss that stapler so much.
"
7,8,15,Kid,"That's for the stapler!
"
7,8,16,Naomi,"Why won't he stop sniffing my hair?

7,21,2,(moaning),"Oh, yeah.
"
7,21,3,Can only mean one thing,"Lily dream-banged someone we know.
"
7,21,4,Narrator,"And, kids, they did make it.

"
7,21,23,"Every night, between 9","0 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., I'm in hell.
"
7,21,24,Narrator,"Later that night...
"
7,23,1,Narrator,"Kids, when Aunt Lily went into labor, Marshall was somewhere slightly inconvenient, in Atlantic City with Uncle Barney, and drunk to the point of talking like Yoda.

7,23,3,Narrator,"Kids, for the life of me, I can't remember what the big thing was in Atlantic City that weekend.

"
7,23,9,Robin,"Ted came out of that bathroom looking like Joe Frazier after the Thrilla in Manila.
"
7,23,10,Robin,"But then...
"
7,23,11,(grunting),"Just keep going with the stories.
"
7,23,12,Lily,"When I was seven, I needed to have my tonsils out.

"
7,23,18,Narrator,"Now, Marshall was pretty drunk, but he swears the ATM started to do this.

"
7,23,21,(à la Schwarzenegger),"Come with me if you want to bang.
"
7,23,22,ROBIN and MARSHALL,"Whoa.
"
7,23,23,Narrator,"Kids, sometimes the universe sends exactly what you ask for.
"
7,23,24,(groaning),"Oh...
"
7,23,25,Narrator,"And then, something wonderful happened.
"
7,23,26,Man,"So is mine!
"
7,23,27,All,"We know!
"
7,23,28,(panting),"I'm here, baby.

"
7,22,7,Narrator,"That night, I went out with the first girl Barney picked for me.
"
7,22,8,Narrator,"And just like that, Robyn became Robin.
"
7,22,9,Narrator,"With that, an argument began,
"
7,22,10,"For instance, Uncle Marshall swears he never said",
7,22,11,And he claims he never actually uttered the words,
7,22,12,While Lily insists this part was exaggerated,
7,22,13,But everyone agrees this is how the argument ended,
7,22,14,(angry grunt),"Huh!
"
7,22,15,Narrator,"The next day, I filled Barney in on my date.
"
7,22,16,The next girl,"perfect palate cleanser.

"
7,19,4,Lily,"Marshall, you can't tell s*x stories about ""this chick,"" because everyone knows it's me.
"
7,19,5,"So, when we walk back through that door three hours from now, we should all be able to answer one simple question","Do we trust this girl?

7,19,6,Narrator,"Kids, things have been tense between Robin and I for weeks.
"
7,19,7,It's 10,"0, damn it.

7,19,9,Narrator,"So, when Quinn said her apartment was available...
"
7,19,10,ROBIN/TED,"It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!
"
7,19,11,Robin,"First-class tickets, a four-star hotel--
"
7,19,12,All,"Yup.
"
7,19,13,Narrator,"Kids, as you'll recall, our gang had a subtle way of letting someone know they were making a mistake.
"
7,19,14,"Okay, I'll just say it","After everything that happened between us, I can't believe you wouldn't back down and let me have Quinn's place.
"
7,19,15,And now my boss wants to see me Friday at 5,"0, which, around the office, is known as ""fire o'clock.""
"
7,19,16,Others,"""I, one of Barney's best friends...""
"
7,19,17,QUINN,"Hot stuff, fellas.
"
7,19,18,Barney,"I'll make Ted swear not to tell anyone what he knows about you, and he'll cave immediately.
"
7,19,19,I'll keep saying stuff like,
7,19,20,QUINN,"And I'll be the bossy bitch who says:
"
7,19,21,Barney,"Nice.
"
7,19,22,"Wait for it. Next, BARNEY","they'll try to talk me into dumping you.
"
7,19,23,QUINN,"And I'll walk in on it.
"
7,19,24,Barney,"Then we pretend to break up.
"
7,19,25,QUINN,"Or make the monkeys dance for you.
"
7,19,26,Barney,"God, you're smart!
"
7,19,27,Narrator,"And that's the story of how we met Quinn.
"
7,19,28,Ted,"That Friday, I met Robin to see how it went at ""fire o'clock.""
"
7,19,29,(laughing),"Apparently.
"
7,19,30,Narrator,"We wouldn't see each other for a long time.
"
7,24,1,All,"Boo!
"
7,24,2,Narrator,"Which brings us to the story of a wedding day that went horribly wrong.

7,24,3,"Because as your friend, I have to tell you","You're full of crap!
"
7,24,4,"Look at the women you date, starting with me","I told you right away I didn't want marriage or kids.
"
7,24,5,Ted,"Victoria was great.
"
7,24,6,Narrator,"Lily and Marshall asked Robin to be the photographer for Baby Marvin's Birth Announcement card instead of me.
"
7,24,7,"See, two different styles","I make compositions, Robin makes excuses.
"
7,24,8,Narrator,"And kids, as I watched your Aunt Lily hold her baby boy, another thought popped into my head.
"
7,24,9,Narrator,"That girl's a mom!
"
7,24,10,"Ted, we are responsible for a whole other human life now, so new rule","You can't come to us with any issue unless it's an ""8"" or higher.
"
7,24,11,This is the same as what's in little Marvin's pants right now,"a soft two.
"
7,24,12,Narrator,"And then another thought popped
"
7,24,13,into my head,"That guy's nowhere near being a dad.
"
7,24,14,VICTORIA,"Hello?
"
7,24,15,MacLaren's at 2,"0?
"
7,24,16,Is 1,"0 okay?
"
7,24,17,Narrator,"Meanwhile, Barney and Quinn were off to Hawaii for their first getaway as a couple.
"
7,24,18,(sighing),"It's mine.
"
7,24,19,(laughing),"Oh, I can't do that.
"
7,24,20,Ted,"Okay, I need to figure out if Victoria ever got engaged.
"
7,24,21,Loretta,"Wayne, come back to bed!
"
7,24,22,MRS. MATSEN,"I told you he wasn't gay.
"
7,24,23,Narrator,"That's Barney's version.
"
7,24,24,(gasps),"Ta-da... da-da-da-da-da-da.
"
7,24,25,One question,"FDR or Westside Highway, what's the quickest way to the sunset?
"
7,24,26,"Sir, I'll tell you her occupation","stripper.
"
7,24,27,(loudly),"Will you marry me?
"
7,24,28,Narrator,"I hate to say it, but Robin nailed it.
"
7,24,29,QUINN,"Once up on a time, this creepy magic dude was boning Barney's mom...
"
7,18,1,Narrator,"Kids, 2012 started out kind of crazy.
"
7,18,2,EMCEE,"Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
"
7,18,3,Narrator,"When Robin moved out, there was a hole in my life in the shape of an empty bedroom.
"
7,18,4,(quietly),"Or never.
"
7,18,5,It's 8,"5, time to hit the hay.
"
7,18,6,Lily,"Good night!
"
7,18,7,"I liked smoking meat, but now I've got a new passion","wood.
"
7,18,8,Robin,"Dear Diary.
"
7,18,9,(whispers),"People were staring.
"
7,18,10,Robin,"They're trying to make me one of them, Diary.
"
7,18,11,(chuckling),"Bunch of losers!
"
7,18,12,Narrator,"The next morning, Barney learned that even in
"
7,18,13,Ted,"Dear Lily and Marshall, I don't know if you know this, but I never took your names off the lease.
"
7,15,1,"Yeah. Marshall's been working very long hours lately, so I have been planning this whole party by myself, and everything's in place","the food, the wine.
"
7,15,2,Bottom line,"this party is very important to me, so I can only assume--
"
7,15,3,Ted,"Why would you even say that?! It's the most ridic...
"
7,15,4,Both,"Happy housewarming!
"
7,15,5,Narrator,"So that's what happened in the living room.
"
7,15,6,Narrator,"And that's what happened in the dining room.
"
7,15,7,Barney,"Man, I can't believe these are vegan.
"
7,1,1,Ted (2030),"Children, if there is a major theme in this story, and I swear, it's almost, really, not quite at the end of the story.This is timing. The timing makes all the difference. For example, I never met your mother if it was not for a wedding.The last of the weddings that I thought would be.
"
7,1,2,Barney,"What do you think of this tie?
"
7,1,3,Ted,"Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?
"
7,1,4,Barney,"This one is better?
"
7,1,5,Ted,"The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.
"
7,1,6,Barney,"I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?
"
7,1,7,Ted,"Yeah, sure.
"
7,1,8,Barney,"I do not really talk about the tie.
"
7,1,9,Ted,"Yeah, I realized that Barney.
"
7,1,10,Barney,"I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?
"
7,1,11,Ted,"Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.
"
7,1,12,Barney,"That of Punchy.
"
7,1,13,Ted,"Marshall has really ruined all that.
"
7,1,14,Ted (2030),"The story of Uncle Marshall has ruined everything in my friend's wedding Punchy starts in September 2011.
"
7,1,15,Ted (2030),"Punchy asked me to be his witness.
"
7,1,16,Ted,"Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?
"
7,1,17,Barney,"Yeah, no problem, of course.
"
7,1,18,Ted,"Ok
"
7,1,19,Barney,"Woow.
"
7,1,20,Ted,"There are several different versions.
"
7,1,21,Robin,"Ted, why you work so hard on this speech? Punchy has applied with a karaoke microphone in a bowling alley.
"
7,1,22,Ted,"Ok, I have never said that, but over the years, some of my friends from high school asked me to give speeches at their weddings, and they have not gone well.
"
7,1,23,Ted,"These marriages have become associated as the worst moment of my life. The love between Joel and Mora is magnificent. I thought I had the same thing... Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle. (In 2009...) After losing my job last week, I asked not to give this toast... (A man tries to take her microphone) No, no, no! The happy couple should hear. It's over. But from the ashes of your divorce statistically probable, hope can be reborn. That is why I opened my own architectural firm Mosbius Designs. (3 months later...) Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!
"
7,1,24,Punchy,"A Schmosby classic.
"
7,1,25,Robin,"Wow. Punchy has posted weaknesses of your life?
"
7,1,26,Ted,"Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.
"
7,1,27,Barney,"Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland.
"
7,1,28,Ted (2030),"This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.
"
7,1,29,Barney,"Here's your speech. ""In single file, girls. No big. ""
"
7,1,30,Ted,"This is ridiculous.
"
7,1,31,Barney,"Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. ""In single file, girls. ""
"
7,1,32,Ted,"I will not Punchy's wedding to brag... cover of a magazine.
"
7,1,33,Robin,"Barney, he did not need your advice. You never called Nora.
"
7,1,34,Ted (2030),"Children, you remember Nora. But the other day...
"
7,1,35,Barney,"I'll call you.
"
7,1,36,Nora,"It's never too late, Barney.
"
7,1,37,Robin,"Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?
"
7,1,38,Barney,"I did not call.
"
7,1,39,Robin,"Slim, Barney. I was really, really, really for both of you.Who wants chicken wings?
"
7,1,40,Lily,"Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.
"
7,1,41,Barney,"I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings.
"
7,1,42,Lily,"Cannibal.
"
7,1,43,Robin,"Ok, next tour for me.
"
7,1,44,Marshall,"Oh no, no, it does that.
"
7,1,45,Ted (2030),"Lily and Marshall had just heard that they have a baby.
"
7,1,46,Marshall,"I can not wait to tell everyone.
"
7,1,47,Lily,"Baby, no one can tell anyone. Not before three months. I do not want you to have bad luck.
"
7,1,48,Marshall,"It's a bit superstitious, do not you think?
"
7,1,49,Lily,"Whenever you take a plane, you lick.
"
7,1,50,Marshall,"Has it been crashed once?
"
7,1,51,Lily,"Do not say a word until we know that all is well. Ok?
"
7,1,52,Marshall,"Ok, so everything will be okay. Promised.
"
7,1,53,Lily,"How can you guarantee that?
"
7,1,54,"Marshall, lifting the shirt of Lily","Come here.
"
7,1,55,Marshall,"I'm so happy. I do not know how we will keep this secret for three months.
"
7,1,56,Lily,"Relax. It will be easy.
"
7,1,57,Bartender,"What'll it be?
"
7,1,58,Lily,"Four beer, plus a non-alcoholic.
"
7,1,59,Bartender,"You're pregnant! Come here!
"
7,1,60,Ted (2030),"So we all went to my hometown where we had planned to celebrate the marriage of Punchy. Uncle Barney had other plans.
"
7,1,61,Barney,"Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.
"
7,1,62,Robin,"You're going to try to make you anybody here?
"
7,1,63,Barney,"What?
"
7,1,64,Robin,"My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.
"
7,1,65,Barney,"It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%...
"
7,1,66,Ted,"17. He always reverse.
"
7,1,67,Barney,".. never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?
"
7,1,68,All,"No, no.
"
7,1,69,Barney,"We'll never know unless I try tonight.
"
7,1,70,Punchy,"Schmosby! Oh! sh1t head! What's up?!
"
7,1,71,Marshall,"You really feel this ring now.
"
7,1,72,Kelly,"Glad you all here.
"
7,1,73,Punchy,"Open Bar. Bottoms up, sh1t head, because it is the father of Kelly who pays, and he hates me.
"
7,1,74,Kelly,"It's true.
"
7,1,75,Punchy,"Who drinks? Go, go.
"
7,1,76,Lily,"Oh, no, thank you.
"
7,1,77,Punchy,"You're pregnant or what?
"
7,1,78,Lily,"Let's be crazy! You're going to drink for two tonight, baby.
"
7,1,79,Marshall,"I'll do it for the child.
"
7,1,80,Kelly and Punchy,"Go Browns!
"
7,1,81,Marshall,"During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.
"
7,1,82,Barney,"Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero.
"
7,1,83,Robin,"Lily, you go getting drunk tonight.
"
7,1,84,Lily,"That's all you, baby.
"
7,1,85,Marshall,"I'd to 4 glasses without eating.
"
7,1,86,Lily,"In nine months I would push a baby Eriksen with a pumpkin head out of my hoo-haa. I think Dad can handle a few cocktails and more.
"
7,1,87,Marshall,"Well done.
"
7,1,88,Lily,"Hakuna Matata!
"
7,1,89,Marshall,"I gotta go get some air.
"
7,1,90,Ted (2030),"Children, do you remember when I told you that Marshall has ruined the marriage of Punchy? (Marshall is close to the cake) It was not that.
"
7,1,91,Robin,"My God, have you seen this guy. I want Barney is my new boyfriend. No, thank you.
"
7,1,92,Lily,"Wait a minute. It's your voice of truth.
"
7,1,93,Robin,"My what?
"
7,1,94,Lily,"Whenever you try to pretend that you're kidding but in fact it is profoundly true, you are using that voice.
"
7,1,95,Robin,"I would like the Spice Girls back together. They were awesome. The worst. (At the bar...) It was me. I farted. It is this type. (At Ted's apartment...) birthday gift from my father. All I want from him is that he tells me he loves me. Just kidding.This pen is sufficient. It's enough. It is completely sufficient.
"
7,1,96,Lily,"Oh, my God. You always have feelings for Barney. Admit it, you still have feelings for Barney.
"
7,1,97,Robin,"You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type.
"
7,1,98,Barney,"Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you? (He shows her nails, very long and the girl goes away) Sea...
"
7,1,99,Man,"Eager to hear your toast, Schmosby.
"
7,1,100,Punchy,"Yeah, here is the whiner.
"
7,1,101,Ted,"Wait. You encourage me to cry at your own wedding?
"
7,1,102,Punchy,"Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos.
"
7,1,103,Barney,"Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that.
"
7,1,104,Ted,"I've told you, I'm not here to brag, ok?
"
7,1,105,Marshall,"That's it. You're too polite to brag. Well, fine. Let me do it. Because the only person on Earth who loves more than Ted Mosby Marshall Eriksen Marshall Eriksen is drunk. So here we go.
"
7,1,106,Ted (2030),"Children, do you remember when I see have said that Marshall would ruin the marriage of Punchy and Kelly? It was not that either.
"
7,1,107,Robin,"Barney and I have tried and failed. It was there two years. Why would I start? It would not make sense.
"
7,1,108,Lily,"It does not make sense. It's chemistry. Listen, I always them a sixth sense for these things. And now that I'm pregnant... deep in me in my uterus, I see things more clearly. You and Barney have that kind of chemistry that is still there.
"
7,1,109,Robin,"Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?
"
7,1,110,Barney,"It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?
"
7,1,111,Lily,"You're the reason why he never called Nora. You're the reason why he only tests tonight. And you're the reason why he continues to try to impress. Chemistry.
"
7,1,112,Marshall,"Wow! Ted! It's really you on the cover of New York.Now, you say ""yes.""
"
7,1,113,Ted,"Stop please.
"
7,1,114,Man,"Schmosby. What is this magazine?
"
7,1,115,Ted,"You know what, Clay? It's nothing.
"
7,1,116,Marshall,"You know what? This is not nothing. Clay, my friend Ted has designed a building, Clay. What do you do, Clay?
"
7,1,117,Clay,"Well, I'm still working in the rental car...
"
7,1,118,Marshall,"Hear, hear, Clay. No major publication does write about your small agency?
"
7,1,119,Clay,"No, no, no items. My life is monotonous. I think the only news is that little thing.
"
7,1,120,Marshall,"Oh my God, look at this little baby. She's so cute. All I want is to put her little feet in my mouth. You have created something really beautiful.
"
7,1,121,Clay,"It's all for me.
"
7,1,122,Ted,"I mean, it's still huge... The building, you know?
"
7,1,123,Marshall,"Hey, kid. (With another couple and their child...) So this little angel is already every night?
"
7,1,124,Ted,"I spent many sleepless nights... to design this building.(The baby makes a return to the magazine) Nothing symbolism there.
"
7,1,125,Robin,"Forget it. There is no chemistry between Barney and me. It's over.
"
7,1,126,Lily,"Oh really? Prove it. Go talk to him.
"
7,1,127,Robin,"Why should I tell him about that?
"
7,1,128,Lily,"Because in the depths of himself, even if he does not know yet, Barney wants to be with you. And if it does not happen, he deserves to know.
"
7,1,129,Robin,"Well. Barney, just to make things clear...
"
7,1,130,Barney,"I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes.
"
7,1,131,Robin,"Barney... I...
"
7,1,132,Barney,"Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.
"
7,1,133,Robin,"Wait, you said you'd never recalled.
"
7,1,134,Barney,"I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair.
"
7,1,135,Robin,"Yeah.
"
7,1,136,Barney,"Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling...
"
7,1,137,Robin,"To tell you how I feel.
"
7,1,138,Barney,"To tell you how I feel.
"
7,1,139,Robin,"I know it did not work the first time...
"
7,1,140,Barney,"I know it did not work the first time...
"
7,1,141,Robin,".. and it makes no sense...
"
7,1,142,Barney,".. and it makes no sense...
"
7,1,143,Robin,".. but I can not help thinking that goes well together.
"
7,1,144,Barney,".. but I can not help thinking that goes well together.
"
7,1,145,Robin,"Is there a part of you that wants to try again?
"
7,1,146,Barney,"Is there a part of you that wants to try again?
"
7,1,147,Marshall,"Baby, I can not do that. I have to tell someone that we are pregnant.
"
7,1,148,Lily,"Eriksen, be strong. Keep it a secret.
"
7,1,149,Marshall,"There are babies everywhere. It's minefield of sweetness. Look at this little b*st*rd.
"
7,1,150,Lily,"Marshall, stop that. Remains strong. Can not you let me hold a little baby with his little cheeks... so cute... and little arms and little legs... This little b*st*rd has dimples. We will tell everyone I'm pregnant.
"
7,1,151,Marshall,"Yeah!
"
7,1,152,Ted,"Are you okay?
"
7,1,153,Robin,"No. And you?
"
7,1,154,Ted,"Not really. Want to talk?
"
7,1,155,Robin,"Not even a little bit.
"
7,1,156,Ted,"It might help you feel better.
"
7,1,157,Robin,"Okay, well, we'll make a deal. You go first and then I still do not tell you what's wrong.
"
7,1,158,Ted,"Okay. All my friends from high school, are there with their wives and children. And me? My appointment is a dirty magazine.
"
7,1,159,Robin,"As in high school. Sorry, I had to.
"
7,1,160,Ted,"I've always believed in fate, you know? I will go in a magazine Bagel, I would see a pretty girl in the queue reading my favorite novel, whistling the song I had all week in my head, and I would think, ""Wow, this is perhaps the good. "" Now I think ""I just know that bitch will take the latest Bagel.""
"
7,1,161,Robin,"You've been too focused on your work.
"
7,1,162,Ted,"No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight. It's just that every day I think I believe a little less and a little less and less. And... it sucks. What should I do about it, Scherbatsky?
"
7,1,163,Robin,"You're Ted Mosby. You do it again to believe it.
"
7,1,164,Ted,"What, in fate?
"
7,1,165,Robin,"A chemistry. If there is alchemy, you just need another thing.
"
7,1,166,Ted,"What is it?
"
7,1,167,Robin,"The timing. But the timing is a bitch.
"
7,1,168,Ted,"Hey, we always have our market 40 years? If you are still only 40 years...
"
7,1,169,Robin,"I'm all yours. Unrelated, architects make a lot?
"
7,1,170,Ted,"Not enough.
"
7,1,171,Robin,"sh1t.
"
7,1,172,Man,"Schmosby to you in two minutes.
"
7,1,173,Robin,"Ok, promise me two things. One, believe in you again, and two, do not cry during the toast, Schmosby.
"
7,1,174,Ted,"I promise.
"
7,1,175,Lily,"We're having a baby.
"
7,1,176,Robin,"For real?
"
7,1,177,Lily,"For real.
"
7,1,178,"Ted, Barney and Robin","Oh! Oh!
"
7,1,179,Voices,"A little attention everyone! This is the time for which we are all here tonight. The speech Schmosby!
"
7,1,180,Ted,"We are here tonight to celebrate love. The love that brings us a new life...
"
7,1,181,Marshall,"Hey! (Marshall took the microphone from the hands of Ted) This is not a whiner. They are tears of joy. Ted is happy for his friends because it's the best guy I know. And do you know why he is happy? For the beautiful young lady is pregnant here.
"
7,1,182,Kelly,"How did you know...? It must have a secret!
"
7,1,183,Ted (2030),"It turns out that...
"
7,1,184,Kelly,"Will the Browns!
"
7,1,185,Marshall,"In the season's Super Bowl, but if they mean the Super Bowl. Go Vikings!
"
7,1,186,Kelly's father,"How dare you? This is my daughter, sort of junk.
"
7,1,187,Punchy,"You always pay for it all, eh?
"
7,1,188,Punchy's father,"""Species of junk""? This is my son.
"
7,1,189,Ted (2030),"And that's how Marshall has destroyed the marriage of Punchy. But we did not care. It would be a sixth member in our family.
"
7,1,190,Ted,"No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?
"
7,1,191,Barney,"I chose the right tie, huh?
"
7,1,192,Ted,"You've nailed. And be glad it is not the tie-duck. Oh, the tie-duck.
"
7,1,193,Ted (2030),"This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.
"
7,1,194,Barney,"You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?
"
7,1,195,Ted,"Oh, I'll cry too.
"
7,1,196,Barney,"Between.
"
7,1,197,Lily,"Ted, the bride wants to see you. Seriously? Will you be wearing this tie?
"
7,14,1,Robin,"I never let myself believe this day would really come.
"
7,14,2,Mickey,"Wrong!
"
7,14,3,MICKEY (over intercom),"Great news.
"
7,14,4,Ted,"Well...
"
7,14,5,Narrator,"Kids, early in any relationship, there's a phase where you don't say no to anything.
"
7,14,6,(imitating Lily),"Wait, are we sure it's a good idea to go to a strip club?
"
7,14,7,MICKEY (over intercom),"Too bad the one person who could stop you from making mistakes like that was told he has to move out next month.
"
7,14,8,(trailing off),"Party like a rock star...
"
7,14,9,Ted,"Uh, hey, guys.
"
7,14,10,Announcer,"Gentlemen, say hello to J-J-J-Jasmine!
"
7,14,11,Narrator,"So, a while back, we discovered the most amazing thing: Lily had a doppelganger who was a Russian stripper.
"
7,14,12,(chuckling),"I'm totally kidding.
"
7,14,13,Marshall,"Where's the fuse box?
"
7,14,14,Lily,"I don't know.
"
7,14,15,(singsongy),"I know where it is.
"
7,14,16,Marshall,"You know what?
"
7,14,17,Kevin,"Where do I look?
"
7,14,18,MICKEY (over intercom),"Hello, Mr. Eriksen.
"
7,14,19,"This is gonna be awesome, and when it is, I want you all to remember who led you there","Barney Stinson, new group leader.
"
7,14,20,LILY (over intercom),"Marshall, I just remembered I saw a box of matches in the drawer by the trash can.
"
7,14,21,(over intercom),"Ow.
"
7,14,22,MICKEY (muffled),"Hey, Marshall, I know I've been messing with you, but seriously, that second step, don't...
"
7,14,23,(sobbing),"Don't let me be in charge of the gang anymore.
"
7,14,24,(quietly),"I'll never find love.
"
7,14,25,BOTH (weakly),"Sweet.
"
7,14,26,(quietly),"Come on.
"
7,14,27,Narrator,"Fun fact: that night inspired Mickey's one and only successful board game--
"
7,14,28,Mickey,"Brought to you by Aldrin Games!
"
7,14,29,Both,"So...
"
7,14,30,Narrator,"The next morning, Marshall and Lily woke up to a surprise.
"
7,14,31,All,"Oh...
"
7,14,32,Narrator,"It wasn't two weeks.
"
7,2,1,Marshall,"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?
"
7,2,2,Ted,"No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.
"
7,2,3,Robin,"And Miztva Bar next door.
"
7,2,4,Lily,"And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.
"
7,2,5,Marshall,"Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!
"
7,2,6,Ted (2030),"Children, this is not your Uncle Marshall was a problem with the drink. But every time he was a good resolution, we knew about that...
"
7,2,7,Marshall,"I've done it again!
"
7,2,8,Ted (2030),"But I lost a bit in the story.
"
7,2,9,Lily,"What happened to your leg?
"
7,2,10,Barney,"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?
"
7,2,11,Ted,"Lose the cast.
"
7,2,12,Barney,"A one-man show... I love it!
"
7,2,13,Lily,"Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?
"
7,2,14,Barney,"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.
"
7,2,15,Ted,"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.
"
7,2,16,Woman,"Is this you?
"
7,2,17,Ted,"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.
"
7,2,18,Woman,"Hi.
"
7,2,19,Lily,"That's great, Ted.
"
7,2,20,Ted,"It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.
"
7,2,21,Ted,"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby. (With another woman) I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby. (And another) It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of ""An egg on my face"" magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.
"
7,2,22,Ted,"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.
"
7,2,23,Marshall,"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.
"
7,2,24,Ted (2030),"Children, Garrison Cootes was a major partner of Honeywell & Cootes. One of the largest environmental law firms in the United States.Marshall would have given anything to work there.
"
7,2,25,Marshall,"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez! (He finally won) Hello.
"
7,2,26,Garrison,"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working.
"
7,2,27,Marshall,"I love the work you do.
"
7,2,28,Garrison,"It's a...
"
7,2,29,Marshall,"No, I mean it.
"
7,2,30,Garrison,"No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case.
"
7,2,31,Marshall,"He's interested!
"
7,2,32,Garrison,"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you.
"
7,2,33,Marshall,"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!
"
7,2,34,Garrison,"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away.
"
7,2,35,Marshall,"The crocodile you saw?
"
7,2,36,Garrison,"He is coming, yes.
"
7,2,37,Ted (2030),"The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous.
"
7,2,38,Barney,"Hi Nora, thank you for coming.
"
7,2,39,Nora,"What happened to your neck?
"
7,2,40,Barney,"My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene...
"
7,2,41,Nora,"Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.
"
7,2,42,"Barney, turning","What? Where? Oh, and sh1t.
"
7,2,43,Nora,"Breasts...
"
7,2,44,Barney,"Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.
"
7,2,45,Nora,"What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?
"
7,2,46,Barney,"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.
"
7,2,47,Ted,"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.
"
7,2,48,Lily,"Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?
"
7,2,49,Ted,"Define ""serious"".
"
7,2,50,Lily,"Well, it's complicated. I think it would be when you have expectations, emotional involvement...
"
7,2,51,Marshall,"Third base. Seriously, third base.
"
7,2,52,Ted,"So I can go to the second two with no problem?
"
7,2,53,Marshall,"Treat yourself my friend. Treat yourself. Oh no.
"
7,2,54,Ted (2030),"Since Mr. Cootes had mentioned the investigation, Marshall ran through internet. The majority of what he found was touching, seeing truly extraordinary, until...
"
7,2,55,Marshall,"Poor. This is very bad.
"
7,2,56,Girl,"Thank you, Stacy. Wesleyan has a cafeteria. Thank you to the generous donation of... Marshall arrives on camera, naked.
"
7,2,57,Marshall,"Oh! Oh! Someone there mentioned generous donation? I'm Marshall Eriksen. But you can call me Biercules!
"
7,2,58,Lily,"Well, it could be anyone. And thin, I had forgotten this story Biercules.Who made this site first?
"
7,2,59,Marshall,"Pete Durkenson.
"
7,2,60,Ted,"Of course.
"
7,2,61,Robin,"This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?
"
7,2,62,Marshall,"I wanted to join a club that I left three days later, because the clubs are stupid and elitist. And I also discovered that it was not a club.
"
7,2,63,Ted,"Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?
"
7,2,64,Robin,"This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?
"
7,2,65,Ted,"Robin, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Robin, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons.
"
7,2,66,Ted (2030),"And the children they loved.
"
7,2,67,Nora,"Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.
"
7,2,68,Barney,"Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything.
"
7,2,69,Nora,"OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?
"
7,2,70,Barney,"Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.
"
7,2,71,Nora,"More than once?
"
7,2,72,Barney,"More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her.
"
7,2,73,Nora,"They were worth what?
"
7,2,74,Barney,"Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good.
"
7,2,75,Nora,"What was the lie?
"
7,2,76,Barney,"You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?
"
7,2,77,Nora,"A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.
"
7,2,78,Barney,"You are good.
"
7,2,79,Marshall,"Pete, Pete. Hey!
"
7,2,80,Pete,"Biercules! Come here, man.
"
7,2,81,Marshall,"Hey, I tried to call you all night.
"
7,2,82,Pete,"My God, sorry. I should have responded but it was Thursday night.
"
7,2,83,Marshall,"It is Sunday.
"
7,2,84,Pete,"And you know what that means. ""Edward bottles with money""!
"
7,2,85,Ted (2030),"Children, Edward bottles for money is a game that involves taping two bottles of liquor at the base of the hands. The goal is to finish the two bottles. Oh my God, why am I telling you this? Good move.
"
7,2,86,Marshall,"Ok, you know this old video of me?
"
7,2,87,Pete,"I watch it every day.
"
7,2,88,Marshall,"You have to take away the internet. Genre immediately.
"
7,2,89,Pete,"There are two ways for me to do it: Either you give me $ 4 million, or help me to go to the bathroom because I can not...
"
7,2,90,Marshall,"Yes, both are non-negotiable refusal.
"
7,2,91,Pete,"So, I'm sorry we could not handle together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of the game ""to Edward bottles of money,"" and the competition is raised.
"
7,2,92,Marshall,"Who are you playing anyway?
"
7,2,93,Pete,"Just myself.
"
7,2,94,Ted (2030),"Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep.
"
7,2,95,Barney,"I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic.
"
7,2,96,Nora,"Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?
"
7,2,97,Barney,"Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black.
"
7,2,98,Woman,"Barney! Oh no, I knew it.
"
7,2,99,Ted,"I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.
"
7,2,100,Robin,"If architects had only two bullets, eh Ted?
"
7,2,101,Lily,"I knew it. Ted, left or right?
"
7,2,102,Ted,"Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left.
"
7,2,103,"Lily, slapping him","Just called one of the two.
"
7,2,104,Robin,"Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other.
"
7,2,105,Ted,"Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.
"
7,2,106,Robin,"Ok, name one celebrity who will be there.
"
7,2,107,Ted,"Lenny Kravitz.
"
7,2,108,Robin,"Lenny Kravitz will be there?
"
7,2,109,Ted,"Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.
"
7,2,110,Robin,"You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school...
"
7,2,111,Ted,"This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.
"
7,2,112,Lily and Robin,"Scale of colors!
"
7,2,113,Ted (2030),"And the children, we really sang.
"
7,2,114,Marshall,"Pete, please. I am unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. A baby arriving. And I'm about to lose a job that I really need because of a drunken video of 15 years ago.
"
7,2,115,Pete,"Ugh, you mean? Biercules, what's going on? Looks like you're another person. The guy in this video was cool. It had potential. It could have been president of a club one day.
"
7,2,116,Marshall,"There is no club.
"
7,2,117,Pete,"There he is just a troublemaker.
"
7,2,118,Marshall,"It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand.
"
7,2,119,Pete,"Dude, I have 4 children.
"
7,2,120,Marshall,"Pete, please, remove the video.
"
7,2,121,Pete,"Ok, Biercules, I will remove it. If... you can beat me to the game of my choice.
"
7,2,122,Marshall,"Oh no.
"
7,2,123,Pete,"And I choose the beautiful game, the sweet science...
"
7,2,124,Marshall,"Pete, please, I'm tired...
"
7,2,125,Pete,"The sport of kings...
"
7,2,126,Marshall,"I do not want to play Edward bottles money.
"
7,2,127,Pete,"I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!
"
7,2,128,Barney,"And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: ""I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... ""
"
7,2,129,Nora,"Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.
"
7,2,130,Barney,"So that was cool. I can remember, or...?
"
7,2,131,Nora,"Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.
"
7,2,132,Barney,"Well, I count three for and one against.
"
7,2,133,Nora,"How can you still believe you have a chance with me?
"
7,2,134,Barney,"Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change.
"
7,2,135,Nora,"How I know this is not a lie?
"
7,2,136,Barney,"I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.
"
7,2,137,Nora,"Goodbye Barney.
"
7,2,138,Barney,"I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.
"
7,2,139,Ted,"Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not.
"
7,2,140,Lily,"Well, it looks like Jessica wins in the first four categories.
"
7,2,141,Ted,"Do not fight in...
"
7,2,142,Robin,"Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty.
"
7,2,143,Ted,"What big event?
"
7,2,144,Robin,"This thing with your uncle.
"
7,2,145,Ted,"His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma.
"
7,2,146,Robin,"And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?
"
7,2,147,Marshall,"I've done it again!
"
7,2,148,Lily,"Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet.
"
7,2,149,Marshall,"Just to be clear, ""I've done it again!""... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation.
"
7,2,150,Lily,"What does it therefore reference?
"
7,2,151,Marshall,"My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!
"
7,2,152,Lily,"Well... it could be anyone...
"
7,2,153,Pete,"Oh, God...
"
7,2,154,Lily,"Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little dick.
"
7,2,155,Ted,"Pete has a small dick?
"
7,2,156,Lily,"I have no idea. Well, what do you take?
"
7,2,157,Marshall,"It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... ""side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing"" he rebelled and has struggled!
"
7,2,158,Robin,"It's for sure!
"
7,2,159,Marshall's voice,"Look at me! I am a windmill!
"
7,2,160,Marshall,"Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?
"
7,2,161,Lily,"But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, ""Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! ""
"
7,2,162,Barney,"Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!
"
7,2,163,Robin,"Barney, what are you doing here?
"
7,2,164,Barney,"Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned.
"
7,2,165,Ted,"That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.
"
7,2,166,Lily,"Yes, the stupid thing that makes us turn the head, pretty cool.
"
7,2,167,Marshall,"It's not bad. Also, for posterity, a statement drunk guy! I would not drink again.
"
7,2,168,Ted (2030),"And of course...
"
7,2,169,Marshall,"Carpet Biercules! Yeah!
"
7,2,170,Ted (2030),"But again, I digress.
"
7,2,171,Marshall,"Hello?
"
7,2,172,Garrison,"Marshall! Garrison Cootes.
"
7,2,173,Marshall,"Yes, Mr Cootes. How are you?
"
7,2,174,Garrison,"I wanted you to know we had conducted our inquiries, and there is something annoying.
"
7,2,175,Marshall,"Sir, the fact is that...
"
7,2,176,Garrison,"The rainbow in this sample is definitely related to chemical plants. Ok, I... Skip a line... We love you! It takes you.
"
7,2,177,Marshall,"It's fantastic. Thank you, Mr Cootes.
"
7,2,178,Garrison,"Well, nothing. Oh, and when you're in the office, try to wear something Biercules. Ok? Wow, that was a big snake.
"
7,2,179,Marshall,"Oh, there was a snake in the swamp?
"
7,2,180,Garrison,"No, I was talking about your pen1s. See you tomorrow.
"
7,2,181,Marshall,"I got the job.
"
7,2,182,Lily,"Yes!
"
7,2,183,Marshall,"And I think my boss is already sexually harassing me. But he saw the video and he does not care!
"
7,2,184,Lily,"Saw what? Maybe the video is not so bad after all.
"
7,2,185,Marshall,"Yes. Hello?
"
7,2,186,Pete,"Hey Marshall, I'm Pete Durkenson. We all went to Wesleyan.
"
7,2,187,Marshall,"Yes, no, I know. Pete, we drank together yesterday.
"
7,2,188,Pete,"Absolutely, now, the message from Lily makes sense. Listen, do not worry Bro ', I remove the video.
"
7,2,189,Marshall,"You know what? Let her.
"
7,2,190,Pete,"As you wish, Biercules. (He hangs up and is in an operating room with a man on the table) Scalpel.
"
7,2,191,Marshall,"You know what? That's good. I want my children to see every part of me.
"
7,2,192,Lily,"Yes. Even the side where you route the East Village naked.
"
7,2,193,Marshall,"I will remember Pete.
"
7,2,194,Lily,"It's a good idea.
"
7,2,195,Ted (2030),"That night, I brought Robin Bal.
"
7,2,196,Robin,"Thanks for taking me.
"
7,2,197,Ted,"The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York.
"
7,2,198,Robin,"Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?
"
7,2,199,Ted,"Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams.
"
7,2,200,Robin,"Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself.
"
7,2,201,Ted,"Ok
"
7,2,202,Ted (2030),"Children, you can not control when falling in love. It does not take days to think about. When this happens, you know quickly and with absolute certainty. I had forgotten. But reminded myself it was going.
"
7,16,1,All,"Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night!
"
7,16,2,That's the problem with E.P.S.,"lack of awareness.
"
7,16,3,It's called,"I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
"
7,16,4,Lily,"Just a bunch of drunk, sloppy idiots, fresh off a night of partying in the city, just desperate to hook up with anything that moves.
"
7,16,5,Marshall,"See you.
"
7,16,6,Narrator,"For Valentine's weekend, Lily and Marshall invited Kevin and Robin on a couple's getaway to Vermont.
"
7,16,7,Both,"Mmm.
"
7,16,8,Marshall,"Mm. What's your secret?
"
7,16,9,Lily,"Yeah, like how Barney's holding these three hours over Ted's head.
"
7,16,10,Narrator,"That night, Barney and I found ourselves in a strange, new universe called...
"
7,16,11,(panting),"Ted! Ted! Ted!
"
7,16,12,(in high-pitched voice),"I don't think you did.
"
7,16,13,(whispers loudly),"Propose!
"
7,16,14,Marshall,"You know what, Robin?
"
7,16,15,"Ted, when I was at M.I.T., my favorite Einstein quote was","""God doesn't play dice with the universe.""
"
7,16,16,Narrator,"The next morning, Robin mustered up all her courage and finally told Kevin her secret.
"
7,16,17,All,"Oh...!
"
7,16,18,"Okay, I'll give you this","You stood by your boy all night, even though you have no chance of getting with me.
"
7,16,19,Narrator,"Kids, sometimes you realize
"
7,16,20,"So, the question becomes","Where do you go next?
"
7,16,21,Announcer,"Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
"
7,17,1,Narrator,"Kids, I'll never forget the first time I told your mother I loved her.
"
7,17,2,TED (to self),"What the hell was that?
"
7,17,3,Narrator,"Oh, yeah, Aunt Robin was thrilled World Wide News asked her to go to Moscow to cover Maslenitsa.
"
7,17,4,"Uh, our flight leaves at 9","0 p.m., not a.m.
"
7,17,5,"But, Robin, the schedule says 9","0 a.m. and my ticket says 9:00 a.m. and all the e-mail reminders said 9:00 a.m. and our boss in the car downstairs said...
"
7,17,6,It's 7,"0 a.m.
"
7,17,7,(over phone),"Double A Cleaning.
"
7,17,8,(sultry),"Mmm, we'll continue this... when I get back.
"
7,17,9,Narrator,"That's why.
"
7,17,10,Narrator,"So, Lily was betting against me and Robin.
"
7,17,11,Narrator,"And Marshall and Lily explained.
"
7,17,12,Narrator,"And then I realized why Robin and I hadn't gotten back together in the last five years.
"
7,17,13,Narrator,"And then Barney told me everything.
"
7,17,14,"Okay, but, Barney, just remember, you'll also be seeing a lot of this","Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
"
7,17,15,"And by the end of the night, one thing had become clear",
7,17,16,Narrator,"Here's the funny thing: In my own crazy way, I was kind of happy.
"
7,17,17,Lily,"For Ted's sake, I hate to say this,
"
7,3,1,Marshall,"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?
"
7,3,2,Ted,"No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.
"
7,3,3,Robin,"And Miztva Bar next door.
"
7,3,4,Lily,"And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.
"
7,3,5,Marshall,"Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!
"
7,3,6,Ted (2030),"Children, this is not your Uncle Marshall was a problem with the drink. But every time he was a good resolution, we knew about that...
"
7,3,7,Marshall,"I've done it again!
"
7,3,8,Ted (2030),"But I lost a bit in the story.
"
7,3,9,Lily,"What happened to your leg?
"
7,3,10,Barney,"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?
"
7,3,11,Ted,"Lose the cast.
"
7,3,12,Barney,"A one-man show... I love it!
"
7,3,13,Lily,"Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?
"
7,3,14,Barney,"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.
"
7,3,15,Ted,"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.
"
7,3,16,Woman,"Is this you?
"
7,3,17,Ted,"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.
"
7,3,18,Woman,"Hi.
"
7,3,19,Lily,"That's great, Ted.
"
7,3,20,Ted,"It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.
"
7,3,21,Ted,"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby. (With another woman) I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby. (And another) It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of ""An egg on my face"" magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.
"
7,3,22,Ted,"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.
"
7,3,23,Marshall,"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.
"
7,3,24,Ted (2030),"Children, Garrison Cootes was a major partner of Honeywell & Cootes. One of the largest environmental law firms in the United States.Marshall would have given anything to work there.
"
7,3,25,Marshall,"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez! (He finally won) Hello.
"
7,3,26,Garrison,"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working.
"
7,3,27,Marshall,"I love the work you do.
"
7,3,28,Garrison,"It's a...
"
7,3,29,Marshall,"No, I mean it.
"
7,3,30,Garrison,"No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case.
"
7,3,31,Marshall,"He's interested!
"
7,3,32,Garrison,"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you.
"
7,3,33,Marshall,"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!
"
7,3,34,Garrison,"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away.
"
7,3,35,Marshall,"The crocodile you saw?
"
7,3,36,Garrison,"He is coming, yes.
"
7,3,37,Ted (2030),"The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous.
"
7,3,38,Barney,"Hi Nora, thank you for coming.
"
7,3,39,Nora,"What happened to your neck?
"
7,3,40,Barney,"My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene...
"
7,3,41,Nora,"Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.
"
7,3,42,"Barney, turning","What? Where? Oh, and sh1t.
"
7,3,43,Nora,"Breasts...
"
7,3,44,Barney,"Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.
"
7,3,45,Nora,"What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?
"
7,3,46,Barney,"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.
"
7,3,47,Ted,"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.
"
7,3,48,Lily,"Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?
"
7,3,49,Ted,"Define ""serious"".
"
7,3,50,Lily,"Well, it's complicated. I think it would be when you have expectations, emotional involvement...
"
7,3,51,Marshall,"Third base. Seriously, third base.
"
7,3,52,Ted,"So I can go to the second two with no problem?
"
7,3,53,Marshall,"Treat yourself my friend. Treat yourself. Oh no.
"
7,3,54,Ted (2030),"Since Mr. Cootes had mentioned the investigation, Marshall ran through internet. The majority of what he found was touching, seeing truly extraordinary, until...
"
7,3,55,Marshall,"Poor. This is very bad.
"
7,3,56,Girl,"Thank you, Stacy. Wesleyan has a cafeteria. Thank you to the generous donation of... Marshall arrives on camera, naked.
"
7,3,57,Marshall,"Oh! Oh! Someone there mentioned generous donation? I'm Marshall Eriksen. But you can call me Biercules!
"
7,3,58,Lily,"Well, it could be anyone. And thin, I had forgotten this story Biercules.Who made this site first?
"
7,3,59,Marshall,"Pete Durkenson.
"
7,3,60,Ted,"Of course.
"
7,3,61,Robin,"This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?
"
7,3,62,Marshall,"I wanted to join a club that I left three days later, because the clubs are stupid and elitist. And I also discovered that it was not a club.
"
7,3,63,Ted,"Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?
"
7,3,64,Robin,"This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?
"
7,3,65,Ted,"Robin, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Robin, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons.
"
7,3,66,Ted (2030),"And the children they loved.
"
7,3,67,Nora,"Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.
"
7,3,68,Barney,"Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything.
"
7,3,69,Nora,"OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?
"
7,3,70,Barney,"Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.
"
7,3,71,Nora,"More than once?
"
7,3,72,Barney,"More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her.
"
7,3,73,Nora,"They were worth what?
"
7,3,74,Barney,"Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good.
"
7,3,75,Nora,"What was the lie?
"
7,3,76,Barney,"You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?
"
7,3,77,Nora,"A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.
"
7,3,78,Barney,"You are good.
"
7,3,79,Marshall,"Pete, Pete. Hey!
"
7,3,80,Pete,"Biercules! Come here, man.
"
7,3,81,Marshall,"Hey, I tried to call you all night.
"
7,3,82,Pete,"My God, sorry. I should have responded but it was Thursday night.
"
7,3,83,Marshall,"It is Sunday.
"
7,3,84,Pete,"And you know what that means. ""Edward bottles with money""!
"
7,3,85,Ted (2030),"Children, Edward bottles for money is a game that involves taping two bottles of liquor at the base of the hands. The goal is to finish the two bottles. Oh my God, why am I telling you this? Good move.
"
7,3,86,Marshall,"Ok, you know this old video of me?
"
7,3,87,Pete,"I watch it every day.
"
7,3,88,Marshall,"You have to take away the internet. Genre immediately.
"
7,3,89,Pete,"There are two ways for me to do it: Either you give me $ 4 million, or help me to go to the bathroom because I can not...
"
7,3,90,Marshall,"Yes, both are non-negotiable refusal.
"
7,3,91,Pete,"So, I'm sorry we could not handle together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of the game ""to Edward bottles of money,"" and the competition is raised.
"
7,3,92,Marshall,"Who are you playing anyway?
"
7,3,93,Pete,"Just myself.
"
7,3,94,Ted (2030),"Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep.
"
7,3,95,Barney,"I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic.
"
7,3,96,Nora,"Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?
"
7,3,97,Barney,"Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black.
"
7,3,98,Woman,"Barney! Oh no, I knew it.
"
7,3,99,Ted,"I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.
"
7,3,100,Robin,"If architects had only two bullets, eh Ted?
"
7,3,101,Lily,"I knew it. Ted, left or right?
"
7,3,102,Ted,"Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left.
"
7,3,103,"Lily, slapping him","Just called one of the two.
"
7,3,104,Robin,"Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other.
"
7,3,105,Ted,"Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.
"
7,3,106,Robin,"Ok, name one celebrity who will be there.
"
7,3,107,Ted,"Lenny Kravitz.
"
7,3,108,Robin,"Lenny Kravitz will be there?
"
7,3,109,Ted,"Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.
"
7,3,110,Robin,"You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school...
"
7,3,111,Ted,"This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.
"
7,3,112,Lily and Robin,"Scale of colors!
"
7,3,113,Ted (2030),"And the children, we really sang.
"
7,3,114,Marshall,"Pete, please. I am unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. A baby arriving. And I'm about to lose a job that I really need because of a drunken video of 15 years ago.
"
7,3,115,Pete,"Ugh, you mean? Biercules, what's going on? Looks like you're another person. The guy in this video was cool. It had potential. It could have been president of a club one day.
"
7,3,116,Marshall,"There is no club.
"
7,3,117,Pete,"There he is just a troublemaker.
"
7,3,118,Marshall,"It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand.
"
7,3,119,Pete,"Dude, I have 4 children.
"
7,3,120,Marshall,"Pete, please, remove the video.
"
7,3,121,Pete,"Ok, Biercules, I will remove it. If... you can beat me to the game of my choice.
"
7,3,122,Marshall,"Oh no.
"
7,3,123,Pete,"And I choose the beautiful game, the sweet science...
"
7,3,124,Marshall,"Pete, please, I'm tired...
"
7,3,125,Pete,"The sport of kings...
"
7,3,126,Marshall,"I do not want to play Edward bottles money.
"
7,3,127,Pete,"I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!
"
7,3,128,Barney,"And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: ""I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... ""
"
7,3,129,Nora,"Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.
"
7,3,130,Barney,"So that was cool. I can remember, or...?
"
7,3,131,Nora,"Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.
"
7,3,132,Barney,"Well, I count three for and one against.
"
7,3,133,Nora,"How can you still believe you have a chance with me?
"
7,3,134,Barney,"Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change.
"
7,3,135,Nora,"How I know this is not a lie?
"
7,3,136,Barney,"I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.
"
7,3,137,Nora,"Goodbye Barney.
"
7,3,138,Barney,"I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.
"
7,3,139,Ted,"Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not.
"
7,3,140,Lily,"Well, it looks like Jessica wins in the first four categories.
"
7,3,141,Ted,"Do not fight in...
"
7,3,142,Robin,"Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty.
"
7,3,143,Ted,"What big event?
"
7,3,144,Robin,"This thing with your uncle.
"
7,3,145,Ted,"His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma.
"
7,3,146,Robin,"And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?
"
7,3,147,Marshall,"I've done it again!
"
7,3,148,Lily,"Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet.
"
7,3,149,Marshall,"Just to be clear, ""I've done it again!""... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation.
"
7,3,150,Lily,"What does it therefore reference?
"
7,3,151,Marshall,"My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!
"
7,3,152,Lily,"Well... it could be anyone...
"
7,3,153,Pete,"Oh, God...
"
7,3,154,Lily,"Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little dick.
"
7,3,155,Ted,"Pete has a small dick?
"
7,3,156,Lily,"I have no idea. Well, what do you take?
"
7,3,157,Marshall,"It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... ""side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing"" he rebelled and has struggled!
"
7,3,158,Robin,"It's for sure!
"
7,3,159,Marshall's voice,"Look at me! I am a windmill!
"
7,3,160,Marshall,"Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?
"
7,3,161,Lily,"But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, ""Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! ""
"
7,3,162,Barney,"Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!
"
7,3,163,Robin,"Barney, what are you doing here?
"
7,3,164,Barney,"Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned.
"
7,3,165,Ted,"That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.
"
7,3,166,Lily,"Yes, the stupid thing that makes us turn the head, pretty cool.
"
7,3,167,Marshall,"It's not bad. Also, for posterity, a statement drunk guy! I would not drink again.
"
7,3,168,Ted (2030),"And of course...
"
7,3,169,Marshall,"Carpet Biercules! Yeah!
"
7,3,170,Ted (2030),"But again, I digress.
"
7,3,171,Marshall,"Hello?
"
7,3,172,Garrison,"Marshall! Garrison Cootes.
"
7,3,173,Marshall,"Yes, Mr Cootes. How are you?
"
7,3,174,Garrison,"I wanted you to know we had conducted our inquiries, and there is something annoying.
"
7,3,175,Marshall,"Sir, the fact is that...
"
7,3,176,Garrison,"The rainbow in this sample is definitely related to chemical plants. Ok, I... Skip a line... We love you! It takes you.
"
7,3,177,Marshall,"It's fantastic. Thank you, Mr Cootes.
"
7,3,178,Garrison,"Well, nothing. Oh, and when you're in the office, try to wear something Biercules. Ok? Wow, that was a big snake.
"
7,3,179,Marshall,"Oh, there was a snake in the swamp?
"
7,3,180,Garrison,"No, I was talking about your pen1s. See you tomorrow.
"
7,3,181,Marshall,"I got the job.
"
7,3,182,Lily,"Yes!
"
7,3,183,Marshall,"And I think my boss is already sexually harassing me. But he saw the video and he does not care!
"
7,3,184,Lily,"Saw what? Maybe the video is not so bad after all.
"
7,3,185,Marshall,"Yes. Hello?
"
7,3,186,Pete,"Hey Marshall, I'm Pete Durkenson. We all went to Wesleyan.
"
7,3,187,Marshall,"Yes, no, I know. Pete, we drank together yesterday.
"
7,3,188,Pete,"Absolutely, now, the message from Lily makes sense. Listen, do not worry Bro ', I remove the video.
"
7,3,189,Marshall,"You know what? Let her.
"
7,3,190,Pete,"As you wish, Biercules. (He hangs up and is in an operating room with a man on the table) Scalpel.
"
7,3,191,Marshall,"You know what? That's good. I want my children to see every part of me.
"
7,3,192,Lily,"Yes. Even the side where you route the East Village naked.
"
7,3,193,Marshall,"I will remember Pete.
"
7,3,194,Lily,"It's a good idea.
"
7,3,195,Ted (2030),"That night, I brought Robin Bal.
"
7,3,196,Robin,"Thanks for taking me.
"
7,3,197,Ted,"The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York.
"
7,3,198,Robin,"Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?
"
7,3,199,Ted,"Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams.
"
7,3,200,Robin,"Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself.
"
7,3,201,Ted,"Ok
"
7,3,202,Ted (2030),"Children, you can not control when falling in love. It does not take days to think about. When this happens, you know quickly and with absolute certainty. I had forgotten. But reminded myself it was going.
"
7,7,1,Narrator,"Kids, in the fall of 2011, all of my friends were in relationships.

7,7,2,(British accent),"Hello again, my darlings.

7,7,3,Narrator,"So, later that night, Barney and Nora went skating.

7,7,4,Narrator,"Now, kids, for most guys, this would have meant the end of the date.

7,7,6,And then it hit me,"a board game!

7,7,8,Man,"Good-bye, cruel world!
"
7,7,9,(whispers),"Sure.
"
7,7,10,Narrator,"Now, Kevin, as a trained psychologist, knew the appropriate way to voice his displeasure.
"
7,7,11,Narrator,"Instead, he took a different approach.

7,7,12,Narrator,"But then Marshall really started thinking about Kevin's theory.

7,13,6,Marshall,"So you haven't told your dad that you're pregnant yet?
"
7,13,7,Marshall,"Anyway, Dad, Ted and Barney's New Year's Eve wasn't off to a great start, either.
"
7,13,8,Narrator,"Kids, here's why we didn't have a problem with that.
